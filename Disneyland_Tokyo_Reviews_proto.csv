1,5.0,Apr 2022,"Kyiv, Ukraine ",Wonderful,"Wonderful! Even though It was rainy Sunday, there were full of stories and magical sighting seeings!Not so long waiting time for each attraction. Food from Chinese restaurant, named by China voyager, so quite good.Many of staff were welcoming and nice enough to enjoy all. No English voice guide, but it was easy to fully involved into with very well known Disney’s stories."
2,5.0,May 2021,"Shellharbour, Australia ",Amazing!!!,My family & I visited Disney Sea in April 2019. As a family we truly loved it. The atmosphere was electric. The park was spotless. We found the staff to be incredibly friendly and very helpful. Language was not a problem.
3,5.0,Mar 2021,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates ",Tokyo,Great place to spend time with young children. Take tons of pictures. Even adults can enjoy the visit too. You can also buy souvenirs for friends n family
4,2.0,Dec 2021,"Tokyo Prefecture, Japan ",Very little COVID measures,"When we got there, there was a huge line without any social distance just to enter the park. Over 500 people waiting on line without any extra space near the parking lot area. Nobody asked to see our vaccination passports and the ""health check"" was a mere temperature check.All annoucements were in Japanese, and they just yelled as if it had been a countryside fair or something. I am fluent in Japanese, and despite the fact I asked the staff questions in Japanese, they would just refuse to listen to the questions and walk away. This happened several times while inside as well.I only saw sanitizing stations at the entrance of attractions and toilets. Nothing by the popcorn kioks.There were lines for everything, and it was overcrowded.Don't waste your money going there because everything is just a neverending row of window-dressing procedures. For instance, we were kicked out of a parade-watching area because the clerk wasn't happy with the place we had sat on—despite the fact another clerk had said earlier we could sit there in both English and Japanese. The woman that kicked us out just yelled in broken English and didn't even try in Japanese.Food was also subpar. We had lunch at the restaurant near Splash Mountain, and the food was cold. Flavorwise, the food was good, but cold.We got tickets that were almost ¥9,000 (roughly $85 dollars) just to be told that there were no tickets to access the Beauty and the Beast attraction. When I asked, the staff just repeated like echo pedals, the favorites Japanese phrase ""申し訳ありません/I'm sorry"" as if that solved anything. Tokyo Disneyland has been the worst so far. Very little carw about customers, excessive yelling, and lines for everything.Don't waste your money and go to Hong Kong Disneyland instead; the staff there are more welcoming and you won't need near-native Japanese to enjoy rides (the narration is only in Japanese, and there isn't even a chance to understand what is happening when you aren't fluent in the language). Clerks don't even try. They just vomit Japanese at full speed, and if you don't catch it, they just ignore you and use pointing.I would not recommend it to anyone, actually not until COVID is over because without measures, itat too risky. Their measures are window-dressing, just to do well statistically. In reality nobody gave a damn about distance, and when you enforced it, people would cut in line."
5,3.0,Dec 2021,N/A,Not what it used to be...,"Nowhere what it used to be.  Have been going for more than 30 years and it seems to be all about pinching the penny these days.  You can no longer ride the major attractions more than once (Soaring, Toy Story).  The all you can eat restaurants are gone.  The food prices have gone up and the portions haven gotten smaller.  They have cut off Wifi in some restaurants to increase table turnovers - which is not a bad idea, but some folks like a little Wifi while eating.  Tickets are almost impossible to get.  The ticket scalping has gotten out of control - I believe they are working on this now.  The new attractions have been disasters.  Closing down 'day at the races' and replacing it with Beauty and the Beast is a Big, BIG BIG mistake.  They should have gone EV.  The attractions are not going full tilt.  They lie and tell you that they are doing  maintenance.  The stock may be going up and up but the park itself is going down and down.  Maybe this is the sign of the times.  Disney used to have great value, now it is just someplace like a park where you walk around in circles taking in smells and scenery - sort of VR ish.  I don't mind paying more for value but it is not here.   You are paying more for mediocre business decisions.  This is entertainment and using the Covid as an  excuse to take everything away while increasing prices will eventually make folks reevaluate Universal Studios.  Come on DISNEY, wake up."
6,5.0,Dec 2021,N/A,Pretty place,"I really love those cute costumes and lovely dolls. Also, when I walk in there, I thought that I just like a child, and I can dream everything I want."
7,1.0,Nov 2021,"Anjo, Japan ",Worst online website,Online reservation is terrible. It’s almost impossible to booked your tickets here. Their website is useless. For a big theme park like disney they must be prepared in this kind of situation specially during Christmas and New Year
8,1.0,Dec 2020,"Islamabad, Pakistan ",The staff is lazy and arrogant,"The place is good but the staff is unfriendly , lazy and arrogant. Probably i wont visit it again for the bad behavior of the staff. I  went there in July 2019, still remember my bad experience."
9,5.0,Nov 2020,Philippines ,Happiest place on earth!,"I visited Tokyo Disneyland few months before the pandemic started and so far, it's the best theme park that I visited.I endured long queues and it's worth it as their attractions are really amazing and entertaining. The park parades are awesome!Tokyo Disneyland’s highlight of the night where fireworks display gives bright colors to the evening sky. It’s a musical show perfect to end the night with a smile. It seems though that the fireworks are outside the premises of Disneyland however this gives a night to remember.Truly the happiest place on Earth!"
10,5.0,Feb 2021,"Hong Kong, China ",very exciting,"there are alot of thing to do there,such as rides. but you have to walk and line up in every station."
