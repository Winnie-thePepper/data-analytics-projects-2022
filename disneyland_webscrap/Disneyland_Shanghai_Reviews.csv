1,5.0,May 2021,"London, UK ",Best Disneyland I’ve been to! (So far),"Best Disneyland I have been to! (So far…) I have Been to a variety of Disneyland’s, Paris and a few others, but I would have to Say this was the best one I’ve been to! It is truly magical and deserves five stars."
2,3.0,Jun 2021,"Toronto, Canada ",Go to Disney somewhere else,"After experiencing Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in Anaheim, Disney Shanghai is a big disappointment.  There don't seem to be any rides and all of the rides they do have, you need to line up for hours just to ride.  We got there and got through the gates just after 10am and left at 8pm and were able to go on only 4 rides!  The parade was very short, with only a couple of floats.  The food up near Iron had a vegan burger which I thought was good.  It has the feel of Disney yet something seems to be missing."
3,5.0,Dec 2021,"Shenzhen, China ",Christmas magic,A pretty magical place. Rides were amazing and the experience smooth and easy even with small kids in tow. Recommend two days and hotel stay to get the most value. Early entry and fast pass invaluable.Dining experience in the park was poor; best eat in the village outside the gates.Fireworks show on Xmas day was an unforgettable experience. Upon leaving my thoughts turns to when I’ll come back…
4,4.0,Dec 2021,"Washington, ",Disney is always a happy place!,Lovely visit. Not many exciting rides but nice to walk around. Food is not that good as it is of food court style. Better to dine at Disneytown. Mickey’s Parade was fun. Fireworks display at night was fantastic.
5,5.0,Dec 2021,"Shanghai, China, ",Magical,"What an amazing magical place especially for Christmas . So great and totally worth a visit , good rides, good food in the town just a magical happy place ."
6,4.0,Sep 2021,United Kingdom ,Pretty good,"It was pretty good. Overall I enjoyed the experience, but I personally prefer the ones in America as the rides are more exciting."
7,1.0,Oct 2021,N/A,Ruined Disney Experience for Chinese and Foreign Couple,"Me and my partner had a bad experience at Disneyland. We purchased two nights at the Toy Story Hotel and tickets for the second day. When we arrived, three members of staff all told us that we needed to go to Disney Town the next morning to collect the tickets. So at 07:00 in the morning, we took a bus to Disney Town..But we were told by the staff there that there was no record or proof that we had purchased the tickets and that we needed to get confirmation from the hotel! So this meant, me and my partner, taking the bus BACK to the hotel only for them to give us tickets to get in to the park. What a mess! It really ruined our mood. At first I thought it could have been a misunderstanding, but we are both fluent in Chinese and English, yet they said the same thing in both languages. Lack of experience? I don't know. But it really ruined our experienced as we didn't get into the park until 10:00am when it was already crowded."
8,5.0,Sep 2020,Austria ,A place for your inner child,"Visited the park in 2019, pre-Covid and had a blast.The queues weren’t too bad, as we found out we picked quite a good day for our visit and we were able to enjoy almost all of the attractions we were interested in.Even on a not so busy day, some of the attractions were a bit busy and we were thinking that a fast pass would have been a good idea…but then again, the concept of fast passes is a bit of a wallet burning idea.TRON ride is a unique experience that was something else and we really enjoyed Star Wars hall - the 2 meters high Lord Vader was stealing the show.The Pirates of the Caribbean are also a must, as the visual effects are incredible, especially compared to some European parks.Most of us have been to a few amusement parks and this was one of the better ones - however, you should come prepared, as the prices inside are quite high and English translations are not present everywhere."
9,4.0,Jul 2021,N/A,Disney Magic With a Billion People…,"I am a huge fan of Florida’s Disney World and have been to Disneyland California and Hong Kong. When I moved to China I was very excited to visit this Disneyland the first chance I had. With that said, while the overall experience was fun and had Disney magic, I was a little disappointed. From what I have read the park had changed post-COVID and not for the better. Bottom Line: if you’re a Disney super fan like me and prepared for huge crowds the beauty and uniqueness of this park is worth it. Otherwise the crowds and long lines without free fastpass make this park a challenge!! Details: 1) be prepared for HUGE crowds. We went on a weekday and I would hate to see it on a weekend. LONG lines for everything, even bag check + entry turnstiles took about 1.5 hrs (standing in hot direct sun). 2) We arrived 1.5 hours before park opened and got in 5 minutes after opening. The line for some big rides (Soarin) was already almost 3 hours. They do sell early access passes so this might be worth it but I think with crowds from the resorts entering early it would still be very busy. 3) Fastpass. This was the biggest and most frustrating change of all. There are NO free fastpass. You can buy fastpass in packages or for single rides but it’s EXPENSIVE- one pass was 180RMB or about $28!! That’s crazy. And with the giant lines…you have to choose either to just wait or pay up. :/ 4) As for lines- as a frequent visitor of WDW in Florida I was very surprised that early morning lines were actually longer than late morning-early afternoon. Keep an eye on the wait times in the app and try to ride during the afternoon, parades, etc. The Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and Tron had manageable (1 hr or less) lines during the night shows so this is a good option if you’re not watching the night show. As for the night show, plan to stake out a spot around 6:30 for the 8pm show if you want a decent view of the castle.  5) The food is not good and is very expensive (more expensive than WDW). Many people have posted that you can’t bring in food; this is not the case in 2021. We packed plenty of snacks but in hindsight I wish we would have packed actual lunch/dinner food. If you do have to eat in the park, Tangled Tree Tavern wasn’t bad. The slightly better and slightly less expensive food is just outside the park in Disneytown- a separate area you can enter/exit throughout the day with your park ticket. The ice cream in Disneytown is very good and will only set you back about $5 instead of the $10 charged in the park. 6) The Tron and Pirate rides are amazing!! Even impressed my husband who is not as much of a Disney fanatic. :) 7) The park is beautiful and SO BIG! The attention to detail you expect from Disney was amazing. 8) We live in China so we were prepared for “Chinese” behavior, which may come as a shock to other visitors. Yes, there is a lot of pushing and crowding. And we did see one little boy peeing on the pavement in front of the castle. Be prepared for pushing and other things you won’t see in America. It’s just China and it’s shocking and gross but you aren’t in America after all! Also the shows and rides are mostly in Mandarin and staff generally speaks little English. also download the Shanghai Disney app and a good VPN (we use ExpressVPN) before you come. As of July 2021 there are very little COVID measures. You have to buy/book your ticket in advance but there’s no social distancing and infrequent mask wearing."
10,5.0,Apr 2021,"Hawkshaw, UK ",Great trip for a foreigner solo traveler,"I booked a 2 day pass on the official website before arrive in Shanghai (around ¥800 weekday 2 day ticket). The subway line 11 arrives straight into the resort! Make sure you buy a return ticket as soon as you arrive! (it will save time when you return)! Day 1: Great day, weather wasn’t the best! It rained which meant that a few rides were suspended until the storm had passed! There is a parade at 12:15pm which is worth watching! Around a 1 hour and less wait for the rides! Day 2: Another great day, although this was a Friday. The park seemed much busier. There were 1/2 hours waits for the rides! There are a mixture of Chinese and western food! The bakery is a much visit!"
11,5.0,Apr 2021,"Beijing, China ",Perfect Spring Break!,"I don’t understand what is the fuss about with most people who visited Shanghai Disneyland. It’s a theme park and it WILL be crowded from time to time. And this is China. There WILL be people.We visited the park for four consecutive days buying two 2-day tickets each and found this was totally worth it every yuan. The staff at the park are polite, helpful, kind to children and help out however they can. The rides are great! Yes there are queues, and if one plans timings well, like missing the morning parade to do a “Soaring over the Horizon”, or doing TRON during Chinese dinner time, one will find practically no queues. I did buy a fast pass, only because we didn’t want to wait for 60 mins as we wanted to finish Winnie The Pooh ride and go for lunch. It’s a personal choice.If I were only with adults, queues are no big deal, but with little children I preferred a fast pass one day for a chosen ride. Food in the park is good. Limited options for vegetarians like me, but one can always go into Disneytown, eat and come back with the same ticket. It’s allowed! I find that extremely convenient!!!One can never cover everything in the park even after 4 days. It’s really big compared to HK. We loved the park although I wish they should add some specific timings for the English narration of the Pooh ride. We shall return!"
12,4.0,Apr 2021,"Chengdu, China, ",Wear Comfy Shoes and be prepared to queue!,"To enter the park you need to walk from the car park, queue up for the security check, and pass the ticket office, this is a long walk, and took 90 mins. As you must reserve your ticket at least 1day in advance, remember to bring your ID with you ( photo of your passport is fine. The park is massive, today involved a lot of walking and queueing. The top attraction waiting time was constantly three hours so we missed it out but with Pirates of the Caribbean and Tron there was plenty to do.Left tired but happy twelve hours later"
13,3.0,Apr 2021,"Shanghai, China ","good, if you are ready to pay extra 1300 per person","ADVICES to save time and nerves:GET Disnay APP in advance . Be VERY VERY early. BUy transparent water-resistant neck purse for the phone to make videos of your rides. BRING your food with you. IT will save you time.BAD app system. Presumably, you can book a ""stand by pass"" (which used to be free fast pass )  in the official Disney app, once you have a real paper ticket on hands and link it. BUT....its gets fully booked in the first 10 mins after the first people get in and nothing was available after that. WELL DONE, Disnay!  it was a very frustrating part!  PLEASE go back to manual stands inside the park where people used to book 1 free pass for every 2 hours!!!!!! it Was FAIR to everyone!You can buy a fast pass package for single or multiple rides on app. We took most expensive 800 rmb (additionally to 400 rmb ticket)  per person. So tot 1300 gives you access to fast pass of pre-selected by Disney 6 rides (we did 7 or 8 in total from 8:40 till 15:00) . It was a nice experience.  The service was good (we exchanged 1 atraction, as there were technical issues with  1 ride on the list. so we changed it, )l personnel was very helpful and well trained. I gave 3 stars because of the system glitch (was on and off during the day) and the MAIN point because we haven't got a single stand-by pass. This  SYSTEM doesn't really work !"
14,3.0,Apr 2021,"Ko Samet, Thailand ",Crowds and Line-ups a-plenty!,"If you want to spend the day spending lots of money and then lining up then this is your place!  We tried to go on a day that might not have the crowds. That was ambitious. I don't think there is every a day like that. It seemed like there aren't a lot of great rides but we did love Pirates of the Caribbean, Roaring Rapids, Tron, Buzz Lightyear, Peter Pan and Woody's Roundup. We certainly got our step count up as you wander all over all day to try to get to the places with the least line up time. The Disney app is great for letting you know the line times. Food in park is pretty poor as is available seating in restaurants...or lack of.  I'd say this was an ""okay"" Disneyland. People pushing a lot and say good bye to social distancing especially when lining up for the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. The personal space thing is something to navigate here.  Kids peeing through the fence in the line-ups (parents were there) wasn't a good thing."
15,2.0,Feb 2021,"Tianjin, China ",When profits are the magic,"We have moved back to China, now living in Shanghai after many years in the north.Went to Disneyland with the kids (8 and 6 years old) a well as my wife’s sister and dad.While we are quite experienced to crowds, Disneyland goes the little extra yard to ensure the full experience of waiting in lines, being pushed, wasting time and at the same time feeling that the whole thing is setup with only one purpose, namely, to get the last RMB out of your pockets before you leave.It was to be honest not a very pleasant trip and while my wife and I fast agreed that now we have visited this place once and sworn never to come back, it was more surprising that the kids during the day also started to complain. My wiffe’s dad? He left at 6:30 pm as he could not stand it anymore (old grumpy man! :-))The good•	Overall clean and nice environment•	Some parts of the park were not too overcrowded (comparing to Chinese standards) so walking around between the different worlds was manageable.•	While we did not try very many rides due to waiting in-line, the TRON Lightcycle Power Run was fun (if you can absorb the 50 min wait and further 20 min wait due to a break down)•	The fireworks/light show was impressive (if you can absorb the wait time and the pushing and shoving)•	Easy to get to, Shanghai Subway runs to the door.The bad•	Pricing. It is obviously not cheap. Please note that the price anchor in China for such things are set high so you will have to pay, which we expected, but again Disneyland just goes that little extra yard to ensure your pockets are completely swiped when you are gone. Entrance price, while not dirt cheap was not really excessive (we paid RMBB 499/adults, 399/children which is ok), however they go to great length to ensure you end up paying extras.•	Food, you must buy food and drinks inside. They have a security check before ticket purchase with the aim to swipe foods from those who brings it (we did not). It adds an extra 30-40 minutes wait-in-line to the experience and we saw quite a few that god food confiscated…my bad feelings started just there. Inside prices are excessive, particular when comparing to standard Chinese prices which on food are low. I will not do a full price list of horrors here, but let me put it this way – I originate from Scandinavia which is by most people (and by facts) considered expensive. In Disneyland their corndog/hotdog on stick like thing was priced with a +100% premium of what a hotdog runs me back in Denmark…so be warned!•	Stores and restaurants are all over and take up a considerably part of the part, in fact in hindsight there are actually only a few attractions given the size of the complex and not lest given the number of visitors they admit in.•	Which leads me the next profit maximizing item, the “jump the line pass”. Having assured that all fun rides are cramped, Disneyland has studied the book “The confessions of the Pricing man” on how to ripe the benefits of this in setting prices that allows you to skip the lines they created. After we arrived and discovered the waiting times for the rides we briefly considered buying one of the skip-the-line passes, but they ran at RMB 1,000 per person (2x adult entrance fee, 2½x children entrance fee) and could maximum be used 8 times! (that is an extra RMB 125 per ride). To be fair they had a whole price range for various skip-the-line passes with allowance for fewer rides, but the price per ride of these were same (actually slightly higher). You come to the suspicion (extremely fast) that it is all a well/evil planned profit maximizing scheme.The uglyWhile everyone that lives in, have lived in or just have been to China knows, crowds are plenty and all over, and this is an integrated part of live, planning and society setup. So having large crowds in Disneyland was be no means any surprise.However, it seemed to have surprised the planners as the number of attractions and particularly the capacity of these by no means matched the number of people let into the park at once.We arrived when the park opened, admittedly go were not in until at least 50 minutes after due to the food swiping exercise at the entrance, but on the advice of my wife’s sister we headed straight to the Soaring over the Horizon ride only to discover that the waiting time was….3 hours! (to be honest I though they were playing me a joke, but no). They had a standby pass system on the app which allows to the reserve time for waiting later…it does not allow you to arrive at a certain time and then avoid waiting. But that system suffered under crowd pressure as well. I managed to make one booking (for myself) but once I tried to add my wife, children, wife’s sister no more time slots were available…and that was that! (not even mentioning since we were six incl. my wife’s dad and the system only allowed groups up to five it was a bit useless for us)After the initially frustrations we then decided to get the best out of the day and try as many rides as we could. We tried the Roaring Rapids (60 mins wait), the Dwarfs mining Train (45 min wait), Rex Riders (90 min wait), TRON power race (50 mins wait + 20 mins break down wait) and the Pirates of the Caribbean Battle (45 min wait) plus my children tried the Dumpo ride, the shipwreck, saw a couple of the characters standing within fenced areas and the youngest also went to the sign along with Elsa/Frozen while the oldest was doing the TRON race. Particularly the Rex Riders was a complete joke. It had a capacity of 20! Low and behold! I guess the person coming up with that idea have never been to China before, at least he did not coordinated with the guy planning for how many to let in on any given day. We also decided to see the 8pm fireworks/lightshow and was advised to be there no later than 7pm if the children should have a chance to see it. We ended up waiting 1 hour and 15 minutes for the experience and as time passed more and more people showed up ending in constant pushing, shoving and being in constant physical contract with at least the nearest 3-4 people around you (Ironically the recorded announcer was every 15 minutes welcoming people to the event and telling them to keep social distancing and not blocking other people view…yeah right, maybe if you let 10,000 less people in it would be possible). The had reserved areas which had no people but these were for the people selling snacks, obviously! The really scaring part of the visit came when the show ended as the masses then started to leave. We we quickly decided to carry both children on held each other’s cloth not to lose each other in the black sea of people. It was insane (even for Chinese standards) one step in the wrong direction and we would not have found each other again. So flowing with the masses we (luckily) had to go the exit and the metro station because that was where the masses few to. To think this is a place for children!We came to the place around 8:40 am and left around 8:30pm. A full 12 hours, I tried 4 rides, my children maybe 6 maybe 7, we ate once while sitting, we ate a bit while walking, we saw the parade and besides walking from place to place we spent the rest of the time waiting in line.So be warned, it is a multi-billion dollar brand and by this alone they will attract enough visitors but the experience was noting close to magic, unless it is magic to wait in endless lines and get pushed and shoved.I ranked it, very generously, two starts, due to the parts mentioned under “the good”, but price and value experience does simply not match up. As a benchmark we in the summer had visited both Tivoli Gardens and Bakken amusement parks in Copenhagen, which are both high recommendable. Here the children tried rides all the time (at Bakken my oldest and I managed to run out of rides on the old wooden roller coaster on our access pass, which meant 10 rides on that ride alone). All within the same time spend and at total price that was half to a third of what we spent at Disneyland and with a much cozier atmosphere. The final curiosum is that Walt Disney actually build his Disneyland based on the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen after he had visited the park back in the 50s. His successors have failed miserably with that task in Shanghai."
16,5.0,Jan 2021,Cheongju ,A Fun Day,"Not much to say that hasn't already been said here, but if you're considering going around this time, definitely do it! We visited on January 6th (a Wednesday) and did not need to wait for a single ride! There are quite a few shows to watch throughout the day and quite a few good rides for adults. You can't miss TRON! If you aren't sure whether you'd like to visit or not, you can download the app now to monitor the wait times around the time you plan to visit. From our experience keeping an eye on the waiting times in the app before our trip:If you go during a more busy time of the year, I recommend getting there before the park opens and running straight to Soaring over the Horizon first as it seems to always have the longest wait time. The lines seemed to dwindle down at the very end of the day (after 6:30 pm), as well, if you can save your energy until then."
17,2.0,Nov 2020,"Beijing, China ","You can go, but do not let the attitude of the service people bother you.","I have been there once before and wanted to take my husband there. I wanted to try out the subway. The subway was easy and fast. Not too hard to find the right gate to get out. Signs were not the best but one can ask and figure it out.My disappointment was at the check point of the park, three "" Happy Host""s were not knowledgeable and unfriendly, they were not happy and not helpful and had no clue how to help, very disappointed for a fun place like this.They did not direct us to the right direction, they simply disappeared. We went around to look for the right gate to enter for a while.  They re rounted ppl due to Covid and did not bother to direct the guests.Same experice with the ticket counter lady, the gate employees, no one was happy, no professional smile,  not to mention being cheerful. sad to see.  And not helpful. They are just not happy to see the guests.The cleaning lady at the Treasure was helpful thoguh, I appreciate that.I had fun dispite this, because the Covid, less ppl at the park, less wait, much faster for the lines. Ate at the Cheesecake Factry, that was nice and noted the ppl also are not very friendly."
18,4.0,Dec 2019,"London, UK ",Magical day,"We had a magical time at Shanghai Disney. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to feel like a kid again or have a great time with their loved ones.We bought the fast passes which was so worth the money being a group of 9 people it really helped us get the most out of our day.The staff were friendly and the premises/toilets clean.The only problem for us was that the stories/instructions for rides were all in Chinese- they should add in the English translation.All in all a great day was had, not even the rain stopped us!"
19,4.0,Sep 2020,"Bangkok, Thailand ",Never  disappoints,"Good place to visit especially for couples and families. Various different activities compared to Hong Kong Disneyland and Los Angeles Disneyland.  A fun place to be  to spend the whole day. The place is very far from the city so it's better to go early.  A very important advise is to choose a weekday and a day where not many people would show up or else you would wait for hours just to enjoy 1 ride.  Comfortable clothes and shoes are important as the place is huge.  Don't carry any glassware,  food as they will ask you to store it in their locker.  Well compared to Hong Kong Disneyland and the one in Los Angeles the customer service is not great.  Staff don't smile and looks very serious whereas in other Disneyland properties all the Disney staff are smiling and dancing.  "
20,5.0,Dec 2019,"Beijing, China ",Great time. ,"Really enjoyed Disney in Shanghai.  Been to the one in Florida too,  they are on par.  Well organized and controlled.  The obvious crowds but you never feel crowded.  Transport easy to and fro. Very clean as always.  Nice rides,  especially Tron and Pirates of the Caribbean. "
21,5.0,Dec 2019,"Shenzhen, China ",Funfilled & unforgettable Disney Experience,Beautifully constructed with amazing and thrilled rides......unforgettable Disney experience need 2-3 days to visit and experience best weather to visit is WINTERS
22,5.0,Aug 2019,"Perth, Australia ",I would go  everyday if I could,"What an amazing experience. While visiting the park, we stayed at Toy Story Hotel who were great in giving us advice on how the park operates as far as early entry, fast pass, and so on. We spent some time the day before visiting the park looking around Downtown Disney, and getting a bit of a lay of the land, which helped us over the following days. On our first day in the park, the weather turned bad, as unbeknownst to us there was a typhoon on the way. This meant the large crowds all rushed to spots for protection, which became frustrating. The bad weather forced the closure of many of the rides. The park emptied out, which meant lines that were normally an hour wait were 10 minutes or less, so we pushed on through and took the weather as part of our Disney experience. Within the park there was always a cast member no too far away to help out, and all had a good understanding of English. Due to the typhoon that hit Shanghai, the park was closed for the day that was to be our second day at the park, but the staff transferred all of our fast passes  and entry, and we had no obstacles getting into the park and enjoying it again the following day which was a hidden blessing as the crowds had dwindled down quite a bit. Too many individual highlights to list, but Soaring Over the Horizon, Pirates Of The Caribbean, and Seven Dwarfs Mine Train were right up there.  I would definitely visit again if i was able to, and would recommend it to anyone, of any age"
23,5.0,Jul 2019,"Phoenix, AZ ",The castle is amazing,"We purchased our tickets for Disneyland via Klook for a discounted rate around 75 USD each for peak times. For any international visitors you need to have your passport verified as they scan you in. There are plenty of areas to hangout and get photos of and around the castle as opposed to in Disneyland in Anaheim. However, we didn’t really find many cast members that day who take pictures or are around if you have questions. We love to eat so we enjoyed the different foods. We would recommend getting the Donald Waffle and cherry blossoms ice cream, checking out the pastries at Remy’s cafe, trying a barbecue turkey leg near pirates, and the food court in Pinocchio village. Of the rides we would suggest going on Pirates and Tron. We also highly suggest checking out the Tarzan show which is unlike any other Disney show. Because there aren’t many rides at the park the lines are long. They offer traditional fast passes but they sell out very quickly. The day we went all fastpasses for all rides were gone by 1PM. After that you can purchase fastpasses per ride or buy a pack for a handful of rides. On average each fastpass will cost around 10 USD. Lastly, the park unfortunately closes early so they have their main nightly show at 8:30PM and close the park at that time. This show much like the rides incorporates a lot of augmented reality and lights as opposed to a traditional firework show but we really enjoyed the change. For our first Disney experience outside of the US we had a great time and can’t wait to see other parks!- @wanderingwithustwo"
24,5.0,May 2020,N/A,Nice to be back!,"This is our first time back since COVID-19. The park was closed for more than 3 months. Local authorities have imposed a 30% capacity limitation for social distancing reasons. As such, you must first book a slot ahead of your arrival. Else, you will be politely turned away at the door as they are likely to have issued out all the tickets before the day itself.Despite the restrictions, the park still felt pretty crowded (30% would equate to 12,000 people). There are clear markings on the floor to encourage social distancing. Their staff are also at hand to remind visitors to keep a safe distance from each other.All in all, it’s nice to be able to be on the happiest place on earth despite COVID-19."
25,5.0,Dec 2019,"Singapore, Singapore ",happiest place in Asia,The world's happy place. The price from Viator  is cheaper than the actual counter. It is very convinient to book on the spot as well. You can bring food in. Better than Hong Kong Disneyland. Go in later so you can spend more time until the closing hour fireworks. Thabk you for the good price. Really appreciate the effort to secure good rates. You will need to bring your passport to key in for the tickets.
26,5.0,Dec 2019,"Metro Manila, Philippines ",A Great One Day Experience,"Contrary to much attention the park received from international media, I personally did not have any negative experience with other park visitors, especially from locals. There wasn't any cutting in line or ""rude"" behavior. There was one man smoking in a non-smoking area, though. A cast member immediately asked him to dispose of his cigarette .Pros:- Unique rides and Disney park experience- Rides are fun and diverse enough for varying interests- Interesting food options- Beautiful castle- Can converse with most staff in English- Park is large, but can be explored in one day- Free all-day wifi throughout the parkCons- As usual with Disney parks, food and merchandise are very expensiveTips- Downloading the Shanghai Disneyland app on your phone prior to your visit is a MUST. Helped us get around the park and plan out which rides we would do at specific times (the app shows the waiting time for all rides and shows in real-time and you can also use it to get your free fast passes).- GET FAST PASSES! Use the app to get them, especially for high-demand rides. - The Tron ride is a must-try. - There is an area just outside the park (Still part of the Disney property) with many shops and restaurants. You may find good cheaper options for dining here. Re-entry into the park is allowed! Just don't lose your ticket."
27,5.0,Apr 2019,"Port Saint Lucie, FL, ",Huge Castle!,"Shanghai Disneyland was the “anchor” for our trip to Shanghai and we had a great day.  We visited not long after the Chinese New Year, and made sure we went on a weekday to avoid the crowds.  Because we only had one day at the park and we wanted to maximize our time, we purchased Concierge Services which gave us access to a number of rides without having to wait in line.  We missed that we needed to enter via the Disney Grand Theater, which is in Disneytown.  We ended up in a somewhat long queue to enter the park and then had to exit to get our special tickets at the theater as the entrance to the theater within the park was not open.  The park was not crowded the day we went, so we didn’t really need the special ride access, but it also gave us access to special viewing areas for the parade and fireworks/light show.  Access to those areas was great, and they enforced access!  We rode Tron twice, and I recommend riding at night if you can.  The castle is huge and you can go up in it. They have some rides that are the same as in the US parks, and some different ones.  We noticed a lot of space for expansion and the manager of the concierge lounge at our hotel told us there are plans to build three more parks, which would make Shanghai Disneyland larger than Walt Disney World!We took a taxi from our hotel and the doorman told the driver where we wanted to go, and she got us there, but had to stop several times to ask for directions to the drop off area.  I had a card from our hotel with the address written in Chinese so we could give to a taxi driver on our return.

28,5.0,Apr 2019,"Mexico City, Mexico, ",Happiest place on earth,"Amazing syncretism between the Disney experience and the East, specifically the chinese culture. Here you will notice many many differences compared to other parks, but at the same time, everything is familiar.I don't speak Mandarin and it can be frustrating or challenging at some times, since not many things are in English... but it adds an exotic touch to your visit. By far, is the best Disney ever built. Tomorrowland is out of this world."

We got on it multiple times because we don’t have that ride in the U.S. I love the fact that Shanghai Disney gives a fast pass every hour for different rides. We enjoyed our time. I would go back during warmer weather.
30,4.0,Dec 2019,"Java, Indonesia ",One day to spend...,"First of all, try to be here before their opening time at 9 to avoid long queue. I can't imagine if it's summer. I went with my kids in winter, less crowds, BUT least I expected, it was a bit of long queue on 25th Dec since it is a holiday in Shanghai. But still manageable. Get the map online to help u navigate the area. All in Chinese language. Expect long queue in main attractions like the tron, seven dwarf, slinky dog. Tron is the longest I waited for 1.5-2 hour as well as the seven dwarfs. Bring raincoats, umbrella if u go in winter. Occasionally there will be light showers. Jack sparrows, Peter pan, Winnie the Pooh, are great. There are restaurant, souvenirs shops, rest room. Quite disappointed with some sellers try to sell fake Disney souvenirs on the way out. Overall it's great time to spend with kids& family. My kids had a blast day. Tips: bring snacks/foods, so u can eat it while on long queue. This enables u to enjoy almost all rides. Winter is less crowds, but avoid on Christmas day 25th."

36,5.0,Oct 2019,"Luton, UK ",Amazing experience ,"Firstly, you need to understand that if you are going to almost any theme park it will generally be very busy. Usually I always expect Disney to be busier and this was no exception, would I have liked it to be quieter? Of course! But who wouldn’t? The park itself is very big but seems to be pretty well spread out which may just be to give more freedom for new rides in the future. The rides were amazing especially those which are not currently at any other park e.g. Tron. One of my favourite rides was the Voyage to the Crystal grotto which I would recommend riding twice as a minimum (day and night). Our overall experience was great there were a couple of things which we noticed which aren’t necessarily the parks fault. 1) vegetarian food. Within the park itself the options are limited, we walked from restaurant to restaurant to try and find a vegetarian meal to be told they didn’t have any in at the moment and to try another restaurant, unfortunately even Disneytown didn’t have options, aside from Bread Kitchen which ended up saving myself in particular. I did have the vegetarian burger meal from the stargazer grill which was okay but not great, possibly personal tastes however. 2) general etiquette - people visiting the park had no issue trying to cut queues and a few times we witnessed parents encouraging their children to go to the toilet in a plant when the toilets were a couple of feet away, this is likely cultural.I would recommend getting to the park early, making sure you have the app downloaded and passes scanned in to get your fast passes booked as we found these were gone by around midday. Make sure you take a camera to get pictures of all the little details dotted around the park. The fireworks/projection show on the castle is a must but you need to get in front of the castle at least 30-60 minutes before as people start getting their spots early. Shanghai Disney offer a “Passport” which you can purchase and then go area by area to collect stamps, although aimed at children I am 26 and enjoyed doing it, once you have collected all the stamps you can then take this to the specified shop on Mickey avenue and you get a prize (mine was a Tron Pen) and keep the passport with your completion stamp which just makes for a cute memento from the trip. We did find that most of the stamp machines were broken however if you went into the closest shop they had manual stamps. The only thing we didn’t see much of was character meet and greets dotted around which from Florida, Paris and Hong Kong these tended to be initially at the entrance and then in specified areas of the park.Do not let a few reviews stating the obvious of the park being busy put you off as we found it enjoyable despite the crowds. A trip to Disney is always a good idea!"
37,5.0,Jan 2020,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ",Disney Shanghai,"Super! Will come again. First time to Disney land, wonderful experience for kid n family. Game is super but need to take long time for one game. Food was a.bit expensive but was nice"
38,3.0,Jan 2020,N/A,Not the best not the worst ,"The park overall is beautiful and well played out. However there are some small things that could be improved. In order to make full use of the park you will need to download the disney app and connect to the wifi. This way you can use the map to plan your route around and buy fast pass tickets. Unfortunately we found the wifi very difficult to access not having a chinese number and was unable to access all these features. The rides vary in quality. The pirates of the Caribbean was one of the best experiences I've had in a park before I was completely blown away by it. I also really enjoyed the tron attraction too, which is the fastest attraction disney offers. However the final attraction we did soaring over the horizon was terrible. We started off by waiting outside in the rain with no cover to then have to line up around 2 hours for the attraction damp. You can see everyone struggling and people sitting on the floor because their legs and feet are hurting. When we finally got to the attraction there was only english subtitles for the safety instructions not the whole story of what the attraction was for (if they could subtitle the H&S I dont see why they couldn't the rest of the video)so we didnt really know what was going on. Then whilst on the attraction the whole left side of the screen was blurry and it just felt a shame to have waited such a long time for this attraction. If youd like to get fast passes doe this I would reccomend buying them in advance as they sell out very early on. I have previously been to universal and found all the staff to get into character really well and really sell the belief you're in the world of Harry Potter ect however the staff here didnt have that same magical feel. The lights show on the castle at the end of the night was a MUST DO!. It was completely mesmorising seeing the lights and fireworks over the castle. It's worth getting to the castle at least 30 mins before the show starts as the crowds of people will stand and wait before the show to get the best view. I think the park is worth seeing as it's not expensive for tickets however I compared the whole day to universal and completely favoured universal as a day out. "
39,4.0,Jan 2020,"East London, South Africa ",Always Magical,"As expected a great show from Disney. Really always a magical experience, but the rides are not extreme, except the TRON ride. Very unique. So if it’s rides you want, go to another park, but if you want  to be transported to another world, this is the place. Watch the shows, the parades, the exhibitions AND the faces of the children when they see magic come alive!!"

Compared with the older generations of Disney resorts, this is a very well thought through place. Modernised yet retaining the traditional Disney charms. You need a full day to cover the entire theme part.I like the many restaurants serving Asian fare.  Areas that I feel could be improved. #1. The appearance schedule of Disney characters could be clearly publized.  #2. Some elevated grounds could be created specially to facilitate viewing by the kids. #3. The viewing terrace for performance in front of the castle could be extended especially during the fireworks when all other attractions are closed or near closing."

44,2.0,Dec 2019,"Leeds, UK ",Third Visit to Shanghai Disneyland,"I have been to almost every Disney resort around the world (Florida, California, Hong Kong, Paris and now Shanghai) various times, so I know what the standard usually is and should be. They have definitely tried to replicate it here, however the park is tiny (it claims to be the biggest and I am really not sure how? it can be walked around completely in 20-30 mins!) with very few thrill rides. The park is definitely aimed at young children as there are only 2 big rides. We went on 23rd Dec, an off peak Monday and every ride had a huge queue (maximum 210 minutes) and they also closed down the single rider queues as it was so busy. We were there all day and only managed to get on about 3 rides. By lunchtime all fast passes had finished distributing. The third time I went, not only were the park ride queues much longer, but also queues in general, even just to get into the park it took half an hour at least. The park also closed so much earlier than other disneylands i have been to, however, any longer than 4-5 hours here does start to feel like a drag.Luckily I live here so I didn't take too much trouble to travel here, but if I had come here from overseas or even from another Chinese province I would be very disheartened. The Disneytown is very nice to walk around and have a meal at though."
45,1.0,Dec 2019,N/A,Never again!! Go Tokyo or other disneyland than this,"People are just pushing and cutting on queues.  The staff just didn't bother to manage the crazy crowd.

46,4.0,Dec 2019,"Singapore, Singapore ",Still magical but flawed,"Could feel the effort and thought put into the design of the theme park to give a sense of wonder and joy to visitors. We liked the gift shops which were very cute. The Pirates of the Caribbean show was very enjoyable if a little confusing. The Frozen sing-along show was nice enough, but felt somewhat lacking and there was a noticeable lack of kids singing along.  Were the kids in the audience bored like us? It felt like there was a lot of walking between rides and many restaurants and eateries to fill those spaces, and we thought perhaps this was to make up for the crowd, which was larger than most other theme parks we've been to, even in winter.There's a terrible design issue which I felt I had to point out. Some of the toilets had open smoking areas right outside them, and people had to go through the smoking crowd to use them. One time my wife went to the toilet and while I was filling our bottles at a water dispenser I had to endure the smoke from about one (or three) dozen smokers who were spread out around the toilet entrance."
47,2.0,Jan 2020,N/A,Not the greatest,This Disney simply needs more rides. Having been to all but Tokyo this park was a let down. We aimed for a quieter period but still the waits were near 3 hours on popular attractions. The day can be summed up when my daughter waited 16 minutes in line to order a pretzel. It might be a magical place but this park needs a rethink
48,5.0,Dec 2019,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ",Happiest Place on Earth!,"We pre-booked our tickets and entering Disneyland was not a hassle at all. We booked a two day admission. The first day was gloomy and drizzly but all the rides were open. The skies cleared up after awhile. You see less crowds in December and all of us got to ride our favourites multiple times. No need for fastpass. Best rides are Tron (awesome but scary as reviewed by my sons), Pirates of the Caribbean, Roaring Rapids (you'll get splashed, so wear a raincoat), Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Pan's Flight and the Challenge Trails."
49,4.0,Nov 2019,"Christchurch, New Zealand ",Long queues,I went early and had an early entry pass too. Quite a rigmarole to get in with having to show passport and then verified at another point just through the gates. Went straight to the Tron ride to get in quick. After that long queues and using the app wasn't that helpful to book your fastpass. Disappointing eateries.
50,1.0,Dec 2019,N/A,"I hope you like selfies. Even if you don't, you'll be in one!","To be blunt, there is no magic to this place.The first thing you'll notice after getting through the entrance is that people will actively queue up 3 lines deep just to take photos with anyone in costume. Oh, and there are no costumed characters openly walking around the park interacting with visitors. That would be a death sentence.The rides are a pain in the ass. All the good adventure rides will require a mininum 60 minute wait with some getting to 120 mins usually after 12pm. If you don't like that, you can book a fastpass on the disney app. Problem is, those fastpasses only work for evening times, usually just before the park actually closes. Then again, you can bypass all of this by paying an extra $100+ USD for a premiere pass (per person) which only allows you to cut lines once for 8 specified rides. Apart from that, the thing that pissed me off the most here are the endless selfies that the locals all seem hellbent on doing. You'll realise after walking in the park for a bit that the locals just want to take photos. That's it. They're not actually enjoying being there. They just enjoy taking selfies. You go to any gift store and they're all piled there, taking selfies and then running off without buying anything. I saw selfies being made in front of restaurant signs, park benches, popcorn stalls, trees, etc. The girls all like doing the same stupid poses in front of any attraction. The funniest thing is most of them don't smile with their mouths open because they all have bad teeth. Anyway, I've had enough. I had an awful experience and left the park after 3 hours of walking. I don't care if you go or not go. Just be prepared for all the endless selfies."

Queue was well managed and we got into the park in no time. It’s a large park compared to Hong Kong Disneyland. The Shanghai Disney Land smartphone app helped us navigate and see the queue times for each attraction. Would suggest going to the park for two days if you want to experience every ride especially during peak days as certain queues can span over 2hrs. Really enjoyed watching the stage show Eye Of The Storm. As it was raining, the parade was disappointing as it was short with only two floats and all the characters stayed on the floats. "
54,4.0,Dec 2019,"Singapore, Singapore ","Big sized park, interesting popcorns","Good sized park with not as much rides compared to other Disneylands. There’s only 1 daytime parade, but the castle stage show and the light show on castle is good. Even though park is big, you still need to be early to get a good viewing spot.You must download the app to make full use of the experience. Fast pass can be obtained through the app, and popular rides’ fast pass can be gone by early morning due to early park entries by Disney Hotels guests.Must rides are Pirates, Tron, followed by Soaring and Snow White Mine Train (is a remake of Thunder Mountain, with smoother ride). Winnie the Pooh will be a let down if you have done the one in Tokyo.Character photo taking is serious business there and will take a long time. Each party can take multiple poses and individual photos with the characters, so be prepared to wait even if the queue looks short.A good idea to buy a PhotoPass. The official photographers do a good job and even suggest how to pose. You can also get good pics of the meet and greets and rides you take."
55,2.0,Dec 2019,N/A,Selfie-land not Disneyland,"We’ve been to Disneyland in other countries , this one is not Disneyland it is selfie-land. There’s no Disney magic due to the sheer number of people taking selfies at every angle every square footage of this place- posing in front of a bin, in front of the toilet block , tree , fence, the ground, the railing... it’s no wonder the characters can’t roam around like in other Disneylands, they will be mobbed. Even in December which is low tourist season the rides still take 60-120 mins to queue with fast passes only available for after 5pm - once you make it in the queues and get on a ride your view is obscured by people leaning out with selfie sticks to take their own ride selfies. I was shocked they could hold those selfie sticks even on the faster rides.  The gift shop is worse as people push and shove - not to buy things- but to pose and take selfies with the Disney toys. Save your money , go have a nice meal somewhere or if you really need to go to Disneyland hop over to Hong Kong Disneyland."

The lady at the tourist info desk said this should cost 50 yuan but it cost 100 on the way out. The driver on the way back tried to charge us almost 600 yuan which ended up in a heated argument so a word of warning here. The park itself feels large when compared to other Disney parks but the attractions are spread out. We went on a rainy Saturday and managed almost every ride in about 5 hours thanks to the app and the fast pass system. Connect to the WiFi and scan your tickets as soon as you have them to get started. Highlights for us were the Tron lightcycles and Pirates of the Caribbean which has had a significant upgrade from it’s US counterpart. Order your tickets online in advance for coupons for free food.

58,5.0,Dec 2019,"Singapore, Singapore ",Great Time to Come in December,"We were at Disneyland for two days and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Seems like a good time to come if you do not mind the mild cold because the queues are short. Went on a Thursday and the queue for the rides were only 5-10 minutes, with the exception of Tron, Seven Dwarves and Soaring Over the Horizon. Even managed to get three fast passes! Went again on a Friday and queues were significantly longer, with queues at Soaring at about two hours. My recommendation is to come Monday to Thursday to maximise the number of rides. Overall, December seems like a good time to come as it is not the school holidays. There is no need for VIP tours or premier access passes for sure during this period.Compared the last time I was here in 2017, the security checks were very fast and staff were well-trained and polite. English proficiency seems to have improved as well. There were many previous reviews about queue-cutting behaviour - but they are far and few between during our two days here.Had several meals at Disneytown - Blue Frog, Ippudo, Wolfgang Puck - and they were all rather affordable. I think they are of much better value and quality compared to the prices in the park itself.Will definitely be back again!"

I’ve forgotten what it was called but the Marvel themed diner next to the Tron ride had a veggie burger with a green bun. Again, unsure but i believe it was vegan, it was very hard to understand due to the very little english the staff spoke. The bun was very dry and the burger was lacking sauce. The pattie was like a beyond burger crossed with a veggie pattie has it had diced veggies throughout. it was about $20 AUD so quite expensive ! it also came with chips and a free icey pole and drink. wouldn’t normally recommend it but they isn’t really another option :’(i did see fruit cups in a few of the themed restaurants.

We finished all the rides (I’m not kidding) and walking around the park by 4.30pm (we started at 8.30am and no lunch). Very limited food options/mostly local food.

Tonight is the last night and we attended Beauty and the Beast musical, hoping to end off the holidays with beautiful memories for the children. Regrettably, during the first half of the musical, my daughter had asked me for some stickers and we were told to keep quiet very abruptly by a Disney staff. He had told us to keep her quiet. Twice. As a result, my daughter was frightened and we left during intermission. For info, my mother who was seated 2 seats away, did not hear my daughter’s sticker requests. Thus, I am not sure why we were picked at, out of all the other Chinese families with children who were also speaking throughout the musical.Disneyland is a family oriented venue and Beauty and the Beast is a family friendly musical, hence, children talking should be expected. Our family spends holidays at Disneyland throughout the world and stay at Disney properties. I regret having spent my last evening at Shanghai attending this musical.

76,4.0,Nov 2019,"Sacramento, CA ",Huge and beautiful but lacking rides ,"I was worried that my 1 day here wasn’t enough, but we found ourselves with a few hours to spare. Despite the long lines, although I think it was slow that day, the lack of substantial rides made it a pretty quick day, but I wasn’t about to leave without watching the whole light show! The castle was huge and pink, go to the pirate show even if you don’t understand Chinese, it is fun. The ropes course is harder than you think it will be. Tron is the best ride they have, i was disappointed that some of the other new rides at older parks were there. "
77,1.0,Nov 2019,"Singapore, Singapore ",Very disappointed experience ,"Don't even buy disneyland tickets from their office site or over their hotel counter! I'm a hotel guest at the toy story hotel, without checking the price, we bought 4 Disneyland tix, 2 adults and 2 kids at the hotel. After that then I realised that the price is so much more expensive than klook, the price difference is abt sgd50 or 250rmb. We went back to them to asked for an refund but was rejected, they stated that tix are not refundable. My tix was bought less than 2hrs and I was told that there is no refund. I don't think it is fair. Didn't they know abt lemon law? Agree that we have fault in this but the price difference simply way too huge. "
78,4.0,Nov 2019,"Chapin, SC, ",Chinese Disney,Similar to Disneyland and Disneyworld with many classic rides and a few unique ones.  Love Tron and the Alice in Wonderland maze.  Get an early pass to beat the crowds.  Also look for single ride lines and fast pass.  Food at adjacent Disneytown is good with sit down service.
79,1.0,Sep 2019,N/A,"Poor, rude customer service from Steven at Guest Relations/Customer Service/City Hall Ruined our Experience","Let me preface this by saying that I have visited every Disney park in the world, and have worked for Disney in their theme parks for multiple years both in France and in the USA.We stayed at the Toy Story Hotel. We had booked to stay onsite partially because we were offered one extra hotel Fastpasss per day per person which we thought would be valuable, as well as the early entry.Day 1 - All went pretty well, was a weekday, the rides were great, weather was great, I even had a chinese guy want to practice his english with me in one of the queues.  Queues were manageable with fastpass but actually were much longer than I thought they would be. Early entry also was a great bonus for being at the hotels. However, anytime that it came to a big show event of the day, this is when the locals really came into their own - during the parade there were selfie sticks practically hitting the performers, people have no concept or personal space, and there was A LOT of pushing and shoving - very poor crowd behaviour, but also poor that the CM did not do anything about the selfie sticks ruining everyones views (these are supposedly banned at all disney parks). On the note of rides: pirates and tron were incredible, fantasyland is very well thought out and huge, and the ropes courses were fantastic. Staff spoke very, very little english but were more than happy to help. Prices for park tickets and food, and drinks were cheap by western Disney park standards (one bottle of water is £1 equivalent). Oddly there were pepsi products, not coke. The management of the fireworks was a shambles and there were so many trees in the hub area that very few areas had a clear line of sight. We ended up all the way at the back of the hub with a poor view between two trees despite being ready for the fireworks over an hour before.Day 2 - This was a weekend day, and immediately from entering the park it was clear it was much, much busier. Within an hour of opening there were no fastpasses for anything. Queues were all 90-150 for the headline rides. Even pirates which has a huge capacity was a 45 minute wait. After making the most of the first hour of the park, it became clear that today was the day to use our hotel fastpass. And this is where the problems all started.When we checked in at the hotel and asked about the fastpass, we were told that the fastpass wasn't included in our room. As it was not set to be too busy, we didn't worry too much and thought we could go to city hall in the park if we ever needed them. Fast-forward to day 2 and i suggested we should go to guest relations and see if they could help us get our fastpass that was advertised as being included with hotel rooms. The first lady we spoke to explained that this was not included in our ticket but could not explain why. After 15 minutes of dealing with her, her calling our hotel, checking our tickets and more, we asked to speak to a manager or a team leader. She said 'We are all equal here' , we asked for a complaint form and she said 'We don't have'. She was clearly trying to get rid of us, and after about 5 more minutes of convincing her we weren't moving, she finally got someone else to come and speak to us. She did however try and sell us the premium fastpass, so clearly they had fastpass availability for sale.After explaining the situation to this manager/team leader, she reiterated the same thing. Then a character whose 'English name' was 'Steven' got involved out of nowhere. It had now been 30 minutes of us trying to get this sorted. The two ladies were polite but couldn't help; Steven however was incredibly rude and argumentative and made us go on the website and show him where this was written. He was shocked to see we were right.Instead of trying to resolve the situation, by issuing us a fastpass for a ride (which literally costs the park nothing to give out), Steven then went into a 30+ page terms and conditions part of the website which had different wording to the hotel main page - this said that the park tickets and hotel had to be purchased together to get the free hotel fasptss, or we could buy the tickets at the hotel. We explained that this was not clear from the booking page, and that it is impossible to book park tickets until 30 days before the travel date - at that point hotels are sold out and if they are not, we couldn't be expected to plan a trip to china without a hotel booked. therefore, we argued that this is a scam as it is impossible to book the hotel and park tickets together and get this offer 30 days before. We had paid full price for the hotel and the park tickets on the official disney website so it is not like disney would have made more money from us if we'd booked both together (which as mentioned is impossible anyway).In the end we spent 50-60 minutes in the park. They took our passports and photographed them (necessary to get into the park), took our ticked and photographed them and in the end refused to help. I completely understand that we had not read the 30+ page T&Cs but the booking page very clearly offered us this free fastpass as a benefit, and then they refused to honour it. Even if it was our mistake, we were offered nothing for our trouble - as I say, a fastpass costs nothing to give out (!), these are digital, they were available as they tried to sell us one, and customer service's role is to help customers, not to argue with them and dispute the terms and condictions. Steven wanted to pick and fight and not help his customers. Having worked as a Cast Member, I know at DLP/DL/WDW/Tokyo Disney from first hand experience that the guest relations cast members have the power to make pretty much anything happen to improve a guests day - I have seen entire stays comped at Disneyland Paris, replacement strollers, merchandise and food at WDW (all which cost the company money) and yet here in Shanghai it seems that the customer service is non existent. A couple of unique rides will never make up for that (Tron is being cloned now anwyay!).This tarred the whole experience, and completely ruined our time here. The Walt Disney Company should be ashamed at how this Chinese company is treating and representing their brand."
80,4.0,Oct 2019,"Seattle, WA ",A Unique Experience,"Ive had an annual pass to Disneyland CA and been to Disney World multiple times so really went to because I had a morning to burn and mostly curious. It was significantly cheaper than any Disneys I have been to at $48 usd for the day and there were 20 min lines at most! The castle is more impressive and Tron is a blast, but overall there are much less attractions (I did the park in half a day) and just didn't quite have that magical feel the other parks do. Still fun though. Do if you have time and kids, but if you are pressed for time I would skip."
81,3.0,Nov 2019,N/A,Queing all day,"This is one of the latest Disneylands, so we expected really extraordinary attractions. While some lived up to the expectations, most did not. The few cool ones had a waiting time of over two hours (or even three), and the fast lane tickets are extremely pricy. I have visited a few Disneylands around the world, but never experienced this long waiting times. At some attractions the admission is poorly organise,d which makes waiting time much longer than necessary. We went on Monday, to avoid the peak days and yet it was awful. The only thing on the plus side is if you stay at a Disney Hotel, you get access an hour before general public and if you are lucky, you can do 3 attractions before the queus build up."
82,5.0,Oct 2019,"Antipolo City, Philippines ",Truly the happiest place on Earth,"Disneyland never fails to bring out the heart of the child of everyone.Location is very accessible and their online ticket purchasing and online guide is very commendable.Though it is understandable that all attractions and disneyland staff mostly only speak Chinese, you can still enjoy them. All shows are in Chinese so if you intend to watch, brace yourself to enjoy only the view but may be lost on the story (though they are still enjoyable).If you purchased the one day ticket only, it is recommended to go there as early as possible to enjoy the rides you want. Their app also is very useful to check the waiting time and schedule of each attraction, rides, or shows.Lastly, stay until closing to witness the finale.. a classic Disneyland trademark. It starts 8:30 and lasts for around 20 minutes."
83,5.0,Oct 2019,N/A,Disneyland is awesome !!!!!!!!,"Disneyland doesnt let you through security until 9am but there is a big queue from at least 8am. And they  do let you bring in food eventhough they say they dont, just no fruit . I saw lots of people bringing in there own food. I only brought in water . the food and drinks is quite expensive.rides - Pirates of the Caribbean is great, worth the waiting time. Soaring above the Horizon was a 50 minute wait but it was awesome. It certainkly made you feel like you were flying. The Seven dwarfs mine ridde was the first one we went to as last time it was a 1.5 hour wait but as it was our first ride, we got in at 9.15am, we didnt have to wait too long. TRON is a must do, we only got to do this once this time, last time we did it 3 times. The Buzz ride is interactive, you shoot at targets, we did this twice, i got a score of 900,000 compared to my 16 year old daughter who got 500,000, i rubbed it in that i beat her twice.Marvel is a good photo spot.We walked through the castle, lots of stairs.Toy story has a couple of good rides.Lots of great photos to be taken through out the park, night photos are greatWe were unable to stay for the light show as we were exhausted but i was told its great, so if you can stay for it."
84,5.0,Nov 2019,"Mexico City, Mexico ",AMAZING EXPERIENCE! ,"Is it worth going to Disneyland Shanghai?  The answer is undoubtedly: If you have time, do not miss it! But it is important to take into account several aspects.  My wife and I were very lucky to have had such a good experience at Disneyland Shanghai since we went in ultra low season (First week of November and on a weekday) which greatly favored the experience since we basically didn’t que up for more than 5 min in any of the attractions. The park itself is a beauty, it feels like it is super new and the technology is spectacular.  We took a taxi from Pudong to Disneyland at 7:45 AM and it cost us approx.  RMB 140 ($ 20 USD) and it took 45 mins to arrive.  When you arrive at the park it takes you another 15 mins walking to reach the first security line which took us about 1 hour to pass (between that they opened the park because we arrived a long time in advance and we passed).  Then, you get to a second row to have your tickets checked, that row still took 20 minutes.  You have to take into consideration in which country you are in and the education and customs they have.  Everyone in line wants to pass you, they push you and they want to take advantage as soon as they can.  Think about where you are and just let it go.As in all Disney parks, we bought the PhotoPass ($ 30 USD) to take pictures around the park but to our surprise, the points to take the photos is extremely limited, not like in Orlando that you have the chance to take thousands of photos around  from the park.  So I do not recommend buying the PhotoPass, but to buy the photos separately. The two outstanding games are undoubtedly TRON and Pirates of the Caribbean.  All the others are good but not as innovative and surprising as the other two mentioned before, that do surpass Universal Studios in Orlando and several Disney World games. One of the important aspects to consider is that it is an “authentically Disney, distinctively Chinese” park, so all the rides are in Chinese and the staff barely speaks English, so it is a bit complicated to communicate and ask for directions.  So it is very useful that someone from the group already brings Wi-Fi on their cellphone to be able to use the translator and facilitate the experience in every way. About the Wi-Fi inside the park, in order to have internet you need a Chinese number to get a message with a code and you can verify it.  Thing that we did not have one then we could not access even though it’s free.About the food: the options for Westerners are a bit reduced.  The best option is Mickey-shaped pizzas!  The duck and cheese are very good!  My wife arrived with the illusion of eating the famous churros and pretzels in the other parks around the United States.  The good news is that they have them, the bad news was they could not even be eaten since the taste is really different and they were ""pumpkin"" flavored. When leaving the park, going to DisneyTown, the first thing you see is a Cheescake Factory.  No doubt for us it would have been a better option to go out to eat and rest a little there, and return later to continue with the park. It is a very viable option too.In general, you can pay almost everything by card but it is advisable to also carry cash.Definitely a GREAT DAY at Disneyland Shanghai, it is worth going back, for sure!!"
85,5.0,Oct 2019,"Brisbane, Australia ",Magic of Disney never fails,"Disney Shanghai was the last Disney park for us to visit and it did not fail in any way. The park and gardens are beautiful and that’s before you even get to the gate . We purchased our tickets online which helps avoid queues to get in and entry was a breeze. Security was appropriate and very nice.So every Disney is slightly different with inflections to the host country and this park was no different. Main Street USA was not the same albeit some of the outlet stores were. The castle is magnificent and to scale and functioning with restaurants, it is breathtaking. Plenty of rides inthe various worlds with a new pirates of the Caribbean ride which was super and plenty for the whole family. Plenty of eating options and shopping. The fireworks and day and night shows are spectacular with the cast doing a great job.What’s to fault - nothing but be prepared to wait to get on the more popular rides no surprise. Really also enjoyed downtown Disney which offered more eating and shopping options which we enjoyed for dinner after the park closed. Thanks Disney and the wonderful cast"
86,4.0,Nov 2019,"Mango Hill, Australia, ",Happiest place on earth,"Shanghai Disneyland was awesome. We purchased our tickets on line so just had to cue for entry, you need to show your passport. The lines were very line with wait times displayed, we found that the wait time was less then they displayed. Pirates of the Caribbean was the best ride ever, well worth it, Tron was also very good. Food is very expensive like most theme park. Shops were plentiful with lots to choose from. We took snacks in our bag and just purchased water around the park. "
87,5.0,Oct 2019,"London, UK ",Excellent,"We visited Shanghai Disney on a weekday at the end of Oct. Although it wasn't during Chinese school holiday period nor a Chinese public holiday, there were still a lot of visitors.  We got there just after 7:15am and at least a couple of hundred visitors were already there. Once the gate was opened, we got in fairly quickly, as the security check is pretty basic nowadays - they just opened your bag and had a quick peek inside, then off you go. The second queue was to get the tickets you ordered beforehand.  Make sure you entered the correct passport numbers when booking tickets online, as the tickets will be printed at the ticket gate by staff searching passport numbers in the system or scanning Chinese ID cards, not the booking reference number.  We went straight to Soaring over the Horizon after finally entered the Shanghai Disneyland and there was hardly anybody. After we came out of the venue, the queue for Soaring over the Horizon started to build up and it remained the longest queue throughout the day - the APP showed 120mins most of the time. It was an interesting ride, but if you got there late, I wouldn't wasting 2 hrs for that. Best rides for us were Tron Lightcycle Power Run, Rex's Racer and Roaring Rapid. Buzz the Lightyear Planet Rescue is a laser shooting ride, also very interesting. We enjoyed the Challenge Trails at Camp Discovery as well, which was similar to Go Ape, but the course was not as long. We used the Shanghai Disney APP to check waiting times for rides and ended up riding the Tron 7 times, as we took advantage of the shorter queues during lunch and dinner times. The 3:30pm parade and the fireworks and light/music show in the evening were both enjoyable. The staff were all delightful and helpful. The whole venue was very clean, including toilets, which is rare in Mainland China. Water fountains were positioned outside toilets and easy to find.WIFI is available throughout the Disneyland, but you need to get a code sent by text to activate the free WIFI.  Not sure if it works with an oversea phone number. Foods were tasty, but expensive. I would recommend taking packed lunch to save time and money. Disney souvenirs were also expensive, which was very much expected.For rides that require storing your personal belongings, free storage facilities were available. We had a great time in Shanghai Disneyland and hope to return next year."
88,5.0,Sep 2019,"Scarborough, Australia ",Surprisingly Good (as long as you don’t go in the Holidays!),"We were lucky to be able to miss the peak period and holidays to have a surprisingly great time at Disney. Having come off a cruise from Shanghai we were quite concerned about how we would find the queue behaviour of the locals. However this concern was unfounded , Disney has got things organised so well it made for a great experience. Staff  were all excellent. The park seemed pretty clean to us.There seemed to be a little less character meet opportunities that other parks, especially princesses. The parade though if right on the Disney mark. Rides (especially TRON and Pirates) and other attractions were really good, we made good use of the fast pass system. The night show was very impressive and my daughter liked the fact it didn't have fireworks! Seeing classic Disney shows in Mandarin was certainly a different experience! Despite our apprehensions, at the right time of year we would certainly return."
89,4.0,Oct 2019,"Netanya, Israel ",Wonderful family fun. More fun if you know Chinese!,"Make sure you book your entrance tickets before you get to the park so as not to waste time. I would highly recommend that you also buy a Fast Pass ticket as well so as to avoid standing in line for a long time even though it’s very expensive. Above all, make sure you don’t go there on the weekend or during a national holiday because you could find yourself standing in line for two or three hours. Not only does that exhaust you and your kids, but you won’t be able to enjoy very many of the activities offered.Disneyland Shanghai is a Chinese version of Disney World and therefore, you will not find most of the Disney characters and stories you would expect in the American version. In addition, all the animations are in Chinese, so you only understand what they are singing or saying by the familiar music and scenes enacted.I realize that Disneyland Shanghai is specially for the Chinese, but it’s a pity that most of the people working there don't know a word of English so it’s hard to ask for information. This could easily be solved by equipping the employees with a smartphone app that simultaneously translates English to Chinese and Chinese to English both in writing and orally.We were given a map of the park at the entrance which should have been useful, but, although the various attractions were numbered, there were no numbers outside the actual activity itself, so we kept on having to ask people where specific attractions were. That’s when we “realized” how little Chinese we understood or how little English the Chinese understood!All in all, although it’s exhausting by the end of the day, it’s fun when traveling with children."
90,5.0,Sep 2019,"New York City, NY ",The VIP Tour/Premiere Access is Excellent,"We did  the VIP tour and though it was expensive we felt it was well worth it.Coming from the U.S. we knew we would not be back that quickly and we wanted to maximize our attraction time and minimize our Disney line time.I think its worth it for several reasons:You are assigned your own dedicated tour guide. We did the tour for two days and our Disney guides were thorough and knowledgable.We went on every ride/attraction we wanted to as many times as we wanted to - without any wait. We were able to access back exits where we simply went on the ride. No wait at all.The VIP tour also includes a special, unobstructed view area for the Disney Parade.Also included is a special area for the Disney Castle Projection Show - again with access to a roped off unobstructed and comfortable viewing area.As a reference point I took the VIP tours in Tokyo Disney and Paris Disney and they were not as thorough and encompassing as the Shanghai personal Disney tour.The Shanghai VIP experience will have you loving Disney.Overall I found Shanghai Disneyland to be excellent - the park is well maintained, the crowds are really into the Disney spirit and the food is better than most Disney Parks.There are also great dining options in the shopping area before entering Disney.The only shortcoming to the park is that there are not enough rides - however as the park matures I'm sure it will expand and new rides and attractions will open."
91,4.0,Oct 2019,"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia ",One fun day,"Buy ticket online. Is more convenient as you don’t need to queue again for ticket after security check. Just go straight to the entrance gate and ticket will be issued to you. We reached around 8.55am and got into the park by 9.30am. We managed to get fast pass for the Seven Dwarf Mine Trains schedule at 11.20am (soaring over the horizon already finished) You can get the fastpass around every two hours even the previous pass has not been used. In the end, we managed to get 4 in total. For adult, i would recommend Tron follow by Camp Discovery Challenge Trails, Pirate of Caribbean and Mine Train. For those with kids, go for Pirate of Caribbean, Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and Buzz Lightyear Planet Rescue. Peter Pan’s Flight and Voyage to Cristal Grotto are not too impressive."
92,5.0,Oct 2019,"Singapore, Singapore ",An amazing experience,"Shantung Disneyland is the best experience I have among all the Disneyland especially compare to Japan and Hong Kong. We took almost all rides and only one ride which we queue for 45 minutes, other were less than 15 minutes even the most popular ride such as The Pirates of eh Caribbean, Peter Pan. Also we saw all the shows and performances. However the food inside was extremely expensive compare to town. A set of Burger cost RMB 90 and the same set if buy in town the maximum cost is RMB 30. Even if in Disney town (just next to Disneyland) it only cost half of the price. So it will be wise to eat at Disney town than Disneyland."

Once inside the large site absorbs visitors well and even without fast passes we were able to complete plenty of rides. TRON is only available here and the very unique Pirates of the Caribbean ride are great specialities."

The park was amazing, even without being able to speak Chinese we were able to find our way around. The app wasn’t always working in telling us where we were located or which direction we were going but we managed either way. You can definitely tell the rides are not made for the thrills, while fun, they were easy for my husband to do which means not for true thrill seekers. It is a Disney park though so we weren’t expecting anything like a six flags. Pirates of the Caribbean was a great ride with the way they have done it! Reds racer was cool and the mine train was fun. Was a little disappointed you can only get a fast pass every 2 hours and by the time I went to get my next one Soaring over the Horizon was gone. We waited for 50 mins for that ride anyway because it’s a great must do ride.It could get confusing especially when a parade was on and you are trying to get somewhere too. "

Of course the main rides not to miss are Pirates of the Caribbean, 7DMT, Soaring Over the Horizon and Tron. Lines might be longer than other rides but well worth the wait. I had to wing it due to no cell service for fast pass but was still able to get on everything. Way different than any other Disney park and the staff did their best to help when needed. English was broken but understandable and helpful. Just be mindful of line jumping and parade watching. Guests tend to work their way in front of you."

101,5.0,Oct 2019,"Chandler, AZ ","Love Shanghai Disneyland, Exceeded My Expectations","We already had plans to make a family trip to Shanghai for our kids Fall Break from school from Arizona, so naturally visiting Shanghai Disneyland was a must. We visited right after their national holiday to beat the crowds.I was a bit cautious after reading tons of reviews and watching videos on YouTube. But I’ll share my perspective.Shanghai Disneyland is beautiful and huge (tons of space, never felt crowded, except during the parades and fireworks), and it’s very clean and modern. Didn’t see any trash anywhere and no one spitting or peeing in public. And for the most part the locals adhered to basic queuing rules, no one cutting. The closest thing is someone trying to jostle for position when trying to secure a spot at the parade (my tip: make it very clear where your position is physically and be greedy, don’t let any local try to take your spot). The rides at Shanghai Disneyland are awesome and the rides you’ve heard about are definitely not to be missed, especially Tron... hands down the best ride I’ve ever taken, it’s like being in a summer movie with the music, the atmosphere, and the ride, it’s amazing! Other rides not to miss is Pirates, Roaring Rapids, and Challenge Trails. One caveat with Challenge Trails though, you can’t take your smart phone or camera with you on this. My guess is that the experience is slightly on the risky side for a Disney park and they don’t want any negative PR due to a random YouTube video. I can almost guarantee you’ll never see Challenge Trails at any Disney Park in the US or Europe. But overall it’s worth it, especially if you want to experience challenges from heights on swinging bridges right next to waterfalls that are reminiscent of Indiana Jones! For a novice like me, it was definitely thrilling to say the least.I highly recommend staying at the Shanghai Disneyland Hotel, this is what we did, along with a Two Day Park pass. The hotel is top notch, up there with the best Disney hotels and the rates are much cheaper than western prices. The two day park (non-peak) pass ended up being about $55-60 per day, which is about half the price at Disneyland in Anaheim. Doing this gives you one hour Early Entry into the park, using the priority gate thru Disney Town. You can easily knock out 3 of the most popular rides during this time... I saw some people get ride back on Tron after already riding it once or twice that morning. And each guest gets one free FastPass for a specified ride on a specific date and time. Here’s a couple somewhat negative points I did want to share as well. First point, I believe Shanghai Disneyland is the only Disney park where smoking is allowed in designated areas. And being a family friendly park this is definitely noticeable. Smoking culture is a big part of traveling/living in China, so it’s something that can’t be understated.Second point, you can tell that China isn’t quite into the Disney culture like most western countries are, so you’ll see most locals aren’t wearing any Disney gear and often don’t seemed enthusiastic and don’t appreciate being at one of the best Disney parks in the world. I honestly think this goes along way into what some reviewers comments about not having the “Disney Magic”. Another observation related to this: the Shanghai Disneyland Hotel didn’t have any Disney programming (eg: no Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD), I couldn’t believe it! But don’t let this discourage your experience, because we absolutely loved Shanghai Disneyland! And we will definitely visit again! Looks like their expanding their park to, to include Zootopia Land in 2020. "
102,5.0,Oct 2019,"Auckland, New Zealand ",Awesome day!,"We visited Shanghai Disneyland the week after Golden Week. Having been to 3 other Disneyland’s around the world we would rate this as one of our favourites. Not as big, lovely clean and new, very manageable in a day. The crowds were not bad at all (we struck it very lucky), the longest we waited was 20 minutes for a couple of rides. Most of them we did on fast pass or only had to wait 5-10 mins. We loved the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. Our children age 9 loved the dwarfs train ride rollercoaster. The tron is also amazing. A good tip is to exit the park through Disneytown to have lunch. There are many restaurants there and the food is good and reasonably priced. The park is spacious and the layout means it didn’t feel crowded at all. Highly recommend for a fun family day.

No parede with all the princesses.You also hardly see princesses and characters / only ok the photo paid spots. Queues were very long. We know that all Disneys are crowded, but in Shanghai that’s even more so.

106,3.0,Oct 2019,Bangkok ,If you know other Disneys this one isn’t worth it,"We chose a day marked “regular” as opposed to “peak”. What was disappointing: they don’t have the attraction ‘Small World’, which, to us, is really a signature of Disney and celebrates diversity of cultures. The night parede with lights was about Halloween at 7.30pm. Most, if not all, characters are then playing villains and making angry bad faces. There was a huge number of small kids and I found that it wasn’t the best way for the little ones to end their day - with villains.No parede with all the princesses, but a few. To note that the parades last shorter than other Disneys.You also hardly see princesses and characters / only ok the photo paid spots. Queues were very long.

108,5.0,Jul 2019,"Farmington, ME, ",stay local,"We wanted to do something special for our children during our trip to Asia... Shanghai Disney was a perfect option to let them have a break from history, etc.  We stayed at the Toy Story resort which was perfect for us.  Staying on the Disney property allowed us to enter the park through a separate entrance an hour before opening.  This was ideal as it afforded the opportunity to get in a ride or two before it was very busy.  We also we able to book a fast pass early each day so we were set for a good morning.  We also planned to visit during the week (Thursday/Friday) to avoid some of the weekend crowds (after reading several reviews of the lines, etc.).   I did notice people queuing up very (very) early for the 'regular' entrance on Saturday morning before we departed so our stay local/visit during the week plan seemed to have worked.  Honestly, it was not as hot or crowded as I thought it would be based on research.  Yes, culturally it seems there is less concern for personal space or regard for lines - just accept this, take a deep breath, and stand your ground when needed.  Using the fast pass is key though with younger children (4yo) the lines for these rides were not as bad as the more thrilling rides.  Also key to visit later at night or during the fireworks/parade if you want to skip this part of the visit.  The park is not too large - we stayed two days just to make sure we were not too rushed and to allow for nap-time, avoiding over-tired breakdowns. The one thing we struggled with was food - of course you cannot bring in your own food or drinks (other than water) - and we were challenged to find vegetarian options. One or two of the dining options had one veggie option and there is no ability to modify the menu items - or maybe there is if you can speak the language however, I think they are pretty well set.  We found the best option for veggie choices was the Cheesecake Factory just outside the gate in Downtown Disney - sad but true.  I would highly recommend the Chocolate Chip Cookies at Remy's Patisserie... OMG it has been over two months and I am STILL thinking about how delicious that cookie was... there are also plenty of options for 'local food' options to make it more of a Chinese cultural experience.  Overall a great experience for our 10 and 4yo children - would recommend visiting if you have the time."
109,3.0,Sep 2019,N/A,Queue everywhere!,"Come at least 1 hour before the gate open to queue! Queue for security check and queue to enter!Must download the Disneyland app to buy Tickets 1 day before going, fastpass and others info like waiting time, attractions and direction, etc. Its great to spend time with kids here but a lot of attractions like Rides are mainly for kids above 1 meter, so if your kids are below that height, they can hardly play anything. Food are not great at all, expensive and taste bad but you will need to eat there anyways since they do not allowed outside food. Most recommended ride will be Tron!"
110,2.0,Oct 2018,"Brisbane, Australia ",Very long day ,We have been to several Disneyland’s and the Shanghai one is the worst. Busy and the language barrier is real bad at times. The food and drink are also expensive. 
111,5.0,Sep 2019,N/A,Muat visit if you have a day to spare,"Located in Pudong (about 20 minutes from the airport and 40 minutes from downtown Pudong), this is one of my family’s favorite places to unwind.It comprises of 5 themed areas and is big enough that you will need a full day to cover. Depending on the time of the year, waiting times for popular rides can be as long more than 2 hours for Soaring over the Horizon, and over an hour for Rex's Racer, Tron and Seven Dwarfs Mine Train. During non peak season, those waiting times will come down significantly to within 30-60 minutes for the popular rides.If you would like to cover most of the rides and shows, then you will need to enter the park at opening time and leave at closing. Be sure to download the Shanghai Disneyland app as it is tied to your ticket and that is how you obtain Fast passes.There are also plenty of food options within the park as well as at Disneytown, which is adjacent  and within walking distance from the park."

113,5.0,Sep 2019,"Dakar, Senegal ",Wonderful Disney experience ,"I saw a handful of the previous bad reviews, but I was in Shanghai for business and a few colleagues wanted to check out Shanghai Disney.  After visiting, I wonder where the bad reviewers actually went.  Shanghai Disney was a wonderful experience!  As the newest Disney park, it was exceptionally clean, well maintained and a day full of fun.  The price (roughly $57.00 for admission) was a lot better than going to a park in the U.S.  and that included a ¥85 ($12.00) meal voucher.  Ride lines were not too bad (normal for an amusement park)- I think the longest we stood in line was about 40 minutes, but most lines were about 10-30 minutes.  The park is easy to get around and had some great rides.  Make time for Tron and the Pirates of the Caribbean!! We went on a Monday, but Sunday’s lines looked a lot shorter as we tracked it on the app."
114,5.0,Sep 2019,"Toronto, Canada ",Wow amazing! ,My husband and I visited shanghai Disneyland September 5th 2019 and it was amazing! We were prepared for the worst because of bad reviews but it was a perfect day! We heard lots about people pushing and the park being dirty and line ups being terribly long but it was anything but! The park was spotless and the people were so helpful! Most of the staff understood English and if they didn’t they would find someone who did. We purchased tickets on the app on my phone and security at the front was easy to get through. Just proceed directly to the turnstiles and they will ask for your passport and take your photo and hand you a paper ticket. It took us about 30 min to get through and into the park. We showed up about an hour early and there was already a line. The longest lineup we waited for was about 15 min. We were going to purchase the premier access pass but it wasn’t needed. We used the app to get regular free fast passes which you can get one at a time and it worked great. I have a Canadian Rogers phone and i was able to get the in park wifi working no problem and the signal was strong and not spotty. The washrooms are spotless and they have both western toilets and squatting toilets. The drinking water stations are safe to drink and we filled our water bottles multiple times for free. If you rather purchase bottled water it was 10rmb each. The food prices are comparable to Disneyworld and Disneyland in the states. It was very easy ordering food and everything we ate was delicious! Everything was in both English and Mandarin. Some of the staff have big ASK ME buttons on their chest and those are the cast members that speak the best English. I also have a peanut allergy and I had one of my mandarin speaking friends write me a note that says I am allergic to show the chef so make sure it was safe to eat. It wasn’t a problem at all and the manager would come over to help and speak to the chef for me. Bringing epipens into the park was not a problem. We ate at tangled tavern and wandering moon restaurant. We paid 200rmb for the combo meals for two people. They were very accommodating. The only time that the park felt busy was the evening fireworks so get a spot early at the front of the castle. The souvenirs were also very similarly priced to the United States parks. We paid 150rmb for a shirt and about 150rmb for a hat. We stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott hotel and they have a free shuttle to and from Disney and it was very easy to use and easy to find. The driver doesn’t speak English but he has a sign that you point to to tell him where you want to go because there is a second bus that goes to a different hotel. When we went it was so so hot out so make sure to bring water (they will take food at security) and a hat and sunscreen and a towel because you will be sweating like crazy! All the stores are air conditioned and most of the lineups for rides are too. All in all it was a great trip and everything was super easy to navigate and the people were so wonderful! We only needed the one day here at the park and we got on every ride! Our two favourites was Tron and Pirates of the Caribbean! Mind blowing! The castle is massive!

116,5.0,Sep 2019,"Perth, Australia ",Aarrmmazing! Definetly do a Disney Premier Access Pass,"This was our 6 our of 6 Disneylands around the world. Last one being Shanghai. And man alive it was  a awesome day out and we loved it so much. Best rides were Tron, Soaring over the Horizon and Pirates of the Carribean. Like any other Disney we went early! We went on a public holiday too which I thought would be horrific but it wasnt. Only the line to get in was long but moved pretty fast. We left our hotel in Pudong at 7 sharp and the gates opened at 830. There are people always trying to push past you but stand your ground. This is everywhere as well..lines for food, rides, photos with mickey. You sort of get used to it after a while and it doesnt affect you as much.  We didnt take any food and lucky because we saw some food being taken off people. We took empty water bottles and there are stations where you can fill them up all over Disney. Number 1 tip. As soon as you get in the gates book a fastpass. We booked ours for Tron. Then we got Premier Access Passes. Costed $400 CNY each which gives you a fastpass to the best rides. Tron, Soaring over the Horizon, Buzz Lightyear, Seven Dwarfs Minetrain, Roaring Rapids, Peter Pans Flight, Pirates of the Carribean and Winnie the Pooh. This was the best decision ever! That combined with the fastpass and single rider we rode all the top rides at least 3 x  over in one day. Also there are single riders that hardly anyone uses which is awesome if you willing to be separated from your group. But they do close off the single rider lanes around lunch. Tip 2. Take good shoes, umbrellas and hats. Tip 3. Food like a corn dog is $40 CNY and water is $10 CNY which is quite reasonable. Tip 4. Most team members dont speak english but they will usually get someone who does speak english to speak to you. Tip 5. Stay at one of the Disney Hotels. We didnt and thats why we ended up coming back before the fireworks. So tired from being there so early. Tip 6. Get a VPN before you come. If you dont be prepared for no google, Facebook, Instagram or YouTube or Netflix. It drops out every now and then but is better then nothing. Express VPN is what we got. Free trial so nothing to pay. Tip 7. Have a China Sim Card. The wifi at Disney drops out and you need a sim card that receives txts to get the wifi. So buy a international sim card. All in all thoroughly reccomend Shanghai Disney. We will definetly be back. "

118,3.0,Jul 2019,Jakarta ,What can I say..,"We went here in beginning of July, it's summer in shanghai. We're experiencing unfriendly weather, very hot day. Pretty easy to get here, just take the shanghai sub line 11 and in an hour you will arrived in Disney Resort station the last station of the line. You need to buy the entry ticket online fee days before the day. And you have to submit your ID or passport number to buy. On arrival go straightly queue on the main gate entrance. You only need to mention your ID/passport number to the gatekeeper and.. voila! You are in.. Best for you to download the Shanghai Disney's app, there's a map and guidance that will be very helpful in this app. You must I think, since they are rarely provide a print out maps. Then you can linked your tickets to the apps. Creepy thing is my photo was pop in the apps after I linked it with my ticket. As other Disneylands like, it's crowded.. unfortunately the crowd behaviour unlike in other Disneylands.. You need to be extra patient for queuing.  Beside a long waiting (1 hour the faster, up to 3-4hrs for popular rides) people like to and tend to cut the line. In every way they can.. literally.. and even some peeing in line.. gosh.. Disneyland is Disneyland.. waiting and queuing is part of the experience besides fun.. but with the local people's attitude is really disappointing.. What can I say.."
119,2.0,Aug 2019,"Los Angeles, CA","Usual Disney immersive experience, but no line etiquette, 2 hours just to get in","We researched a bit before going, even still the experience of the lines and the trash in those lines was shocking. We were told to line up by 7:00 am for the park opening at 9:00 am.We did that and found ourselves behind over 10,000 people that had been camping out,  even longer. It took two and half hours to get through security and then the park entrance. As we got closer to security we found more and more trash, empty cans, bags, banana peals, and even toilet paper, on the ground.But the most annoying thing by far was the complete lack of line etiquette. The culture is one of expecting you to get as close to the person in front of you as possible. If a space opens up for a second, the person behind you assumes you no longer care or that another isle has appeared in the line and they will push past. Another strategy is to send their children to pass under you. Then the children wave the parents forward. The parent then try to explain that is their child and therefore they must move past. I would explain back that I now own that child and they would have to pay me in order to get them back. This made for an exhausting day as I spnt the bulk of it stretched between both rails of any line I was in.The other thing that has happened in China Disney is that a cottage industry has evolved in the form of ""private guides"". Basically you pay a fee similar to the ticket price in order to get 6 fast passes that are acquired by folks that get in before the masses. They then guide you to the 6 different rides. If you go despite my review, I highly recommend this approach. Otherwise expect 2-3 hours of lines for any interesting ride.Two exceptional things were the Pirate ride and Snow Whites Castle. Both were nearly seamless integration of high tech screens and animatronics. My advise, if you simply must go, avoid the summer heat, its unbearable. Go in the Spring or Fall."

It may be the magic was lost in translation but overall it felt the local cast members were going through the motions rather than creating Disney Magic. The problem isn't the lines it's having to fight for you place in line as people try to cut in front, the trash found across the park also lowers the emersion experience. "

125,3.0,Aug 2019,"Rockingham, Australia ",2 Days at Shanghai Disneyland,"We purchased 2 annual passes prior to arriving on 27 August. There were only minor issues at the gate with having our online ticket issued as a real ticket. We then went to purchase a day photo pass. Thankfully the customer service girl used her wifi to set up the photo pass on my phone. Even with a VPN accessing the internet in China caused issues such as using a translator. We found while staff at Disneyland predominantly had English names, their ability to speak English was non existent. Waiting for photos to be taken was frustrating, especially when the characters had to take a rest, and announcements were in Chinese. Another frustration with the photo pass, people  with passes queued and others were permitted to have autographs signed, photos using phones and or cameras, thus making the wait time double. Prices for Disney merchandise was very reasonable as was the food throughout the precinct. We should also note, while there are signed designated smoking areas throughout the park, there were many people smoking wherever they wanted to. We encountered issues with Chinese people, the majority are rude, have no manners, push and shove regardless of their ages."
126,5.0,Aug 2019,"Hanoi, Vietnam ",Amazing ,"I'm a huge Disneyland fan and this didn't disappoint at all. Yes there are queues. I genuinely cant believe people are complaining about this... I didn't have a fast pass or the app and it was totally fine. Yes we queued but if you go early and act strategically its gonna be ok. We got there by 7.15. Inside the park at 8 buying my ticket. And I was in a queue by 8.15. Tron was closed when we first got in which was our first ride plan so we did some rides close to there until it opened. We queued for about 80mins for tron it was excellent too well worth the wait. However I have to say we did the park in the wrong order in hindsight. The queue for tron wasnt ever higher than 80 mins all day. The queue for the water Rapids and snow white train were mad all day. So I recommend going inside the park and doing all the fun family rides first to get them out the way before the queues are too much. We did single riders for snow white and it was fine not too long a wait. The food inside the park is all of a high standard, quite pricey for china to be honest. But totally reasonable and comparable to euro disney etc. The best ride for me was the Jack sparrow pirates of the Caribbean one. Absolutely amazing!!! We were in the park till 8pm and on the way out stopped in the cheesecake factory for a well deserved slice. It was a long tiring day but wow it was excellent. If you are a disney fan you need to go!"

129,2.0,Aug 2019,France ,Queues queues and more queues ,"Arrived here at 8am where we joined the first of many queues of the day. After 90 mins of queuing we finally made it through the gates (we had pre bought tickets and did not take any bags but that did not speed up the process)Once inside the WiFi was patchy and the app wasn’t working (for everyone not just us) so no fast passes were available. As a result the queues for all the rides were horrendous- up to 3 hours for the more popular ones, even 60-70 mins for the less popular ones. The fast pass system did come back online after lunch, but by the tine we were aware all the free passes had gone. In order to do a couple of the bigger rides we ended up paying for the premier pass for 2 rides. £140 later we could say we had done Tron and Pirates of the Caribbean!!! The food was pretty horrendous and expensive. The toilets were clean and well kept. Metro to and from is really easy to manage and cheaper and quicker than a taxi.All in all, we expect any Disneyland to be busy but to only manage 4 rides is very disappointing. That said the kids had a great day, as did Disney - we reckon we spent in the region of £500 on the trip with tickets/food/fast passes/gift shop! "
130,3.0,Aug 2019,"London, UK ",OK Experience but not for everyone,"We visited Disney on 20 August, 2019 (Tuesday), as are on holiday in China and did not want to go during weekends or when it's extremely busy there.We arrived around 10am, it took us about 15 minutes to get in.If you are a foreigner you cannot use FastPass before you physically get your Disney tickers in the park, so you can either stay in the resort (in hotel there) and do that, or go to the park just to pick up the tickets in advance, or alternatively ask someone Chinese to buy the tickets for you so you could start choosing FastPasses before you arrive....If you try to use FastPass on the day you arrive - it won't work, or at best you would get 1 FastPass for the day (we got 1 for a slot of 7-8pm .... some people might not stay until then) ... you can also go to the Guest Services at the entrance of the park to complain and then they might give you another FastPass but all in all - if you care about FastPass - use the suggestions above please.Other than that, we were a couple + toddler (3.5y) + a baby (1.5y), many Chinese people like our baby and asked for pictures.... The rides themselves are NOT in English which is a shame, also many employees in the park speak very little English but this is the same in China in general, you learn how to communicate with them using an online Translator or using gestures.The food/drinks stands have very limited availability - only water or Pepsi .. and they charge in the park 10 RMB for a small bottle of water of 20 RMB for a small bottle of Pepsi ... buy some if you wish from the Metro station before you arrive in the park for a 1/3 of the price ... they don't allow big bottles in the park but small ones are okay.I saw in other reviews some people had issues bringing in food, they did not give us troubles with this so I am not sure about it.Queues - they are long but towards 8pm onward you can get many rides with only 20-30 minutes of waiting. That is on Tuesday, not the weekend.Overall 3/5 - it's okay but that's it."

Disney staffs did not greet with welcoming smiles but gave a moody face. Disappointing standards for Disney.
135,2.0,Aug 2019,N/A,Shanghai Disneyland does not cater for tourists.,"Spent over $700 AUD for tickets for a family of four plus another $80 AUD for travel (to and from) and another $200 AUD on food and a few souvenirs. It was a waste of time, waste of money and a complete waste of an entire day. The queues were over 150 minutes each for most rides and we spent 10 hours there for a sum of four rides (two being kiddie rides as we ran out of patience with the queues), what a waste of a day! There are supposedly 25 million Chinese living in Shanghai and 24 million of them visited Disneyland. The number of free fastpasses available are extremely limited and are all gone within one hour of Disneyland opening (this was not mentioned in any brochures) but the staff then try to sell you VIP / Premier ride passes (costing over $100AUD each) to use the rides.I have recommended that tourists go somewhere else to have a more enjoyable and productive day. Wasting close to $1000 AUD for 4 rides for a family of 4 for 10 hours is a waste of time and money. Even going to two different guest services to complain was useless as I was directed to go to the front gate guest services which was a fair walk and only wasted more time. The front gate guest house only provided one family fast pass and only after going there twice. Shanghai Disneyland is not for tourists.Shanghai Disneyland should provide at least 2 fast passes per family who are visiting from overseas, travelled significant distances and spent considerable money to attend. My own children (15 years and 17 years gave Shanghai Disneyland a 5 out of 10 rating due to the long waiting times). I have experienced Disneyland in America (much shorter waiting times) over 20 years ago and now wanted to give my family a similar Disneyland experience but after this experience, I would not recommend it. As a tourist, it is not worth the cost, not worth the time and is a complete waste of a day (10 hours for 4 rides) that would be better spent elsewhere.This is feedback for you in hoping that some changes are made to benefit everyone instead of the current situation which will only 'turn off' tourists from going to Shanghai Disneyland."
136,2.0,Aug 2019,N/A,A pretty epic waste of time and money,"We had an extra day in Shanghai and fancied something different, and hopefully, fun. It was not. After paying 575RMB for each ticket (not a small amount of money) and queuing for security, ticket office and general entry, we got into the park at 1030am. It was already busy. We, perhaps, foolishly thought we'd get the bigger rides done first so we headed for Tron. The queuing systems are utterly shambolic and while there are security guards in place they either don't care or don't see the numerous people pushing into all of the queues. Sometimes this is one family member queuing and then inviting the other 4 in but on other occasions we saw entire groups  happily ducking under the inadequate rope barriers that form most of the queues. It was so ridiculous that we even intervened when some people pushed directly in front of us. Seemingly most local people this without complaint. If the park changed the queue systems to solid barriers this would happen far less. Huge amounts of people seem to pay extra for the fastpass so the now insultingly named 'standby queue' (what the hell did I pay 575RMB if it's just standby?) Is even longer. Of the attractions we managed two - the pirates of the Caribbean and some buzz lightyear target practice thing. Every other main attraction (run away train, log flume, tron, rapids) had a queue of between 165 and 185 minutes. What with the wholly ridiculous queuing systems and unfair rule breaking we were not prepared to wait this long for a max 7 minute ride at the end.The two or three activities we did do were impressive and the park is done well, as you expect from Disney. But save your sanity and money and do something far more fun. I don't have kids but work with children and I would genuinely recommend not bringing them here and putting them through this actually difficult experience of being tantalisingly close to fun but never actually achieving it. The famous Disney magic was sadly lacking for most people I saw."
137,5.0,Jul 2019,"White Plains, NY ",The world’s best Magic Kingdom - under appreciated ,"Perhaps because of it’s relative newness (only open 3+ years) and location (Shanghi) this amusement park is vastly underrated on the rankings of global amusement parks.Although It is hard to compare the 6 different global magic kingdoms as each one has unique features, my daughter and I who have now been to all 6, think this one is the best (ex crazy lines) of the bunch and if not now certainly will be in a few years.A primary benefit is the newness of the park as all of the attractions are in near mint condition.  Disney lovers will be disappointed by the lack of some of the all-time classics including: No version of “It’s a Small World,” no Space Mountain, No Haunted House, No Monorail, No Railroad, No Tomorrowland Speedway and no Splash Mountain to name a few.  But this is offset by the best global version of a Pirates of the Caribbean, the best version of Buzz Lightyear (laser guns that are very accurate), Tron (a motorcycle type rollercoaster), a very underrated “Challenge Trails Course” - a tethered rope course and possibly our favorite attraction a5 the park and excellent parades and evening light show & fireworks with excellent viewing.Now it is not all wonderful - as the summer crowds overwhelm the ride capacity of the park and the top tier rides have monster standby wait times.  The summer heat and humidity are oppressive.  So I would certainly go for an off peak time.You can get one fast pass (download app before you go) each hour depending on availability, but if you aren’t in the park at opening you are not likely to get more than one fast pass.  We were there early and only got 2.  By the time we were able to get a 3rd - everything was gone (this was in addition to our concierge passes - see below).  That pass gives you one fast pass per ride, but you can get others with the regular admission ticket.  You need your ticket linked to the app and you have to be in the park to try for fast passes.Unlike the US Disney’s - for those willing to pay up to avoid the lines they have an excellent “concierge services package” classic and deluxe versions.  The classic gives you early access (enter park 1 hour before opening), fast passes to all of the rides with fast pass except the new toy story rides (Rex racer & woody’s roundup) and the challenge trails.  You also get preferred reserved seating for parade and nighttime light show.  The Deluxe version adds in the fast pass attractions not in the classic.  The package adds about 1.5-2x the cost of the regular admission.  The concierge ticket is only available about 7-10 days in advance and the classic often sells out.If you have a limited time - ie 1 day to visit or hate lines - this ticket is an absolute must and well worth it.  The ticket needs to be picked up in person at a separate ticket widow and honestly the customer service is too slow for a premium ticket like this.  We got to the park an hour early and then waited on line for 30 minutes to get processed through.  We still had 30 minutes of early access time (most fast pass rides are open during this period), but the full hour would have been a lot better.  If you want to use this pass and early access - I’d suggest getting to the park at least 90 minutes in advance of the regular open time.For late sleepers, the best time in the park is on nights park is open after fireworks (normally 8:30 show).  Park clears out after the light and fireworks show and you can get in a lot of rides).For those with specific ride interests - fast passes can be purchased for individual rides or in packages - they r7n about 150 yuan per ride depending on availability.Again the park is relatively new and they haven’t figured out staffing - they don’t have enough drink stands or snack stands.  They also don’t open when the park opens - so you can get frustrated looking for water or a snack.Overall it is a great park with a promising future.  Certain to move up the world park rankings as more and more people visit the park.  Certainly worth a day if you are visiting shanghi with family."
138,5.0,Jul 2019,"Dallas, TX ",It's amazing,"Shanghai Disneyland has the best rides .... Pirates of the Cribeans is like spectacular....OMG, never rode anything like it before... Other rides are also newer and better than the ones in the states. We went on a hot Wednesday during summer and we didn't experience that big of a crowd like everyone was talking about. Florida and Orange county Disneyland are more crowded than Shanghai Disneyland to me. I think only the few very popular rides have long lines and everything else is not that bad. We booked on site hotels so we got in one hour before the general population and I think that helps to ride Soaring over Herizon for only 50 mins line... My daughter is not tall enough for other popular rides such as Tron so we really didn't have any super long lines.. The park itself is beautiful and typical...We had an amazing time there and it doesn't mean it's perfect.. I slipped over a small wet area in the morning and there is no warning for it so one of my foot actually hurts most of the day.... I don't think the cast members are very English fluent.. so if you are one of those people who doesn't speak Chinese you need to study your map hard.... There is one time another person tried to fill in the space between me and the group before me, that does felt like she was trying to cut in front me so I stopped her. The food in Disneyland Shanghai is very expensive...It's no cheaper than the states..."
139,5.0,Mar 2019,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates ",The most technologically advanced and hi tech equipped Disneyland in the whole world,"This theme park is a dream come true not just for children, but for young-at-hearts as well. I like how they synchronised each ride. There is hologram and 9D tech rides. There is always a long cue, so I suggest that you purchase a fast pass ticket. 2 days will be needed to completely explore the place and discover what it has to offer. There are quite good restaurants inside the park."

141,1.0,Jul 2019,"Calgary, Canada ",Lack of  Disney Magic.,"I have been to about 5 of the Disney resorts around the world and Shanghai Disney ranks as the worst of them. Mind you we went during the school holiday for Shanghai and the crowds were quite numerous to begin with.We got to the park at rope drop (8:30AM) but there was already a line at security to get into the park. There were people that were cutting us off in order to get in front of us. Since it was quite sunny, people with umbrella were constant jabbing me in the head as well as pushing me forward when the line was not moving. A total disregard for personally space. On top of that, there were only four security lines on each side of the entrance to check bags. I would expect that since this was a school holiday, that they would open more security lines. From what I observed, there were removing food from peoples bags and that was it. It took two hours to get through the initial line.The fastpass system in Orlando you can buy your tickets online and be able to book your fastpass before you enter the park. In Shanghai, you can buy the tickets on the app, however you need to bring your passport and ""claim"" your ticket at the gate. Then register your ticket and book your fastpass. There seems to be no way as a foreign visitor to get your ticket in advance (unless you stay at the resort) and be able to book your fastpass rides. I notice that most of the locals were able to get tickers ahead of time. As a result by the time we even got through the gate, all the Fastpass rides were already claimed well into the late evening. So you end up paying 150RMB on rides such as Tron and Roaring Rapids to skip the line.While in the park, please insure that you have cash on you as many of the food stands do not take credit cards at all. It's either the Chinese pay apps or cash.The park itself is quite gorgeous and the rides like Tron and Pirates of Caribbean are quite thrilling and very immersive. The obstacle course in Camp Discovery is quite fun. They do have some unique things that are part of the park like the Garden of Imagination. Though it is missing the magic that rest of the parks have. There is no wandering characters or staff that enhance or create an atmosphere in the park. The ride staff do not seem to be happy to be there or are barking out instructions.My recommendation if you are wanting to come to Shanghai Disneyland. If you can, book a stay on the on site hotel. Make sure you use the app. Do not bring any outside food beside water. Go during the winter or off season."
142,5.0,Jul 2019,"Stockholm, Sweden ","A wonderful time to pass a day, Don’t forget the sun screen and water","I have been to several of the Disney parks around the world and I was delighted to see that Disneyland Shanghai had several unique and several updated attractions not available in any other park I have been to. The biggest surprise was Pirates of the Caribbean that was much better than in the other parks, do not miss!We were there on a Wednesday in the end of July. It took about 30min by taxi from the Bund and cost around 100yen. We came to the park 7.15 in the morning and there were already a lot of people in line to get in. We bought breakfast at Sturbucks outside the park and went to the entrance que. We got in to the park at 8.35, after security check.Do not forget to bring a lot of water, hats and umbrellas for the que outside the entrance! There is a lot of people there and the sun shines bright over the que so you want to protect yourselves.When you have passed the entrance, make sure to log in to Disneyland’s wifi network and get fast track tickets connected to your disneyland app (wifi not only available for chinese phone numbers as someone said in a recommendation, just enter your international phone number and you will recieve a text code to log in). The fast passes runs out pretty quickley but if you get one directly in the morning you should be able to get one or two more during the day (you can ask for a new every two hours until they are out). You can also buy extra fast passes throughout the day to one or several attractions.Once you are inside of the enterance, the park is big and does not feel crowded. There where no que at any of the restaurants or snack charts throughout the day and the que time for attractions were normally 10-40 minutes on the common attractions . You could tell they had a capacity to have a lot more people in the ques on most attractions, so you should probably avoid to be here on a weekend. As always in theme parks, there were some popular attractions that had longer ques (75-135min) so try to get fast pass tickets to those. A positive, inovative thing was that the park had mobile games in some of the ques connected to the attraction, so you had something to do while you wait in line, good thinking! Use the app to move around. There you see the waiting time for all attractions so you can adapt your plan where to go.Do not forget to bring extra sun screen! The sun was strong in July and it was very hot.The food and merchendise were not so expensive if you compare with theme parks in other countries, but a bit expensive if you compare with general prices in China.The food inside the park was ok, they had both Chinese and western style food on several places. For dinner we ate in Disneytown, where there were a lot of good restaurants to chose from (but more fine dining restaurants compared to inside the park).Enjoy your time on Disneyland. Do not forget to stay hydrated and drink a lot of water!"
143,1.0,Aug 2018,N/A,Long wait lines and questionable security,"Went to disneyland anticipating fun and games. Reality: Massive queues, overpriced things. The security wouldn't let us bring a glass bottle, because it was a ""safety hazard"" for small children, even though the bottle was encased in some kind of soft material. If that wasn't enough, when you walk into one of the gift shops, like half of the things were made of glass."
144,5.0,Jul 2019,"Sydney, Australia ",Annual Passholder - Love China,"We love China. We love the people and the things to do there. We love Shanghai Disney. We now have annual passes for all of the Asian parks even though we are from Australia. (We have had annual passes for all of the Disney parks at one time or another and our Paris ones are about to expire- never to be renewed)We use google translate to help us out when we can't be understood (download the mandarin) . There is something magical about the park being Chinese. It is so unique in its style and the merchandise is wonderful . And the Chinese food is phenomenal. This is not kiddy food. You won't find cheeseburgers and fries in every restaurant (although if you are looking for this, there is a hamburger restaurant near Tron) We have been going every July since it opened (so 4 years) for 4 full days and yes you have to navigate crowds but everyone is happy and excited. In July is is usually at least 36 (feels like 46 degrees) and yet people are happy and smiling. Stand at the caste during the water show and get drenched with everyone else for a big old happy giggle fest of joy. Stay in one of the two hotels to get early entry and your own park entrance and then you don't have to go into the 2 hour security line. The people love this park so that is what you need to expect. Buy premium fast passes on your phone after you enter the park (expensive but if you only have a day...) - you will need the app but the free Wifi in the park is excellent. The park is clean and well maintained. People are super polite and friendly. Smile and be happy. Some of the rides are the best Disney rides in the world. The Tarzan show is amazing. Pay more (this will need to be in cash if you are a foreigner) and see the Broadway Beauty and the Beast in Mandarin. You won't need to understand the dialogue if you know the story (like seeing an Italian Opera) and the stars and cast are the best I have ever seen.Phenomenal. Pay for the day long photo pass and get professional grade digital photos downloadable to your phone of you and the characters or at various parts throughout the park. (Great free Wifi to do this)I am biased as I said, we love China and the Chinese culture and we feel so at home in Shanghai Disney. We are real Disney tragics. We will be back in October for a weekend to experience their Halloween."
145,2.0,Sep 2018,Belfast ,Worst Disney Park I’ve seen,"We visited this park in eager anticipation, as we loved Disney World Orlando and also the Disneyland Parks in Paris and California.  But this was terrible and very disappointing for my son.  There were long queues to get in, and we only got on one ride despite being there for 6 hours!  The FASTPASS system just didn’t work, and they were all gone early in the morning, which I’ve never seen in any of the other Disney parks.  The parade was great and we managed to get a great spot to watch it.   The language barrier wasn’t an issue, everything is signposted in both Mandarin and English.  "
146,1.0,Jul 2019,"Truro, UK ",Has good medical centre... and needs it,"Visited on a 36C day. Massive queue through security. taking food off people who have paid £60+ per ticket seems a bit mad - and there are no warning signs or places for people to dump stuff like in airports to speed things up. We had nothing on us, but people in front were literally stuffing their faces with cans of food before moving on. There was no way to avoid the queue for those without bags.We eventually got in, went to Marvel Universe which was better than expected with nice interactive game (30 minute wait in air con).Next we went to the Seven Dwarfs train ride. The queue was advertised as 105 minutes but was much longer. The first half of the wait there was no shade. We had taken water with us, but this was exhausted quickly under the glare of the sun. Eventually got on the ride - quite fun but not really worth the wait.My wife then felt ill - I got water from the strategically placed stall (somehow I think Disney know you will be thirsty after such a wait), but it was too late. My wife had heat stroke and spent the next 3 hours in the medical centre before transferring to the local hospital. The staff were caring and clearly prepared- they must get this a lot. If Disney had provided a water fountain half way on a 2 hour queue or even sold bottles half way then we wouldn’t have had such an experience. There are simply too many people being allowed to pay large sums on tickets to get into what is the first phase of the building of the park.I would say leave it a few years before going to this Disneyland - perhaps with more rides the average wait will go down.Otherwise, please take more water than you can imagine you will need into the longer queues. Thankfully my wife is now okay but the experience was not a great one for us."
147,3.0,Apr 2019,"Penang Island, Malaysia ",Amazing Theme Park but You Must have Patience,"We bought 2-day tickets to enjoy all the rides in Shanghai Disneyland during weekday. The park was really big, we used the Shanghai Disneyland application for navigation and fastpass. There was a long queue for security check. So do bear in mind to wear comfortable footwear, bring raincoat for roaring rapid rides and bring bottle to fill water. You can bring bag but do not put any food in your bag or else it will be discarded. Worry not for Muslims there is a halal Xinjiang food stall (Yershari Xinjiang) in the Food Republic at the Disneytown located in front of Disneyland. You can enter back the Disneyland after going out. The lamb skewer is their specialty. However, there might be a problem in communication in ordering food due to language barrier. Show them your entrance ticket to get discount. We felt uncomfotable and disappointed with the local visitors who tend to abruptly cutting lines during rides and push you during parade. If you want to watch the parade and fireworks, it was almost impossible to get a good viewing spot because of their impolite and selfish behaviour by putting their children on their shoulder and their legs kicking my head so many times. They were rushing everywhere and tend to run over my foot with baby's stroller and wheel chair without single apologies. My foot was bruised and painful. If possible do not go into the crowd as it might cause injuries.  It seems that this theme park was opened mainly to target the large local population. All the language used was mainly in Chinese and not tourist friendly. Despite waiting in long lines for a few minutes rides, we enjoyed the amazing rides in Shanghai Disneyland. The staffs and guards were really helpful by showing us the location of Food Republic and water fountain. The washroom was really clean and accesible everywhere.There are lockers provided for bags in certain rides. If you want to ride the taxi follow the signboard to the west transport hub (taxi terminal).MUST try ridesPIRATES OF CARIBBEAN- Treasure Cove (amazing ship adventure with 4D)TRONS- Tomorrowland (thrilling rides and not suitable for children and elders)SOARING OVER HORIZON- Adventure Isle ( waited for almost 190 minutes but still worth it, experience flying around the world)ROARING RAPID- Adventure Isle (get wet with water splashes in this ride, suitable for family ride)THE MANY ADVENTURE OF WINNIE THE POOH- Fantasyland (simple train ride but amazingly good)JETPACKS- Tomorrowland (thrilling 360 degree rotation ride)*If possible avoid visiting this place during China holiday such as New Year, Chinese New Year, Qing Ming festival, Labour Day, Dragon boat festival, Mid autumn festival, National Day and Golden Week."
148,3.0,Jul 2019,va ,Long Ride Waits and Rampant Line Cutting,"I visited SHDL twice during my trip to China, once with my tour group and once without.  With my tour group we were only in the park for a couple of hours but were given a couple of fast passes so it made riding some of the more popular rides easier even though they had long wait times.  Unfortunately, when I returned on my own the next day without fast passes, I instantly regretted it.  The wait times after 1:30 pm were exorbitant for the popular rides and all the free fast passes were gone.  The single rider lines don’t function as they should and there is flagrant and rampant line cutting.  In order to maximize your time, you need to get the Premiere ticket or pay for individual fast passes if the free ones are gone.  Otherwise, you’ll spend more time standing in line than riding rides.  If you’re a westerner, try any clothing before you buy it. Clothing sizes in China are different and they don’t sell XXL."

150,1.0,Jul 2019,N/A,Worst Disneyland Park I’ve Visited,"I’ve been to all the Disney parks through the world and this is hands down the worst one I’ve visited. We arrived just when the park opened at 8:30am and it took us over 2 hours to get through the security gates. I’ve never seen such disorganization and it was way too overcrowded. It felt like a prison rather than heading into the happiest place on earth. People were pushing, shoving, yelling and cutting in line. I was whacked in the head and almost lost an eye from all the locals carrying umbrellas. Once we got into that park, all the fast passes were completely taken. We wanted to grab one for soaring, but none were available. So disappointed.The security guards were very rude and the Disney spirit seemed lost at this place. I saw a few people yelling at the employees. Most of the rides had a wait time of over 2 hours. After only being able to ride on 2 rides, We couldn’t take it anymore that we left after just spending 7 hours at the park. This was the absolute worst park I’ve been to and we will not be back. Locals are rude and have no respect for personal space. I almost got pushed over in the line, and was jabbed in the back many times. Stay far away."
151,3.0,Jul 2019,"Beachlands, New Zealand ",Dare I say it.... just a little bit meh 😢,"Following an excruciating one and a half entry process, we entered the park at 9.30am. Seems the huge queues are all in an effort to keep outside food out of the park. As a number of reviews have indicated, the huge entry crowds do dissipate BUT, there are hardly any rides at this park, meaning the top 5 rides are well in excess of 2 hour wait. There are a number of standard Disney rides missing from this park (including it’s a small world). Food is pretty expensive but to be expected. We opted for the Cheesecake shop for lunch / dinner (the meals are HUGE!). Overall the park just seemed to lack the Disney Magic, no characters walking around, inattentive staff, and park features missing the traditional Disney embellishments. Back end of the day is much easier to get into rides - especially during the last parade - queue time into Tron was 15 minute max. Did we enjoy our day, yes. Would we come back? Unfortunately not. "

Bought tickets at the gate, simple, easy, can use overseas card, only waited in line about 2 minutes.

Allow yourself to release your inner child, and experience the enchanted landscape. Need for speed? Get onboard! You won’t be disappointed - take a ride on the super fast Tron - it speeds along loops and curves, it will get the adrenalin pumping.  Need something different - visit the Pirate of the Caribbean ride- you’ll be impressed. Hungry- take your pick-quaint eateries or mega meals, children are extremely well catered for. Make sure you download the Shanghai Disney app- it gives you real time updates on ride queues and wait times. Bag searches & long entry queues so get there early, before 07:30,  but plan to leave after the fireworks around 9:30pm. Easy to get to, bus, train, hotel shuttle or taxi. Expensive momentos, trinkets or keepsakes. Take lots of photos instead- it’s free. Be prepared to walk a lot- the park is huge. Excellent amenities that are sparkling clean. Excellent disabled access with many locations dotted throughout the park to rest and take in the view. Easy to purchase tickets online, probably cheaper too. Avoid visiting the park on national public holidays, it does get a bit crowded. Highly recommend a good translation app is downloaded - it will help you communicate with the locals, unless you speak Chinese/Mandarin. A great experience, the stuff memories are made of."

The only bad thing that came in mind was about the crowd, which is always more than limited exceed. Some ride needed to wait for at least 1hrs-2hrs, or forget about playing it. or you can play it when the park was going to close which could find it has a lesser crowd.Anyways I still love the park."

The rain was pouring down and the crowds were there, but once in the park it was so much fun. The attention to every single detail was amazing! Buy your fast passes - they make the day enjoyable as you are not in lines all day. The best ride was Pirates of the Caribbean x excellent variety and brilliant mix of moving through realistic sets and huge screens. I also enjoyed Soaring over the horizon, even with the slightly annoying introduction.Well worth a day and a great way to triple your move and step goals!The light show was lovely, and the we needed with more rides, the crowds had gone."
164,5.0,Jul 2019,"Shanghai, China, ",Wonderful experience,"We survived the Plumb Rains and the holiday crowds to have a magical day at Shanghai Disney. We wanted to go direct by DiDi, but eventually went by Metro due to the rain. It worked out well. Crowds were not too bad. We’re on the Metro by 7:30 am. Disney was already crowded and it was raining. The long queues are for the security check. Don’t bring glass or food. Look for the lines with the least zig-zag queues. It took forever - close to 1 hour. Got soaked by everyone else’s umbrellas. Inspection was thorough - they opened every zip on my bag. We had bought tickets online, so we’re able to go direct to the entrance counter. You need a form of ID to call your information up - the person who booked the tickets. It was very easy and efficient.Don’t forget to download the Disney App before you go and open an account. It’s a super useful tool for getting free fast passes and also buying them. It also tells you the waiting time of rides, show times, toilets, water fountains etc. the map is great. You do need to plan your day, so that you don’t walk back and forth, although that does depend on what passes you can get.The popular rides often had waiting times of up to 3 hours!!! We applied for free fast passes, but you can only apply once you have your ticket and a bar code. Our first one was for 3:30 pm, after applying at 8:30 am. You can only apply every 2 hours. It got easier to apply during the afternoon. We also “bought” anytime passes for CYN 80 per person, per specific ride. This was SO worth it. Cut our waiting time to about 20 minutes for the rides we went on.Tarzan Show was amazing. Always best to sit in middle, but you can see from anywhere. Pirates of the Caribbean Show was pathetic. All in Chinese with some poor slapstick humor. Not even the locals laughed at much. Tron was great, if you like an adrenaline ride. Glad I went, but not again. One of our party could not fire as they could not fit on the “bike”. Others repeated the ride 3 times. We bought fast passes for this and also free passes - so worth doing that. Very slick and fast operation. Over the Horizon was stunning. Sit in the middle section and front row if possible. Waiting time was insane and the bought passes got us through quickly. It’s a slower operation and longer, so there is some waiting time. We went twice, as we enjoyed it so much. The combination of sight and smell was incredible. Pirates of the Caribbean was the best ride by far. The queue time had dropped by the time we got there, so just joined normal line. Keep to the left lane if open, it somehow went a lot faster. The ride was brilliant - go and see it. We went twice. The first parade was at 12 noon, second at 3 pm - really enjoyed it and it’s nice and slow. Make sure you see it. Went out the park for lunch and supper - Cheesecake Factory - so easy to get to. Share meals - the portions are HUGE and pricey. Free entrance Back in, although you will need to scan your ticket and have your bag searched - NO food. Light and fireworks show was underwhelming for me. Thousands of people looking for a spot with a view. First people queuing at 5 pm for an 8:30 show for the cordoned off area. I think it would be better from closer, so that you can see the water and the lights better. The visuals on the Castle were very clever. Very disappointed on the quality and quantity of the fireworks, but that may be due to Government regulations. 20 minute show - sound system great. BIG tip - instead of rushing home with the crowds after the light show, we went back for two rides - very small queues and so easy. They all close at 10 pm. Better to be here, than queuing at the Metro, or at the taxi rank with the thousands going home. We walked in the rain to the taxi rank - Station D - it’s quite a long walk- in the opposite direction to the Metro. Not sure what time last train leaves. There was a consistent stream of taxis, even though it was so late - 11 pm. To maximize your experience - it would be helpful to plan your day ahead of schedule, although it may need to change depending on conditions in the park on the day.I spent the day looking for an English paper map, without success. Get one early- it’s helpful to see the scale of where you are going."
165,3.0,Jul 2019,"Brisbane, Australia ",Disneyland is great but the crowd is frustrating,"Our expectations were exceeded during our visit here. We purchased a premier access package (basically paid for fast passes) for 3 rides for 180¥ and were able to get one other fast pass. We didn’t line up for the rides with really long lines but still had lots to do. We chose the package with roaring rapids, Tron and buzz’s laser shooting game. This was a good combo and we found Tron the best ride there. Getting in - we arrived in heavy rain and there were no staff guiding you through the security checks or into the park. Here is how I would handle getting into the park - especially when using an overseas credit card.Download the Shanghai Disney app - make sure the phone it’s on can access data in China - we needed this for fast passes and all ride information in the park.Use this appto buy tickets - you will need to bring the passport of the purchaser and ensure that your Passport number is correct as this is how they look you up. Line up through security - this is very slow. Go directly to the entry gate ( or guest services or ticket booths). They look up your tickets there and give you a paper copy.As soon as you enter the park scan your tickets onto the app and get yourself a fast pass and buy the Premier Access tickets - which is strongly recommend.The food was good - but as many others have mentioned in reviews the staff are missing the Disney magic that makes the other parks so happy. We found the crowd frustrating - cramming together and pushing when waiting in lines, smoking all over the park and even a child pooing in the garden with the help of her family - about 50metres from a bathroom! All in all we had a great day and a really glad we went. "
166,5.0,Jun 2019,"Chicago, IL ",A magical day with kids however prepare some $$,"Our family spend a day at park before heading back to States. Which worked out as Disneyland is about 20 mins ride to airport so makes lot of sense logistically to stay in the area.   We have been visiting Orlando Disney world a few time and were very happy with Disney resort and magic hours with hotel guest at Orlando. So spent relatively 5 star hotel price to stay at Toy story resort at Shanghai Disney land to enjoy the downtown Disney the night before and  early magic hour the next day.  Review of Toy story hotel will be in another post but it works pretty much as at other Disney resort. We headed to Disney downtown via the shuttle and enjoyed a very nice dinner. Kids were happy to see fireworks starting at 8:30 from this area. Please note: You must have your phone with data ready or use Disney WIFI around park to order/pay for dinner and further more for next magic day planning. We agreed to hit Tron the first thing tomorrow and get some buzz light year done once we get into part. One thing is different than Orlando that you can NOT choose the fast pass until you are physically in the park. However each of us got a FP from Concierge at hotel when we picked up our park ticket. Didn't know how important that is till next day. The experience of getting into the park was not too bad. Shuttle started at 7:10. We had some expensive ($30) breakfast  consumed while waiting for the long queued shuttle line.  Arrived at 07:40 for a special entry (not main entry) and made into the park before 8AM after two times checking hotel card and ticket and security.   We practically walked on Buzz lightyear with no queue. Then made to Tron after 10 mins and saw a line already however used our hotel cards for fastpass line. My 10 year old chickened out at the last minute. Myself enjoyed the ride tremendously.  The ride was smooth and fast with indoor/outdoor changing combination.  The only thing could be better is to add a loop to have upside down route. But it's fantastic as it is. If you have been on Soaring, Roaring Rapids, and Seven dwarf miner ride at other parks already. Tron is the only one worth using or buying fastpass at this park in my opinion, period.  This ride is coming to Orlando 2021 which makes me really happy. We were able to grab another group of Tron FP once FP was available on Disney App. I didn't realize it was pretty lucky as NONE of FP was available after 9AMish for any ride as they are ALL gone.  The queues for most rids were very long and the single rider line did not work for us which we tried only at seven dwarf minder and stay in line for 20mins but no movement at all.  We also took a 3 hours break back to hotel between 3-6pm before more rides and fireworks. Let's look at rides first: Buzz light year appeared to be my younger one's favorite. So we ended up doing 4 times on this. This ride is pretty entertaining to shoot on Z shape target with laser guns and try to get over to 1 million points.  Pirates of Carrienbean was an awesome ride and was the only one we truly spent the time in queue 35-40 twice.  The ride was a perfect combination of a boat ride under water and IMAX movie experience. The arrangement was pretty flawless to maximize the viewing pleasure and adding some water effect at a surprising place was a big plus. Roaring rapids was slower than I expected. Most of riders were well covered from the water which defeats the fun in my opinion. There was no lines close to 8:30 firework time. It was a great view if you time it right. You could see the fireworks from the boat.  Seven dwarfs miner was not too eventful. Pretty much same as at Orlando. We had one ride then decided to spend time on other places. Between rides, we landed at Tribal Table near roaring rapids for lunch where I was supposed to have the gigantic roasted Turkey legs. They do have turkey legs, however they were just half of the size of what I had before. And seasoning was tailored to Chinese taste which was off... It became a meal with rice and bokchoy. It was good but not impressive. Kids loved pulled pork taco and kids meal with chicken. I guess overall that's a good place to dine. All food and drink here are either at the same price or higher what you would pay at Orlando. In another word, expected expensive. After done three time Tron and re-charged in afternoon, we headed back for more Tron and fireworks. Looking at the waiting time, I purchased a premier access package with about $40 per person for three rides including Tron. Was thinking purchase only Tron or only Soaring for $24 however those RAN out.  All loved the night ride on neon colored Tron motorcycle  and incredible view of the park. Make sure to try that if you can. Different and fancy view from outside portion of this ride assuming you keep your eyes open during this ride. Enjoyed half of the laser and firework show at the castle. Some familiar songs were played in English and some of them in Chinese. We didn't see any shows or sing along as kids not sure if those are in English or Chinese. Finished a wonderful day at Disney town after the fireworks. We were pretty content after a big bowl of Ramen noodle soup at Ippudo. I was pretty grateful the restaurants were all open after 9PM for hungry kids.  My advice for families who have experience Disneyworld somewhere else and enjoy roller coasters is to get on Tron as many time as possible. And suggest to spend the bucks staying at two Disney hotels onsite to maximize the time at the park.  Dine at Disney town with more options. Spend money on premier access early to secure your choice.  Have Fun!"
167,4.0,Jun 2019,"Brisbane, Australia ",Magical experience but be prepared to line,"Definitely one of the best Disneylands outside of the states but of course that means it comes with massive lines. Wait times displayed on the rides were pretty accurate generally 10-15 mins faster which was nice. Download the app so you can receive one free fast pass, which I would recommend you use it on the Tron ride as it's the most popular. Arrive as early as possible as the entry line through security to the entry gates took over an hour. Lastly if you can use the single riders line. Myself and 3 friends managed to skip the 1 hour 30 min wait to get onto a ride in 10 minutes singularly."
168,4.0,Jun 2019,N/A,Stressful but Beautiful Park with Great Rides,"The rides at Shanghai Disney are incredible and so is the theming, but it is quite pressured and not necessarily relaxing or 'magical'. I have visited two other Disney parks and not had this experience. Operating in this park is very stressful. I would say I have travelled quite a bit in China and I think this was the first time I had encountered these kinds of crowds and lack of consideration from some people. Please note this is really the minority of people. Most people I was around were annoyed when someone pushed past them and it resulted in some heated exchanges IN CHINESE and one hilarious one!The experience of getting into the park was very stressful to start. I arrived at 07:30 for an 08:30 opening (on a Friday) and there were already massive ques for bag check and  people cutting the line by pushing, jumping over hedges etc. Due to the length of time, it took to get through bag check, I only actually entered the park at 09:00. Not a very good start to the day. I was able to grab one fast pass for late in the day by the time I got into the park as they had all already run out. You absolutely need to have the internet as if you don't you cannot access any park information or get fast passes through the app. Shanghai Disney resort has internet but you need a Chinese phone number to access it. I do not have one but used a portable modem. The ques for everything were very long (150 minutes+) and the single rider line (which I hoped to use) was not in operation. Not sure why as it was needed. Saying this I still managed to ride Roaring Rapids, Tron, Pirates twice and the storybook boat ride. I concentrated on the rides not in other parks. I walked around the whole park and also saw two shows. I cannot rate the Tarzan show highly enough. My top tip would stay on site so you get early entry and more importantly do not have to enter through the main entrance. I could not afford on site on this trip (unplanned post business trip) but would not go again unless I could."
169,3.0,Jun 2019,N/A,Amazing Rides But..,"I bought my children to Shanghai Disney after HK, Tokyo and really wanted to love it. The rides are simply exceptional- absolutely don't miss Soaring, Pirates of the Caribbean and for those who are not afraid of heights Camp Discovery obstacle course. The rides are the best among the Disneylands we have visited. Highly recommend staying in the Toystory Hotel or Disneyland hotel for the 1 hour early priority entrance before other guests and complimentary fast pass, as queues are very long. Avoid the weekends. However,the people ruin it. Queue cutting, rushing and pushing..absolutely 'destroys' any Disney magic you came for.The crew members were also less smiling, and at times, curt.Put simply, anything that didn't require 'people', they succeeded with this park. Still a great theme park-but only if u go in and expect the unpleasantness of the boorish crowd, and don't let it get to you."

171,4.0,Jun 2019,"Semaphore, Australia ","Spectacular light show, but be prepared for long queues for everything","Highlights - the light show and the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.  Both are just absolutely stunning.   The TRON ride is great fun too, and a slightly different take on the roller-coaster type ride.Was very rare to have less than a 20 minute wait for a ride and by the time I got there (11.30 am) there were no Fastpasses available so I didn't bother with a couple of rides with 2 hour waits.  English isn't the main language but all signage included English and staff I dealt with were fine in communicating - ticket staff are fluent."
172,5.0,Dec 2018,"Liverpool, UK ",Absolutely incredible,"Do not miss Tron, it is amazing, but do take advantage of the single rider queue. Pirates of the Carribean is also not to be missed. Shows are all in Mandarin. Merchandise is expensive as you can imagine, so be prepared to haggle with ladies selling knock-off Minnie ears on the subway ride in if you're looking for a cheap memento!

If you love rollercoasters like me I would recommend the one and only TRON. Fast passes are free but you must go early I would recommend this Disneyland to all Shanghai visitors.
175,5.0,Jun 2019,N/A,Interesting place,You need to spend the whole day to explore this place. Some attractions are long queue but it is worth it. Better go this place on winter. I love winter here rather than summer. 
176,4.0,Jun 2019,"New Delhi, India ",Disney is always fun !!! ,"Disneyland in Shanghai is great if you haven’t been to one in America, as it’s much smaller. But nevertheless it’s great place to take kids and enjoy the Disney adventure with a whole lot of rides and entertainment !! The Disney parade, the shows and plenty of Disney merchandise will keep you busy for 2 days.. it’s an extremely expensive outing as tickets, fast track cards and the food n beverage are really steep! The merchandise is available all over the park and the prices are ruthlessly high! Also the wait for almost all rides ranges from 15-60 minutes and even with fast track pass waiting can be long! If u are a vegetarian, then food options are very less inside the park! Better to eat at places like Starbucks or restaurants that are near the entrance of the park. "
177,4.0,Jun 2019,"Singapore, Singapore ","If you can ignore the behaviour of the locals, you will have a great time.","I have been to the HK and Tokyo Disney so this wasnt so much for me but for my 10 year old boy. To be fair, I read that Shanghai Disney is the largest in the world, also it has the Tron ride which is not available in other Disneylands.Due to the popularity with locals, I think they launched some packages that I have not come across in the HK park. First there is an early access privilege which you have to top up for about 99 yuan. It is limited so if you are an early riser you can go into the park earlier. Also at our hotel, there was a ""guided"" package being sold for 300 yuan which sets off to the park at an unimaginable hour of 5.30/6am. Then there is the app which you have to download but can only activate to apply for fastpass after you enter the park. By the time we got in, the tron ride fastpass was only available for the 6pm ride.So even before you enter the park, there are all these hidden information you need to know which I feel makes the park rather expensive to visit. We went on a weekday, one day before their public holiday but the queue in the morning to get in was already horrendously long. We probably stood in line for close to an hour. Highly suggest you bring drinks and snacks to eat while queuing and finish them before the bag check. My line was checked by an over zealous lady guard who opens up every compartment of our haversack, more careful then the custom officers at airports. Actually I think the whole purpose of denying visitors bringing food and drinks is so that you just have to purchase them in the park. They have ample restaurants and food kiosks but snacks are limited, I was craving for chips but they only have popcorn.After the bag check and the crowd disperse to their desired attractions, we felt better with ample space to roam around. Frankly, the park is well maintained, everything is clean and sparkling. The pirates play is a must watch. Real entertaining with some amazing stunts. We also went for the Stitch show. but everything is in mandarin, so if you dont understand mandarin, skip the stitch show. Buzz lightyear ride was rather lame, good for school children. My husband and son enjoyed the Tron ride. Everything was good until I went to the shops to purchase merchandise and the locals start cutting queue to pay. Just when I thought China has gotten better, they reinforced the image that the people are still not civilised. I told one lady to go to where the queue starts and she actually replied"" who said so"", I was visibly mad. The cashier, aware that I was a foreigner gave me a stitch sticker for consolation and apologised. LOL, as if the sticker makes me feel better. And the fireworks were marvellous of course, but the locals all decided to stand up and ruining the experience. When I went to both HK and Tokyo disney, everyone sat down, making the view clearer for both old and young. So anyway, if you are a Disney fan, or you happened to be in China and decided to go, just beware of all the above. Otherwise I rather recommend you visit the other disney parks."
178,2.0,May 2019,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ",Cut queue and cause injuries and losses. Poor security.,"We went there early in the morning from our hotel in downtown via train. Train was full but as we are moving toward disneyland, the crowd on train reduced. Security check was strict. Weather in may was hot and very sunny. Technology was high tech. Rides were fun and full of surprises. But it's a beautiful place with lots of improvement needed. Beware some of the People visiting this theme park were rude and like to cut queue. Normal cut queue tactics in this park is stick very close to the person in front of you, and once there's a turn, cut in front of the person in front of you like nobody's business.We experienced multiple time of 'unbelievable' cut queue experience.Below are some:1) Use children and baby to cut queue. Example: Was queuing waiting for the ride and suddenly a lady with a child opened and entered through the small gate that separated the front turnstiles and back turnstiles, straight cut in front of us and pretended she was in front of us all the while. Later, all her family did the same too, and joined her in the queue. 2) CLIMB OVER THE WALL TO CUT QUEUE. Two young girls in their teens, climbed over the wall and fences at the soaring over horizon, moving forward from one row to another. We were busy playing games set by Disneyland,and suddenly beside us, the girl climbed over from the row next to us, into our row, and her leg kicked onto us and also the handphone which we hold in our hand before felling onto the floor. No apologies, she straight away stood up and climbed over the opposite wall to the front row. Our handphone cracked!! No security there, or cast members for us to call for help. By the time we reached the entrance of ride, we only able to tell the cast but it's already too late.The parade were beautifully designed and rehearsal. Unfortunately, suggested that disneyland should instruct the front row to sit down so that row behind can view as well. Rather than the first row of people standing up and trying their best to block as much view as possible. Disappointed .. disneyland should be the happiest place, but it wasn't it seems."
179,5.0,Jun 2019,N/A,Fantastic ,This is newly opened in the city of Shanghai. They should adopt more of English rather than chinese speaking  shows as there would ve visitors  across the world and English is easily accessible to everyone and dont miss peter pan's ride.
180,5.0,Oct 2018,"Sydney, Australia, ",Had the best time!,"I took the subway and arrived at the park at 10.15am to find a massive queue and I finally entered the park at 11am. FYI: be prepared for long queues and wait times.This is a great park, it's vast and different enough from the other parks to be interesting.TRON light-cycle was the best ride! The character parades were also very good.If you stay for the fireworks, be prepared to sit and claim your piece of pavement for at least 45 mins before they start and they are worth waiting for.I ended up spending nearly 12 hours here, logging 14kms of walking, and I loved it!Disneytown, outside the park is also good for restaurants and shops."
181,3.0,May 2019,Singapore ,Lacklustre Disney Magic,"Went there on a Weekday (Thursday). Crowd was alright and to be honest very comfortable. I previously braced myself for throngs of people but that only happened at the entrance while queueing to check your bags.Rides were good (Tron a must!) and the wait for the rides can be extremely short if you are lucky! Do note that fast passes can only be obtained using their App which you need to download. If you do not have a local number, do so before heading over if not you will have troubles as they need a one time password which will be sent via text. Food was typical of Disney and something I feared coming into Disneyland was the lack of clean toilets which was something I was very impressed about.However, I would say the overall ""Disney"" experience was slightly underwhelming as compared to other parks I've been to. The music was not playing loud enough and cast member which I met were mostly impatient and rude. On some rides, they seem super annoyed and I was taken aback by that as this should not be the case. If you are first timer, this Disneyland may not be the best first time experience for you!  I would say go for the rides and ignore the other shortfalls of the park since it might be new."

Overall though very good and ticket prices are very cheap compared to other Disney parks.
184,4.0,May 2019,"Orange, Australia ",Better Than Expected,We were staying at the Pullman Jing an and we caught a taxi which cost 120Y and took approx half an hour.  As soon as we entered the park we scanned our tickets onto the disney app and i purchased the fast pass package as we were there only one day and didnt want to waste time waiting in line.  We had an enjoyable day and the crowds were bearable.  My biggest complaint was i purchased the photo pass and we ended up with one photo. We got the photo from Tron and when i questioned the photo from Buzz light year i was told it wasnt working! It was difficult scanning photos onto your phone. It was hard to tell if it worked or not.  There wasnt any photographers around the park either. So i bought the photo pass for one photo!!! The park was very clean!  Also quite expensive. Overall we did enjoy our day!This Disneyland is the last one i needed to go to as i have now been to all of them!!!
185,4.0,Apr 2019,"Myrtle Beach, SC ",Shanghai Disneyland,My wife and I visited Shanghai Disney on April 18 2019. We took a taxi from downtown Shanghai along the Bund for 120 yuan ( less than $20 ) we had our hotel get us our taxi rather than flag one ourselves. Everything in China was a bargain. The park is huge which gives you room to breath and relax. Not as many ride attractions as other parks but the technology of the rides is far superior and if you haven’t experienced it you will be absolutely amazed. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride is unbelievable. If you go left from Main Street there is a exit where you can go to the Disney shops and restaurants outside the park and then re-enter into the park at the same spot. There is a Cheesecake Factory outside the park here and we recommend it. The only negative was the wait times for rides. We also visited the main hotel on property which has some beautiful photo spots.

We have visited Disneyland in California and Florida numerous times and felt that Shanghai was beautiful, well kept and very clean.  Although the property is large, there aren’t as many attractions as the US locations but they had many different ones including TRON which our kids loved.We downloaded the app so we could use the fast pass which was convenient. They also had a guest service kiosk in each land which we appreciated as we had an issue with a fast pass and they were very helpful in assisting us. We purchased our tickets online prior to arriving. The purchaser will need to bring their passport to pick up tickets."
189,4.0,May 2019,"Montreal, Canada ",Well worth the visit ,"Recently visited Shanghai Disney while on a business trip to Shanghai. The entry fee  is far more reasonable than its US counterparts. The park is quite large and beautifully kept; it never felt crowded despite the number of people. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride is amazing, we were able to ride it twice. There is also a live Pirates show that despite being difficult to follow due to the language, had some pretty cool special effects. The Tron roller coaster was also a really fun ride. As a foreign visitor make sure to bring cash as all of the smaller snack vendors don’t take credit; only cash or WeChat pay. Food favours local cuisine and is quite expensive. There are some western offerings like Mickey pizza and burgers. I had the pizza... it wasn’t great.  The evening show and fireworks is spectacular and there is so much room to watch it you don’t feel crowded. Retail stores are a little small... this is where you do experience the crowds and space constraints much like other Disney stores.  If you like Disney and have a day to kill while in Shanghai... I recommend visiting Disney Shanghai.  "

193,4.0,May 2019,"San Francisco, CA ",Last Disney park to visit!,"Shanghai Disney was my last Disney park to complete my visit of all Disney parks around the world. I visited the park solo on a Friday in May. My observations as a U.S. visitor:- Getting to the park for rope drop did not help. Everyone else has the same idea and people start sprinting the second they get off the metro and there's a good distance between the metro and the park entrance.- The line to get through security was aggressive - pushing and cutting seemed completely normal.- Fast passes run out quickly - was there at rope drop and the first fast pass I could get was 2:30 pm. I could only get one other during the day.- Single rider lines are terribly inefficient - it seemed faster to wait in the regular line.- You know when there's that one person that is not paying attention and doesn't move up in line for a minute? At Shanghai Disney, there will not be a moment of hesitation for the people behind you to fill that space. If you leave any space between you and the person in front of you, expect it to be filled.- Shanghai's version of Pirates is as amazing as everyone says. Tron was lots of fun too. Soarin' is very popular and consistently had a 120 min. wait throughout the day.- Food and merchandise is as expensive as the U.S. parks. - Most park merchandise is also sold in the World of Disney at their version of Downtown Disney, but is not sold at the Disney Store in downtown Shanghai. There did not seem to be an airport Disney Store like Hong Kong either."

If you ever have the concern on the hygiene of the restroom, it is very clean and comfort! and i dont have to Q to wait for one! We spent 2 days here during weekdays / non public holiday. hence we had a good time and really enjoy. We will definitely revisit here!"

196,5.0,May 2019,"Townsville, Australia ",Quality you expect from a Disneyland Park,"Shanghai Disneyland is a fantastic family holiday destination. The park itself is only 3 years old. Everything is so well maintained and looked after. Plenty of restaurant options, and places to sit. Staff / guest services everywhere  to assist. The Disney Castle is amazing.We spent 3 days in the park. It’s very spread out. Plenty of rides for all ages. Signage around park is in English. Very little English spoken on rides or subtitles. Helps to know a few key words in Simple Chinese.Wait times can be extensive. Get in early, or last thing of a night for shorter wait times. We had a fast pass and it made our experience so much better."
197,3.0,May 2019,"Salt Lake City, UT ",A-MAZE-ing lines,"Disney is the master of hiding the actual length on lines with twists and turns but I was A-MAZED at the Shanghai Pirates of the Caribbean.  I felt like a rat in a maze and that was on a rainy, windy MONDAY morning.  Be prepared to wait and remember that the Western concept of lining up means nothing in China.  Guard your position in line and don't be offended or flattered  if someone presses up against you line,,,it is nothing personal."
198,4.0,May 2019,"Trappe, PA ",A beautiful park with lots of different attractions for all ages.,"This is a typical beautiful Disney Park with expansive walkways, flowers, manicured lawns, and clean streets. Some of the rides are unique to this park such as TRON and a revised Pirates of the Caribbean. The food in the park was awful but Disney Town, adjacent to the park, had great places to eat such as Wolfgang Puck and the Cheesecake factory. Don'r go on Sundays as the park is mobbed."
199,3.0,Mar 2019,St. Thomas ,Somethings differ greatly from the U.S.,"This is my fifth Disney Park visited and while I am biased towards the U.S. Parks, I did think this Disneyland was better than the one in Hong Kong when it came to the variety of rides. Lots of original ones like the fun obstacle course (you have to wear actual harnesses) and the Princess ride that goes under Cinderella Castle. And this Park also has more of the classics, like The Pirates and the Caribbean and Snow White’s Mine Cart. A downside for us was that the live shows were all in Chinese so we couldn’t understand them. Another thing that really bothered me is witnessing in two different lines, parents pulling out urine funnels and bottles and having their young children pee in them!! It was so gross, especially because the lines were really not that long (under one hour) so why couldn’t they just take their toddlers to the bathroom before standing in line like reasonable parents do? No one wants to stand behind you in line with your bottle of urine in your backpack or worse, watching you pour it out while people are standing behind you. Disney needs to really discourage this practice. I had heard about it in Hong Kong before visiting Shanghai Disneyland but didn’t actually believe it until I witnessed it twice in one afternoon!"
200,4.0,May 2019,"Richmond, VA ",A solid Disney experience,"A solid Disney experience, that is made better with just a few tips.  First, overall a Castle Park experience that will feel very familiar to you. Although several of the classics are not present, there are enough unique things to balance that out a bit.  The park is large, and when were there it was clean and reasonably efficient despite occasional periods of crowding.  If you statin a resort hotel, you can enter the park one hour early - in that time you can hit at least three, and maybe 4 of the most popular rides with no lines and no waiting. Combined with some assiduous fastness strategy you may not wait in a line until lunchtime.  Second tip - you can purchase a fastness package and not wait in any lines at any time. It's not worth it on a low-crowd day, but worth every penny if it is busy.  The concierge packages also include preferred seating for the parade and the evening lights and fireworks spectacular. Again - if you are willing to stake your spots out early and wait this is not necessary, but being on the front row without any anxiety was good for me.  Others have noted that there is maybe not as much ""Disney Spirit"" here as at other parks, but that is a quibble.  Where I was disappointed was in the quality of the food.  Maybe step out to DisneyTown for your meals."
201,2.0,May 2019,"Qimei, Penghu ",Nice looking park and incredible long lineups,"I have been to every single Disneyland/Disneyworld parks except for the Japan ones. And obviously this is a personal opinion of this park. Comparing to the other parks I have been to, the Shanghai Disneyland park was disappointing. The park itself was nice. The center piece, The Castle, was beautiful. There were many photo angles to take either photo or selfies that will give you amazing shots of the castle. The rides in the park were disappointing. This was the worst part of the park. The lines were amazingly line, the longest wait for a ride throughout my 2 days there was 180 minutes (Soaring over the Horizon). That is 3 full hours to ride the ride once! On top of that, the feeling I had with the rides i've been on is that most rides are a lot shorter than similar rides in the other Disneyland parks. TRON took 90mins to line-up and the ride itself felt like it was 30 seconds or so and with the ride being very tamed. I mean it was cool to ride a coaster in the motorcycle sitting position, but other than that it wasn't anything special. Fast passes were gone ridiculously early. Park opened at 830am, and by 930am the fast passes were basically all gone for the day, except for buzz lightyear's ride (which usually is only less than 10mins if you lined up anyways).  The park is very clean. 90% of the rides are in Chinese (so as a non-Chinese you would almost understand nothing) most of the staff know basic English so that was good. However, I felt like 1/2 the staff in the park didn't carry the Disneyland spirit. Half of them looked like they didn't even want to work there. This park is definitely a 1day park if the lines weren't so long. Many of the rides were very disappointing (for example the Voyage to the Crystal Grotto) and you know what I mean once you have been on it. It is such a waste of time. This kind of ride should not be a ""Disney attraction"". There is no imagination or creativeness to it. My final thought:  If I have a choice I would absolutely visit any other Disneyland park rather than this Shanghai one. It's big, but it's disappointing. Even the one in Hong Kong was better. If this is a destination you can't miss, then plan accordingly, make sure you go on the Pirates of the Carribean ride and TRON (for the new-idea factor)."
202,5.0,Jun 2018,N/A,Halal Food in Shanghai Disneyland,"Food at Shanghai Disneyland theme park and hotel are absolutely NOT HALAL. This has been confirmed by the Shanghai Disneyland itself via its official website. However, there is one halal restaurant adjacent to this Disneyland theme park in Disneytown.This Disneytown location is right next to the Disneyland theme park and is the main entrance into the theme park for overnight visitors at Disneyland's official hotel, either at the Shanghai Disneyland Hotel or Toy Story Hotel. So, if you stay in one of these hotels, then you do not have to queue up at Disneyland's main door where all the people will get in the door!There are Disney's dining outlets like Starbucks Coffee, BreadTalk, The Cheesecake Factory, Toast Box, and more. And for halal food, you need to find the Food Republic (a covered food court). Food Republic's location is quite difficult, far and away. But for the sake of halal food, everything can be found!Do not be surprised if you go into this Food Republic for being filled with humans! Yeah, there are a lot of people eating at this Food Republic because it is a bit pricey compared to other restaurants.Inside the Food Republic, there are many eateries and the only halal restaurant is the Yershari Restaurant. The Yershari Restaurant is a relatively popular halal chain of shops in Shanghai and many of its branches are located in Shanghai.Yershari Restaurant is famous for its soft and juicy goat satay. As long as we ate at the store, did not break visitors to buy a goat satay. And we did not miss to feel it and it was good!Transactions within the Food Republic are cashless, so visitors are forced to buy a cashless card first before making a purchase. The card can be purchased at the Service Counter, which is right next to Yershari Restaurant. The minimum price for this card is RMB100 and the balance can be refunded.My opinion, the price is very reasonable with its many and delicious meals. No need to think about the price because this is the only halal food in Shanghai Disneyland!"
203,5.0,Apr 2019,N/A,Early Bird Catches the Worm,"I loved this place from the very second we arrived at the trop off (we took a taxi). I sang along the music and saw Disney characters. Come early in the morning, when the park opens! There were no lines even though we visited during Chinese Labour Holiday (and everywhere in Shanghai was full of tourists). We were expecting two hour lines at the entrance but there was none. Around noon the place was already full. So really, come when the park opens. The longest line to a ride was two hours, but there were many rides with 30 minutes lines or less.There were a lot of families of course but we (adults) fit in great. The food at the park is very Chinese, burger place is in the West of the Disneyland.Vegetarian food was nonexistent. All the songs and rides are in Chinese , the staff doesn't speak English.I recommend taking a taxi and not your own car. There were huge lines of cars to the parking lot but with a taxi you can skip. Taking a taxi in the evening was also easy."

It's an hour out of town and has very few of the standard rides.  We were really looking forward to the day but found excessively long ques, poor food choices, and only really little kids rides.  If you are there Tron is worth the wait as is pirates of the Caribbean but for the price, the lines and effort, there is so much more to enjoy in Shanghai."

Also the price was much cheap than official website and less waiting time！At the beginning I was trying to do everything by myself. However it’s so hard for us to use the Official App  to get fast pass! Cause we don’t have local phone number!! After we download the app the only thing we can use is to see the wait time for all attractions.Most of the Disney staff can not speak english. They are very friendly but can’t understand your request.

207,4.0,May 2019,"England, UK ",Best & worst day in one,"Be prepared for a long detailed review from a Disney addict that has been to 5/6 Disney parks. We visited shanghai Disney on a Wednesday. We purchased our tickets online before hand and arrived via taxi from our hotel in Shanghai.  When buying our tickets we had to enter our passport details and bring the passports with us to gain entry. As advised by our hotel concierge we arrived over an hour before opening (7:20 for 8:30 opening). Having been to Disney world in Florida 35+ times I thought this was excessive but took the local advice and I’m so glad we did. Upon arrival we got in a line for bag check. This was the worst part of our day. We waited in line (term used loosely) until 8:35. During this time we were pushed and shoved from every angle and people were blatantly queue jumping at every given opportunity. I think by the time we reached the front we were around 30 people behind the family we originally started behind!Once we got through bag check we got in another line to the entrance turnstiles where you show the passport and they print your ticket. We waited in this line around 20 minutes and it wasn’t as pushy as the first line. Frustratingly when we got to the front we learned I had messed up and booked the tickets for the day before..! Completely my fault but we then had to go to another line and get it sorted. Once sorted we entered the park at 09:15 and attempted to sort out fastpases on the app. The WiFi in the park was rubbish. You have to enter your mobile number and get sent a code to put in. Unfortunately the WiFi never accepted the code so we ended up having to use mobile data to book them.At 09:20 the first fastpass available was for 19:10!!! We could only book one fastpass and the next fastpass could be booked at 11:20 however when we tried at this time all passed for the day had gone!If you want to buy fastpasses they’re 150¥ per ride per person so we didn’t bother. We decided as we had done a lot of the rides in other parks we would try and do the ones we hadn’t done. Having got the 19:10 fastpass for Tron we headed to pirates of the Caribbean. We waited around 65 minutes and WOW was it worth it.  We were fortunate to get the front row of the boat and I think this made it even better. The ride is nothing like POC in any of the other parks and is absolutely INCREDIBLE. I won’t ruin it but if you’re visiting this is an absolute must do!Once we had done we grabbed some late breakfast at the patisserie. The water in this park is much cheaper than any others but the food was really expensive (you’re also not allowed to take any of your own food into the park although we did witness a lot of Chinese people in the line that morning hiding food up their jumpers!) We paid around £30 for 2 ham and cheese toasted sandwiches and 2 cakes!!After a quick food stop we headed to Tron seeing as our fastpass was for 19:10 when we would want to be getting a space for fireworks. When we got there we noticed lockers before the queue entrance. We tried to put our bags in but couldn’t pay via MasterCard so proceeded to the shop to ask for a coupon. It was here the so lady told us we could take our bags as there was places to put them when you got on the ride! This really wasn’t clear with signage and the presence of the lockers made us feel you had to use them!The wait for Tron was 75 minutes. This wait was horrendous. We had a family behind us who stood so close they were touching us at all times. It seems the Chinese don’t have the same sense of space as westerners, at one point one of them turned and coughed right on me it was quite disgusting. In the end I had to let them ahead of us as I was getting severely claustrophobic and verging on bursting into tears (I wouldn’t usually class myself as claustrophobic). Luckily the family behind us were a little bit more distanced!When we got to the front it paid to have let the family ahead of us as again we got the front row! Again this ride is nothing like any of the other parks and was fantastic! A must for anyone who enjoys rollercoasters!After Tron we went on buzz which was slightly better than Florida but similar concept. Soarin had a 200+ minute wait time all day so we gave that a miss as I read it’s the same as Florida except for showing the Shanghai park at the end. Other smaller fantasyland rides also had 200 minute lines so we decided to take a break and walk around Disney town. The Minnie Ears in shanghai are 126¥ (£14) compared to around £22 in Florida so I stocked up on a few pairs! Whilst in dosneytown we ate at the Cheesecake Factory which was lovely. Then headed back to the park. We decided we weren’t going to wait for 200+ minutes for rides we had experienced in other parks so we waited again for POC and then spent time just wandering the park and the shops as all the lines were huge!At 18:00 we headed to the front of the park and we’re shocked that there were loads of people already sat for the 20:30 fireworks. We decided to sit further back so not to get shoved. We found a spot just to the left (as you’re facing the castle) before the bridge. We positioned ourselves in front of the railings with a small lake in front so that nobody could get in front of us. I’d recommend this spot (will add a photo of the view) but be prepared to spread out your bags etc as the closer it gets to the start more and more people arrive and you end up getting squashed in.  The fireworks weren’t anywhere near as good as Florida and the story was in Chinese so hard for us to follow. Overall, based on the rides I’d say this is probably my favourite Disney park we have been to (have been to all except LA). I did however find the day stressful and uncomfortable in comparison to the relaxed happy feeling you get in other parks. We also only did 3 different rides due to the insane wait times. During the day we saw only 5 other western people which was fine however a lot of the Chinese were taking “sly” videos and photos of us and the children were pointing and laughing which was somewhat awkward and the parents didn’t seem to tell them to stop. Apologies for the long review - I hope this review helps others to plan and enjoy their day!"

Its was day off in China, so many people comes to the park. The worst Disney. How can you lend people pay around 100 dollars ticket by person and then only you can enter in 3 attraction from morning to night, because there was a line of people of 2,3 and almost 4 hours!!! in each one!!. Its a scam, a real ROBBERY. You take advantage of the Chinese people on their day off. It is a shame, you only think about money, instead of limiting the tickets, so that the people who come in can enjoy and not suffer. Owners of the park are thieves and I hope someday thinking about it, that it is inhuman what they do. "
210,5.0,May 2019,"Nairobi, Kenya ",Perfect spot with lots of kids activities ,You definitely need to buy the tickets way early. When you get in try to get the fast tickets for the rides that really have a long wait time. Check height recommendation if you traveling with toddlers. Best place to eat is at the Disney town and try blue frog restaurant it never disappoints thou the wait time is long too the manager  Flora-was awesome .Choose to arrive early the lines build up as the day goes by  esp the dwarf has liken over 150!min wait time so start there first .Catch the shows anytime .Definitely worth visiting. 
211,3.0,May 2019,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ",Avoid Visiting on Labour Day Holidays,"There is an absolute lack of information on english language websites to warn against visiting Shanghai Disneyland over the Labour Day holidays which might possibly be as bad as the National Day holidays. I've actually done my research before booking for this trip but it turned out to be a mistake. Shanghai Disneyland was great with its beautiful landscaping, new state of the art rides and did its best in bringing out the magic of Disney. (Personally loved TRON and Pirates of the Caribbean!) That being said, visiting on a holiday week (in this case, between 2 - 3 May and apparently it changes depending on what day 1 May falls on) proved to be a terrible mistake as tens of thousands of local tourist flooded in from as early as 5am to 6am every single day.Main attractions have wait times up to 220 min throughout the day and with this amount of people in the park at the same time, you'd experience the worst that humanity has to offer with endless pushing and shoving happening in lines and people who give no regard to lining up and respect for personal space. This happens throughout your 2 - 3 hours wait. You can throw EVERY Disneyland hacks you read online out of the window at this point. It's a game of sheer numbers. I've seen reviewers questioning the vast spaces in the park. Well, here's your answer. Benches and sidewalks between worlds are filled with people resting and sitting on sidewalks. Other than that, it's also a whole lot of waiting for cafes, restaurants and toilets. And waiting in such conditions really just sucks the magic out of anything.With no regard to others, visitors here will do anything to get in line or the best views. So expect your lines being cut for rides and your view being blocked either by selfie sticks, kids on parents. I observed that Disney has done all it can to expedite lines and hiring tonnes of workers to pick up rubbish the moment it lands on the ground and clean up mess within minutes. But ultimately, it's the people themselves who make the experiences and there's nothing the park management can do to overcome the lack of civility of a mass of humans this large.Other folks seem to have a great time off-peak and it certainly looks possible for it to be an amazing experience with half the amount of people there is over the de holidays.So just visit off-peak."
212,4.0,Apr 2019,"Hong Kong, China ",Better than Hong Kong's one,"The major problem about this Disneyland is too crowded, even on a weekend that is not a national holiday in China. China people are so craving for Disney!!!  It's suggested to arrive at the theme park by 7:30 and start to queue up till its opening at 8:30. It doubles the size of Hong Kong's one but the admission fee is cheaper.  The so-called ""fastpass"" is basically useless that you could hardly play all the attractions. Kindly be reminded of getting the fastpass for those you are interested most. There are free drinking water facilities, so don't worry about it. One-day allows to re-enter the park. There are more restaurants to choose at the street outside the park. "
213,4.0,Apr 2019,N/A,"A truly beautiful park but quite different from DisneyWorld, Orlando","This is a beautiful well landscaped park. Some new rides found nowhere else are TRON and the version of Pirates of the Caribbean, both attractions that are a ""must see"". Fewer gift shops and small sizes for sweat shirts and T-shirts. Don't bother looking for XL, they don't exist. Food choices abound in Disney Town. The cheesecake factory was not busy and wonderful food. The park is exceptionally crowded on Sundays. Go early on Saturday and hop on rides. Lots of walking between attractions so wear comfortable shoes. Stay in the Disney Hotel as others need shuttles to get to the park. The Courtyard Marriott is nearby but requires a shuttle bus to get to the park. Reasonable admission prices abound."

It is reasonably new and still has plenty more planned. It has all the usual attractions and is well laid out and the wait time for rides is reasonable. The Pirates of the Caribbean was still fun in Mandarin. The easiest way to get there in chaotic Shanghai was by metro train and cheap (only about $4 each one way ) Entry price was cheaper than all the others as well. We went on a school holiday Saturday and whilst it was busy it was not packed. "
215,3.0,Apr 2019,"Singapore, Singapore ",Not a place for thrill seekers ,"We finally made it to shanghai disney after all these years. We dropped off at mickey avenue car park, from there it was a loong walk to the entrance. It’s got to be more than 1km at least. We did not have a stroller with us so this was really a long distance for us. It was a Thursday so understandably there were lesser people. (But inside was packed with people). We arrived around 1130 and managed to clear security in 10 minutes. I heard that food is not allowed but we were waved off since we had a kid in tow. My last disney experience was more than 10 years ago but i recall staff to be really friendly, not quite here. They weren’t rude, so was smiley. Probably a cultural thing. The park was 90% local so understandably food options were mostly chinese. I was surprised they didn’t forget about southeast asia. I managed to try their laksa over lunch at Mickey and Pals. It wasn’t too bad. If you’re thinking about bringing your own water, the resort sells a 500ml for 10 rmb each. The snacks were average but the popcorn smell really awesome.The biggest problem were the wait times for the rides. I really can’t do waiting more than 1 hr for a ride anymore. Problem was.. the rides were really not exciting. I went as a single rider to the Seven Dwarfs mine.. thankfully i got a seat within 20minutes.. because i would have swore if it took an hour to sit to this boring ride. I tried to do fast pass but apparently i needed a local number to validate (what?!). I was on roaming so i gave up. If you have kids, forget about dumbo and carousel, the wait times are not worth it. Go to shanghai zoo.. zero queue! Ah and smoking! Though there were designated smoking areas, people still smoked as they wish though it isn’t as prevalent as before. Disney should really police this better.In conclusion, if it wasn’t because we were brought in by a friend, i wouldn’t have paid on my own to enter. "
216,4.0,Apr 2019,"London, UK ",Best park so far but needs to improve the disabled policy,"The park is great and the system of two check points with photo id is great to avoid queue jumping, but the lack of sensibility when they face a disabled person is flagrant. I was stopped twice by very rude security agents demanding to leave my mobility scooter as they assumed I wasn't ill and could walk normally. I also had to rent the mobility scooter out of the park as they don't offer them like the other disney parks. The staff should improve their English skills."

The rides are more for young kids and even Tron is ok without being too scary. Tron and Pirates both ok but many of the rides were lame. Be prepared to queue sometimes 2 hours and i would not visit this park on a weekend.One thing i did not understand is how there were some people let into the park who were selling unofficial Disney merchandise. Crazy as they search your bags when you enter the park but they still let these people in.Food was expensive here but if you casn eat at the restaraunt inside Pirates of the Carribean as you see the boats go by or the Restaraunt by Tron.DisneyTown is a waste of time but we did go there to starbucks to charge our phone batteries as there is no where in Disneyland to charge your batteries.Disney is a long day so it is not a must but if you have kids it is a good day

However, it turned out that I was wrong and I had such a great time. Spent 2.5 days there and I felt that it wasn't enough! People were all generally well-mannered and not rowdy, no pushing and no cutting of queues. The app made it super easy to get fast passes, instead of having to physically walk to the ride to scan your ticket to get the fast pass.

221,4.0,Apr 2019,"Sydney, Australia ",Fun and enjoyable visit,"We visited Disneyland with 2 young children on 2 day passes. As we visited on a weekend, we had expected crowds and long queues. Luckily we were staying at the Toy Story hotel and were able to get early entry into Disneyland. That allowed us to get a fast pass and complete 1-2 rides(with no/little wait times) before the crowds arrive. I find the Disneyland app really useful in finding out the wait times for each ride. This helps to decide which ride/attraction to go for next. We only managed to get 1 fast pass per day as they ran out quickly and we can only request for another fast pass closer to the time for the current one. Some things we learned:1) have lots of patience, especially when the park is crowded with long queues2) have a plan of the rides/attractions that you want to do beforehand and do those first3) if possible, buy an early entry ticket or stay at a hotel within the Disneyland resort4) the popular fast pass attractions are: Tron, Soaring over the horizon and seven dwarfs mine train.5) the longest queues for non fast pass rides(for the 2 days when we were there) are Dumbo and Storybook courtWe find the park and toilets clean. Drinking water is available for you to refill your water bottles. Food is ok with both Asian and western selections. If you have time, a good option is to have your meals in Disneytown just next to the park.  Overall, we enjoyed ourselves, more so the kids as it was their first time to Disneyland."

223,1.0,Apr 2019,"Shanghai, China ",The Most Unmagical Place on Earth,"Shanghai has so many amazing things to offer an international traveller - Shanghai Disney isn’t one of them. At best, the staff of this theme park is indifferent to Westerners; at worst, hostile. The Disney smile, a staple of the franchise in other parks, is a rare thing here. In fact, the staff seem to be terribly unhappy here. The are generally unhelpful and typically rude to foreigners. For all Shanghai’s history of embracing the West, its Disneyland - a foreign import - is not a place in which English-speaking people will feel comfortable.But surely the theme park rides makes up for the ungracious manner of park employees. We went on two rides and spent over three hours in line for each of these. The queues are long for all rides, the wait times horrendous and the environment sterile in places. Save your money and go to Disney Sea in Tokyo. Not only will you spend far less time in queues but your overall experience will be far more pleasant.  And you won’t have to walk over a kilometre from the car park to Mickey Avenue.Avoid at all costs."

225,4.0,Apr 2019,"Shanghai, China ",Springtime magic! ,"Disneyland Shanghai was my first ever Disneyland visit and it was (almost) everything I hoped it would be. It's clean, the rides are decent and everything is shiny Disney. Of course everything costs a lot of money and food can be pretty pricey. Plan ahead, be smart with fastpass and stay hydrated. Tips:1. Get there as early as you possibly can. The crowds are insane and take time to clear security.2. Have the app downloaded and ready. The wifi at the park is unreliable. Forget fastpass unless you have a functional app.3. Fastpasses sell out near instantaneously, so make sure you grab one immediately upon entering the park.4. If you want a half decent spot to see the closing fireworks, you'll want to grab a seat by 6.30.5. Absolutely no charging ports anywhere and you'll definitely need your phone, so carry a portable charger.6. The app has accurate wait times for all rides. Plan your day carefully. Rides like Pirates and Tron deserve two goes at least.7. Book return tickets for your metro ride back in the morning to skip the long lines.8. Prepare to queue for everything.9. Snacks are pricey, but the meal for 4 at the Tangled tavern is a great deal for 288 yuan.10. If you're getting a drink, get Gatorade. Dehydration is a real risk because you'll be walking a lot. "

228,4.0,Apr 2019,"Bengaluru, India ",The Most Magical Place in Shanghai!,"During our short stay in Shanghai, we promised our 5yo that we would go to Disney since she had been a great kid during our 2 week China tour.  We were not disappointed!We found the park to be very similar to what we had come to expect from visiting Disney Orlando, USA. Clean park, great rides, expensive food and long lines.  Despite the last two points, we had a magical experience.We arrived around 10am and stayed until park closure at 830pm.  We hit most of the park, though i think one could easily spend two days here to not miss a thing.We did find the fast pass less efficient than the US parks.  In the end, we only snagged one.  The rest we rode standby. Pirates was my favorite.  Quite an upgrade from its older sister in Orlando.  My husband rode Tron and said it was amazing.  Our daughter is a huge fan of the Mine Train and Winnie the Pooh.Disneytown is outside the park, but has easy exit and reentry.  We ate at The Cheesecake Factory which reminded us of home.All in all, a wonderful time.  Can't wait to come back again real soon!"
229,3.0,Jan 2019,N/A,Great Shanghai experience !,"It is just amazing, perhaps next trip we should spend at lease 2 days to explore thoroughly, one day is just not enough due to long Que at almost every park that take easily 30 minutes to 3 hours...!    "
230,4.0,Apr 2019,"Sydney, Australia ",I like this park,Obviously it’s china the plants and flowers are amazing.  The animation is great the visuals extra special.  I did think that for locals it was very expensive to get in and even more expensive to have a meal in one of the many many restaurants. But go.  Rides are great. Trim. Pirates of the Caribbean.  All amazing
231,4.0,Apr 2019,"Singapore, Singapore ","Nice, clean and orderly","Reach there when the park just opened. Security clearance was smooth. They allow you to bring your selfie stick but you cannot use inside. Purchase of tickets was abit confusing as the signage was not very clear + one staff was pointing one direction and another was pointing at a different direction. You must produce your ID when purchasing the tickets. I am not sure why is there a need as other Disneyland in Japan and Hong Kong do not need. The park is big and clean. I went on a Wednesday, there's not much crowd but for a decent ride, i still have to wait about 50mins to an hour for it. And the ride is only for about 1 min. The toilet is well maintain and clean. Had my lunch earlier to avoid the crowd and food was good. The 'foodcourt' is spacious and ordering the food is like Ikea, where you order what you want first and move to the payment counter to make payment. However, their photo apps doesn't work for me. I queued to take photos with the Disney character and gave the photographer my tickets to scan the QR code on it. When i try to download it through the Disneyland photo apps, it kept saying i have got to photo to downloads. So, still better trust your own phone to take the photo rather than depends on others.Did not manage to stay longer to see the fireworks.Overall, it is a big and nice park with plenty of rides. But for me, once is enough."
232,4.0,Apr 2019,"Boston, MA ",Disney is Disney everywhere,"We really appreciated how Disney truly is Disney everywhere. In a land where we did not speak the language it was really fun to go to this familiar location and spend a day at another premier Disney park. About a 30 minute car ride outside of downtown Shanghai. Easy to do as a day trip from your hotel. Favorite rides - Tron, Pirates of  The Caribbean, and Soaring."
233,4.0,Apr 2019,"Renton, WA ",This is probably our 3rd favorite park of all the Disney theme parks!,"LONG post with lots of information!We have visited all of the other Disney theme parks in the world and this was our last one. We stayed at Toy Story Hotel so we were able to buy our tickets (with our photos on it) from the concierge and we didn't need to show our passports entering the park. We also had an hour early entry to the park which meant we didn't have to stand in a long line to get in.We were at the park at 7:20 after taking the shuttle from the hotel. At 7:30am, the park was open to us and we went directly to Tron. That is by far the best ride in the park and one of the best roller coasters Disney has. In fact, it is the fastest roller coaster in all the Disney theme parks. We chose Tron in the evening as our extra fast pass (for staying at the hotel) and it is even better than in the day! Try to get one of the bikes in the front.For the first hour, there wasn't a line for anything and we could get fast passes on our app so we chose Soaring. We were able to ride Tron twice, the Seven Dwarves mine ride (over hyped as it felt like a kid's version of Big Thunder), Pirates (excellent update of the Yo Ho Pirates everywhere else!) and Peter Pan. We could also have ridden Winnie the Pooh and Rapids (other popular rides) but we weren't really interested in those. Soaring is exactly the same as we have ridden in other parks other than Shanghai being shown at the end rather than Disneyland, so I don't really know why there was a 2 hour line. Buzz Lightyear is updated with better working lasers and targets! The castle is the biggest one of all the parks and it is really interesting to be able to walk inside.We didn't eat much in Disneyland other than a waffle and lavender ice cream set. Popcorn stalls open late (around 10am?) and close early which is strange so we didn't get to try any. Their buckets are definitely not as collectible as those at Tokyo Disneyland.We didn't stay for any parades or fireworks as my son was recovering from a cold. The one thing we missed out on that we wished we had done was the ropes course adventure land. The line was long (it wasn't open during the early opening) and I am not sure my son could have done it anyway. Of all the park we have visited, we rank this one after Disney World (multiple parks in one area) and Tokyo Disneysea. Tron and Pirates really puts this one up there but I read that Tron is heading to Disney World so maybe it won't be so special after that. This Disneyland is missing It's a Small World and Haunted Mansion which are staples and should be included.We were going to go for 2 days but after one day, we were satisfied and spent the second day sightseeing Shanghai instead. The early entry definitely helped with that because we were able to ride whatever we wanted and had 5 fast passes during the day for everything else. I would totally recommend staying at a Disney hotel if you can afford it."
234,5.0,Mar 2019,N/A,VIP tour is the way to go...unless it's raining,"We loved Shanghai Disney! We spent two days in the park. I had booked a VIP tour (my first time ever and we are avid Disney goers) for our first day, reading and hearing all the horror stories of the unimaginable long lines but when I looked at the weather it showed it was going to rain all day. Not wanting to waste my money on a rainy day, I changed it to the following day and decided to try and wing it bad weather and all.The lines were surprisingly short and fast. We pretty much rode 3/4 of the park with hardly any wait time. The next day the weather was beautiful, but thinking of the crowds the day before, I was worried I wasted my money on the VIP tour. Boy was I wrong!! The lines were insane. Thank goodness we purchased the tour (very reasonably priced considering what you would pay at the other parks). We were able to walk right up and ride all of the rides, many of them multiple times. The wait for Soaring was 180 minutes and my husband and son were on and off within 20 (the longest we had to wait). You also get special reserved seating for the parade, shows and fireworks. The characters paid extra special attention to my kids during the parade, which they loved. Jennifer was our guide and she was great! My kids loved her and so did we. Don't miss Tron or Pirates of Caribbean - they were amazing."
235,5.0,Apr 2019,"Falkirk, UK ",Another great Disney park! ,"We visited on a Tuesday in April 2019. We arrived fairly early, about 8:15ish and the queue for security was already huge. We also found (as British people) very odd that the queuing system is so mental however we discovered you just do as the Chinese do and move with them as they take each other over. The queue was about 20-25 minutes long and we had our bags and ourselves searched. Then comes the ticket area! If you have purchased online ahead of time you just go join the queue for people who have tickets. Ensure you take your passport as you will not be able to get the tickets otherwise. We showed the passports at the gate and received our tickets. Once we got through the gates we tried to join the WiFi to get fast passes however it didn’t work and we decided to just go join the queue for tron. We finally got the WiFi working and added our tickets to it only to discover 20 minutes after the park opened that they fast passes for  soaring over the horizon (by far the busiest ride in the park having a queueing time of over 2 hours for a good section of the day) had already gone. The park itself is very clean and very easy to navigate. The food we felt was a decent price compared to UK theme parks and we had a hot dog and various other snack items during the day. Try the caramel popcorn! It’s amazing! If you like Disneyland Paris then this will be a great addition to a Disney fans list and we found it to be superior to Paris for rides and experiences. Some of the Rides:Tron: very good ride, ended up going on it 5 times. After 6:30pm waiting time was reduced to 10 mins or less. Soaring over the horizon: fantastic ride, not sure it’s worth the 2 hour wait some people  waited though! Pirates of the Caribbean: best of the pirates’ ride and an amazing ride just in general. The animatronics were something else and the surprises you get along the way make it an awe inspiring experience. Challenge Trail at Camp Discovery: Great experience! So different from any other rides in Disney parks. We waited an hour two times to do the two routes available that day. If you only have 1 chance at doing it do the Hidden Falls Chamber (Trail 1 I think). It takes you round the mountain and under the waterfall! Overall a very good Disney park and i would love to go back one day! "
236,4.0,Apr 2019,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ",Relaxing and fun..,"We bought a 2 days admission ticket which was a wise thing to do as a family travelling with a 6 and 3 years old kids. It was a breezy day, and waiting lines were not as long as other disneylands that we went to. Probably it is due to the fact we went in on Monday and Tuesday (not a public holiday).  Knowing full well that China being a major producer of fireworks, the fireworks peesentation is rather disappointing. And be prepared to see thrash and litter everywhere after the firework presentation. Halal food is no where to be found but there is a good seafood and vegetarian (no pork served on premise) option at Tribal Table in Adventure Isle. There is also a Halal option outside of disneyland, in Disneytown at the food republic food court."

This park is very huge, you should put on your walking shoes if you want to experience the real deal. It's not a one day stop for sure. Lots and lots of fun for kids, shopping for all, great shows, many eating places to choose from, candies, sweets, desserts, just name it. It was a fantastic, funfilled, enjoyable day filled with lots of excitement. Tron was my favorite ride along with the Pirates of the Caribbean and Soaring over the Horizon. The Tron ride was a blast. TRON is totally different at night with the building lightened up! All 3 had 20-40 mins waits early in the morning and later in the evening (I was on a cloudy day).A pleasant and memorable visit, totally worth it!"

239,3.0,Mar 2019,"Lincoln, NE, ",Disappointing,"This park is fine but does not compare in any way to the Magic Kingdom in Orlando. It's cheaper to get in though, so that's a plus. The lines are long, so fast passes are necessary. There aren't as many characters or special things that make Disney magical. This park is clearly just about the rides, and there aren't that many of them. I will say that the Tron ride is fantastic and not to be missed. The Soaring Over the Horizon ride shows the same film as Soarin' in Orlando's Epcot, so if the line is too long and you've already seen it in the States, you aren't missing anything new. Disneyland has its own subway stop right outside the park, so it's convenient to get there from the city center."

241,4.0,Mar 2019,"Surrey, Canada ",READ THIS FOR TIPS,"Visited Shanghai Disneyland for one day with a group of people. Differences from US Disney parks:- Not as many rides and attractions- Characters not as visible- Snacks and food not same quality, more Asian options (I recommend the vegetable burger from Stargazer grill which comes with a drink and fries for 60 yuan and is very filling and good) - Staff not as friendly or welcoming (likely due to some cultural differences too) -long lineups Rides:Our favourite ride was TRON, make sure you ride it in the day and then at night when the lights are on.Pirates of the Carribean was awesome, more visual than the classic one but not as many drops in it.The adventure course was great too.TIPS:Go an hour early to que for the entrance. It gets very very busy!!Buy your ticket in advance and add it to the Shanghai Disney resort APP. Use the APP throughout the day to see queuing times, attraction times etc.You need WIFI or data to use the app. There is free park wifi but you need a SMS number to connect.If you can, try to go with NO BAGS. There a separate no bag lineup that you can go through. As soon as you’re in the park get your fast pass for soaring over the horizon, this ride was a minimum wait of 2 hours all day.Get fast passes every two hours on the APP, they run out fast though. You can purchase fast passes too but they are 80 yuan each. When you can use the single rider line. It’s substantially faster and we were able to ride together anyways.For the night fireworks go an hour to half hour early to get a good spot in front of the castle.Overall was a great day. You only need one day there in my opinion but we are not re there from open to close."

244,4.0,Mar 2019,"Singapore, Singapore ",Great fun!,"We had great fun in Shanghai Disneyland! Overall, it lived up to our expectation. The park is huge, clean, new, and well-managed. The only thing stopping me from giving a full 5 stars are the subpar quality of the overpriced food.My favourite ride is Tron Lightcycle Power Run and Pirates of the Caribbean. Pirates of the Caribbean ride in Shanghai Disneyland far surpasses the same ride in other Disney parks. It is even better than the most popular ride - Soaring Over The Horizon.Camp Discovery in Adventure Isle is another noteworthy attraction. Open for kids and adults, it offers rope courses on scenic trails.We tried 3 restaurants during our visit: Tangled Tree Tavern (Fantasyland), Stargazer Grill (Tomorrowland) and Pinocchio Village Kitchen (Fantasyland). Tangled Tree Tavern was quite ok, but food quality in Stargazer Grill and Pinnochio Village Kitchen were not up to standard. Price-wise, everything is overpriced, including the snacks. High food prices in theme park is sadly a norm, but for the quality, it was really terrible.The Enchanted Storybook Castle was amazing. It looks as magical as castles in other Disney parks but it's way, way bigger. It houses restaurant, boutique, shop, even a ride.During our visit, parade happens at noon. And since it was raining, the parade started late and replaced by much shorter version of what I suppose as more waterproof cars and characters. Tips:1. Go there in the middle of a work week. I believe Wednesday is the best day. Avoid school holiday, national holiday and all sorts of holidays. I went there for 2 days, Wednesday and Thursday, and it was less crowded on Wednesday. 2. Staying in Disney Hotel or Toy Story Hotel will allow you entrance from Disney Town, a full one hour before the main gate is opened for the rest of the guests. During that one hour, you can easily book your fast pass (you can only book once you enter the park), and ride 2-3 rides using the normal queue.3. Download the Shanghai Disney Resort app. On top of the map showing all rides/shows/restaurants/shops/facilities, there is also queue time estimation as well as fast pass reservation. Online fast pass reservation is really convenient.4. If you can afford the time, try to ride Tron Lightcycle Power Run twice, in the morning/afternoon and also in the evening when the motorcycles and ceilings are lit up. 5. Go for the fireworks show. The best viewing place would be at the front of the castle but everybody thinks so too, so to get a place you need to be there very early. Rather than jostling with the crowd, I opted for empty area at the side of the castle."
245,5.0,Oct 2018,"San Juan, Philippines ",Amazing! ,"We were afraid of initial newswe heard that the park is dirty. But now it is very clean and orderly unlike what we expected.We had a splendid time, waiting time was only 30-45 mins max. Some goes as low as 5 to 15 mins. It was a weekday so there were not much people I guess.Entrance to the park takes 1 hour due to super tight baggage check. Bringing in of food is NOT ALLOWED. Having an app and connecting it with your tickets allows you to get fast pass to rides. The app is very convenient to use. However, fast pass are NON TRANSFERABLE. I used some of our aunt's ticket to reserve rides, when it was our turn, we were not allowed to use them. We were just able to use 1 fast pass the whole time. Taking pictures with characters were very difficult as they only allow few people in. Say maybe only 10m-15 mins per session. We didn't have any character pictures because of that. Getting the klook picture pass didn't serve any purpose because there were no camera people in site. Because of this I should give Disney 2-3 star only. But counting my blessing, we still had lots of fun. "

Buffett breakfast is expensive and much less variety than Hong Kong Disney. Fast passes did not work and restricted to total of 5 adding into the app, confirmation failed, when inquiring with staff no one cared or made effort to help fix the issue, ultimately fast pass failed, it was only 1 so it was totally worthless in the end.  Shopping is fine as alway you can buy buy buy til you die!  No coffee in park that we could find, signage lacking for finding your way. Shuttle bus is best thing about the stay.  Room is good. I would save my money and go back to Hong Kong Disney next time, it is much better over all experience."
249,5.0,May 2018,N/A,Very fun day!,"We ended up going twice instead of just one time because we had an unexpected extra day. The park was so fun! Make sure you buy a Disneyland passport and get it stamped all over the park. We found some cool attractions we wouldn't have otherwise seen. And then once you get all of the pages of the passport stamped, you get a unique Disney pin. And a cool passport as a souvenir. The rides were all very fun. The food was a bit hit and miss sometimes. We had some chicken sandwiches that would have been ok but there was some Asian sauce on it that made them taste super weird. But other than that we enjoyed experimenting with pastries at the Ratatouille patisserie and eating churros and getting food at the Mulan Chinese restaurant. It was a very fun time. Oh, and the Pirates of Caribbean ride in incredible. And we went to the Pirates of the Caribbean show which was super fun. I could only understand maybe half of what was being said (my sister and her husband none) but the show was entertaining nonetheless."
250,5.0,Mar 2019,"Seattle, WA ",Family Visit to Shanghai Disneyland was amazing.  What a great adventure!,"We visited the second week of March 2019.  The park was not nearly as crowded as many of the reviews talked about.  Springbreak might be a great time to visit.  This was our first visit to Shanghai and to Shanghai Disney, but not to China.  We stayed at a fabulous boutique hotel which gave us some local pointers on how to get into and out of the park like we were a local.  It made it so much easier.  We downloaded the DiDi app and booked a car the night before.  Both mornings our ride was waiting for us.  The first day, we arrived 30 minutes before the park opened and discovered that was not early enough.  The lines were huge, and in China and frankly, it would be the same in the States, we had to fight to keep our spot in the line.  It was a bit chaotic with 1000's of our closest friends and exhausting.  It took about an hour to get through a security check after the gates opened.We had booked our tickets ahead of time (Trip Advisor works).  Just go straight to the line.  The second day we chose not to bring bags and went in the no bag line, arrived an hour early and we were in the park at about 10 minutes after the park opened.  Game changer.  Also, Saturday was not as busy as Friday.  A local friend fo ours with an annual passport said that Sundays is actually the slower day of the weekend.  For us, Friday was the busier day of the two.Once we got to the entrance, we used my US passport for all our entrance.  The tickets were printed right at the gate.  One HUGE benefit, download the Shanghai Disney app before getting to the park and once you have your tickets scan your group's paper tickets into the application.  Disney does have WIFI and it works great. You do need to have a working cell number to get a code to open the WIFI.  We had only one and two none working, but our daughters could put in my number and I would get a text and they could use that code.  Everyone had WIFI in the park. Put the paper tickets in a safe place.  You will need them for day 2 of admission--if you are going a second day.  Immediately, after scanning your ticket pick the fast past ride you want.  You can secure that on the phone app right away.  It is important to do this as the fast passes go quickly.  The first day we were only able to get one fast past for the Mine Train.  The second day, we got Tron for 10:05 a.m. and were able to book the Water Raft for around 2:30 p.m. which was perfect time (heat of the Spring Day).  There is an option to book single Fast Passes for rides at 80 yuan a piece or roughly $12.  For some that might be worth it.  I am not sure you need to buy any packages, at least not the days we were there.  We were able to get on every right we wanted to more than once and then some.  We rode Tron 3 times and Pirates 4 with no problem.  We did Soaring when we first got into the park the first day and waited about 30 minutes, I think the longest we waited for a ride was 60 minutes and I think we only did that one.  Our daughters are 12 and 14 and we loved the park, it is similar enough to feel Disney and its nostalgia, but unique enough to enjoy the fun.  The Castle is the largest of all the Disney parks and was simply fantastic inside and out.  If you love the Disney castle, this one is a must see.  WOW!  It is fantastic and what they do to it during the closing celebration is inspiring and pretty darn cool to watch.  The fireworks are great.  But not what some I know had hoped for in China, but they were still pretty cool.  Disney does everything pretty well.Our two favorite rides were Tron and Pirates for the Carribean.  Tron, I had not heard of it before going to the park, but wow.  It is a cousin to Space Mountain but built in 2016, so let's just say the technology blows it up.  You are sitting on a space bike (hunched over as if on a crock rocket), zooming in the dark in a roller coaster.  Yep...pretty intense.  We loved it.  We went right here on our second day and waited 10 minutes then had a fast pass for an hour later.  It was perfect.Pirates of the Caribean, if you are a Disney purist, this might not be for you.  However, I actually uttered the word ""WOW!"" during this ride.  Someone said to us, this ride is what California Disneyland would have done if the ride was built after the movie and not the movie after the ride.  Also, the technology of using IMAX in the ride...fantastic. We rode this ride 5 times and honestly could have gone on it 5 more.  It was a fan favorite in our family.  I don't want to spoil it, but we all loved it.  The singing and talking are all Chinese, but if you have been on this ride as many times as I have you can sing right along.  A couple of unique things as the park, there is an Adventure Park, basically a ropes course that goes around a waterfall.  The course has three levels.  I have done enough courses at this point that even the advanced level was pretty basic to me, but it was entertaining to watch how many people were terrified or got stuck on different sections.  But certainly worth taking the time to do this one.  It was a long wait because of all the safety precautions and gear...but glad we did it.The parade, the shows, and the characters are all there.  It is Disney with a Chinese flare.  I could honestly go on for a long time about the two days we spent at the park. As we ended the day, our host at the boutique hotel recommended we take the resort bus 2 to the Shendi North stop and catch a DiDi from there.  Let's just say, it saved us about 60 to 90  minutes after a long day--the taxi line was HUGE.  The bus cost 1 yuan per person.  It was so simple and got us out of the chaos of the park.  The subway was not an option for us. It was such a relaxing way to exit all the chaos."
251,4.0,Mar 2019,"Greater Sydney, Australia ",Well???,"We visited Shanghai in August 2017 and did not visit Shanghai Disney because all the reviews mentioned the extremely large crowds and the extra long queues at every ride. So today I was determined to visit, although reluctantly, and my expectations were quite low. I was expecting a huge hour long wait at the ticket office and long lines at rides. We arrived at about 10am and walked straight to the ticket office window - no waiting at all. We entered the park and waited from 5 to 25 minutes for most rides - not bad at all. We did not wait anytime at all at ""Buzz Lightyear Planet Rescue"" -  walked straight on. Had 3 rides trying to score over 700,000 targets. Don't miss the photo of you in action firing your light-sabre gun as you exit the ride. In Fantasyland I could not believe the size of the castle and that you could venture inside. ""Pirates of the Caribbean Battle for the Sunken Treasure"" was amazing - very creative. There is also a photo of your ride as you exit - you can take your own photo of the picture on the screen. ""Tyron Light Cycle Power Run"" was the best. There are many different rides and I found the park much, much bigger than Hong Kong Disney and more spectacular than Anaheim Disney.It was 399CYN ($88AUD) entry fee.Don't buy an ice cream - 40CYN ($9AUD) is a BIT rich!!The Metro station is close by, a 5CYN ($1AUD) fare from Nanjing Road and only took 40 minutes.If you download the app you can access 2 complimentary Fass Passes, I believe.All in all a very enjoyable day - far, far better than expected."
252,5.0,Mar 2019,"England, UK ",Some of the best attractions in the world!,"We visited for two days on a Thursday 28th February and Friday 1st March.  The park didn't feel overly busy, but was a bit busier on the Friday.The park itself is huge so be prepared to walk a lot.  The cast members we encountered were very friendly with varying levels of English, but we didn't have any problems.There weren't any disappointing attractions, but some really stand out particularly Pirates, Buzz and Tron.  The parade was good too.  The shows were well done, but no English although you can work out what is going on.We didn't experience any problems with anti-social behaviour that others have mentioned although that may have been because it was relatively quiet.  Soarin ran out of Fastpasses first, followed by Seven Dwarfs Mine Train.  Most of the day waits were between 5 and 20 minutes, only those two attractions went above that some time.We stayed a the Toy Story Hotel so had early entry which was great.  We got to do so much in that hour, we didn't see anyone else in some parts of the park, it is really worth staying onsite for that alone."
253,5.0,Jul 2018,N/A,The Fantastic Disneyland,"Last Summer vacation, I arrived in Shanghai at night with my mother. The next morning, We went to Disneyland. I thought I had a good time!There are a lot of entertainments. In the morning, we played some entertainments, such as rowing a boat, going fishing. My favourite entertainment was wild water-Which was very exciting in the water like roller coaster. It’s very fantastic. The wild water is definitely a must when visiting Disneyland.For lunch, You can had some snacks. There are many different Rinds of it. But personally I would say don’t buy an ice-cream, It’s very expensive. You should spend 40 Yuan and only can get one! And the ice-cream is very easy to melt. It’s not worth wasting so much money. At last, It’s highly recommended that you should look at the cartoon character’s Parade. It’s very interesting. You can took a lot of photos with snow queen, Long hair princess and others. It won’t disappoint you!"
254,4.0,Feb 2019,"Mexico City, Mexico ",Amazing! ,"Probably the best Disney park in the world, I’ve been to Disneyland in Anaheim, to Walt Disney World in Orlando and to Tokyo Disney Resort and this park was the most amazing Disneyland park I have ever been to! We went on a crowded day (February 4th) but we were still able to enjoy the park. I highly recommend to book your fast pass as soon as you get your tickets activated because they run out pretty fast. I suggest you to ride first Pirates of the Caribbean (breathtaking), Tron Power Run (my personal favorite), Rex’s Racer, Soaring, and of course, visit the Marvel Universe, Alice in Wonderland Mace; and as many rides as you can count! Not all staff speaks english, but you can always help yourself with the Shanghai Disneyland App, also, there’s free wifi in the park and you can search everything you need in the app. I advice to wear comfy sneakers (there’s a lot of walking involved) and clothes adapted to the season you’re going (I went on winter and I wore a lot of sweaters but in summer is too hot in Shanghai); also, you can bring food from outside and don’t forget to take a lot of pictures inside and outside the park! There’s a lot of places where you can snap a nice photography there! The park is located in Pudong area, in car is 40 minutes away from downtown or you can arrive in metro, it takes about one hour and a half, it’s pretty convenient and not expensive. I don’t give the five points because food wasn’t as good as we thought it would be, we ate at the restaurant next to the Pirates of the Caribbean ride and it was good but not too tasty as other food we have eaten in other Disneyland parks, though was not too pricey as other parks. Also we tried some snacks and they were ok. "

I would say that this suits everyone, kids, teenagers, friends, couples, yes everyone. There is something for everyone, we got adventure isle for those who wants to explore and walk up a waterfall, treasure cove for those who like pirates, toy story world for the youngest visitors, Tomorrowland for people that like the futuristic (and also a TRON rise and you actually go on the motorbike and yes that was AMAZING). Restaurants and cafes with different themes. At 8 PM starts the light show, maybe a little late for the youngest but really cool to see, it goes on for 20 minutes."

259,5.0,Sep 2018,"Port of Spain, Trinidad ",A funfilled evening,"This park is very huge, you must put on your walking shoes if you want to experience the real deal. It's not a one day stop for sure.  There are go carts which carry you from point A to B if you so wish.  Lots and lots of fun for the kids, shopping for all, great shows, many eating places to choose from, the candies, sweets, desserts, fast food, just name it.  It was a fantastic, funfilled, enjoyable, evening filled with lots of excitement."
260,4.0,Jul 2018,"Melbourne, Australia ",Fantastic but wouldn't go without fastpass,"This is my third Disneyland and loved it. (Anaheim and Hong kong) Shanghai Disneyland is worth the trek. We hired a taxi from centre of Shanghai and wasn't too expensive. Can catch train but takes longer. Make sure you arrive 1-2 hrs before opening  and allow 1.5 hrs queing time even then. I had downloaded the app and switched my internet on once in the que (Wi-Fi useless) purchase tickets days ahead and then hope you get inside with enough time to buy the fastpass(can only purchase fastpass once your inside,  limited available ) this pass was worth every penny. Considering we were one of the first people in the door que for rides exceeded 1.5 hours. With fastpass you choose which ride and simple walk right in. Longest time we que was 15mins!Beautiful gardens. Fun rides. Hard to find a place to sit in all restaurants. Not alot of snack options except ice creams. Prepare to sit on the ground or stand and no chairs or benches. Western toilet options and I found it was the few places in China that i didn't have to que for them if I didn't want to use local squat toilets.Not many western food items but your in China so to be expected. Not allowed to bring food in but we managed to bring in some fruit and water."
261,3.0,Feb 2019,"Suzhou, China ",Nice castle but that is it.,"The whole experience was weird. Some attractions that we stopped in the middle, everything stopped with the rain, missing the disney signature of main street and not enough attractions and queue way too long.. like from 1 to 3 hours. Otherwise for a park it is not bad but when going to Disney you expect to be perfect!"
262,5.0,Feb 2019,"Suzhou, China ",Wonderful experience,"This park is much bigger than I expects, easily as good as Florida and much better than Hong Kong. I went for 2 days (Wed and Thur) over Chinese New Year. We stayed on property so we’re allowed in 30 minutes early and had 4 fast passes per day. It was very busy but honestly we did everything in one day. The second day we were able to go slow and enjoy the surroundings. Fast passes really help, but they go fast so get on it as soon as you enter the park. I recommend using it for Soarin and Rapids. The other rides you will get on with a 30 minute wait at the right times. Tron was my favourite ride along with Pirates of the Caribbean. Both had 20-40 min waits early in the morning and later in the evening. The park is beautiful, well laid out with lots of staff. It is expensive to eat in and buy merchandise, but all Disney parks are. There are so many things to do. In 2 days I rode Tron and Pirates 4 times, Soarin and Rapids 2 times and everything else at least once. The shows are good, but all in English. Tarzan is a circque style show, pirates is a fun stunt show. The parade which ran at noon and 15.00 was great, lots of people watching, but easy to find a good spot. The light up and firework show began at 20.30. People started waiting 2 hours early to get a good view which is crazy. I arrived 20 mins before and although I was a little far back, I still had a good view, the castle is huge!Finally there are lots of characters around, in particular the Disney characters (Micky, Donald, Goofy, Etc) hang around the park entrance and had a 20 minute wait to see. They also have some zootopia and jungle book characters by Soarin. Marvel had a couple of meet and greets with a longer wait. Star Wars is situated behind Tron and is hard to see, so when we went it was empty and had no waits to meet characters. We met the princesses in the castle, this can get busy, but we began waiting during lunch when no characters were out, so the line was short. It took us 30 minutes. "
263,4.0,Apr 2018,"Mumbai, India ",Huge and crowded,"Missed a star as it is too big to finish in a day and very crowded... well it's the newest addition and so crowd would be there... but being huge all areas are scattered unlike Hong Kong where space constraint is there... it's little far from main Shanghai city centre... well vegetarian food is also a problem here but they don't allow outside food here... it was tough to convince them as communicating in English was also tough... but they allowed in the end to carry our own food... we were able to complete the balance rides which were new here and we did HK Disneyland a week back... otherwise Shanghai Disneyland takes 2 full days... major attraction is TRON, soaring over the horizon and others... would strictly suggest to follow app a few days before and study to complete all rides in 1 day... check park timings and be first to reach.. being huge it really controls people in a good way during exits and entry... fire cracker show in the end and also Disney parade were good attractions..

266,4.0,Feb 2019,Hertfordshire ,Mixed Bag But Still Enjoyable,"Having been to all the Disney parks bar Paris, I was really excited to experience the newest Disney park!The positives would have to be the spaciousness and the whimsical attention to detail. Walking between rides you very rarely felt jostled by the crowd.I also felt there was a lot of effort to have some English on signs and restaurant menus which was really nice. I think all the cast members I met had at least a few words which I really appreciated. I would say Pirates of the Caribbean is incredible and has really raised the bar on the rides for all the parks. I did really enjoy Soaring as well (although the standby queue hit 120 min 1 minute after official park opening) and loved the little travel posters for the destinations too.There are some areas where it was a bit disappointing. I really missed Main Street Disney and how it really sets up the entrance, Mickey Avenue is just too short! The cast members on average aren't as smiley and ""Disney"" as in other parks- there were some exceptions but in general. I also didn't feel crowd control for rides was as good- there were a few occasions where everyone was bunched up and pushing which wasn't great Personally, I think it is a nice park and although small does have some lovely rides however at this stage I would rate Hong Kong/Tokyo/LA and Florida over it. That said, if you are in Shanghai I would definitely check it out!"
267,5.0,Feb 2019,N/A,Biggest Disney castle there is.,"This was a very interesting experience.  The grounds are much larger and more spread out than Disneyland in California.  Purchasing a ticket is a little different online.  You buy the ticket, and then there's also the option to buy a Concierge ticket at various levels. Concierge tickets DO NOT include admission, and are a bit expensive, but they act as fast pass tickets for any time at various rides, and seemed to be worth it to me."
268,5.0,Oct 2018,"Brisbane, Australia ",Enjoyable park worth visiting ,Tron and Pirates of the Caribbean are the must do attractions in this park.Avoid arriving too early as the queues can be massive outside. After 11am the queues seem to diminish dramatically. You cannot pay for your entrance fee in cash.Food inside the park was enjoyable and reasonably priced.
269,2.0,Feb 2019,Hemel Hempstead UK ,Not the disney magic,"Unfortuantley we visited during chinese new year so the four adult rides of tron, soaring, pirates and the gold train all had queues of over an hour and half. The pirates of the carribean was a much improved version of the orlando and california versions. The tron ride is not in usa yet and was very good. No haunted house or space mountain or river cruise.  The entry to the park is a real  pain as they need to see your passports etc etc.  Entry to orlando takes 5mins., it took us over 45 mins. The checking was pathetic. The metro gets you striaght to the park but unless you have a spare day in shanghai i would not bother with the park.  Way too much hasstle. Why have they built a toy story land so inferior to the orlando toy story is way beyond logic. The toy story land in orlando us brilliant in shanghai it is simply just awfull."

272,3.0,Apr 2018,"Christchurch, New Zealand ",Still a long way to go before it can claim to be the happiest place on Earth,"I took a group of high school students here as part of their China tour, and the kids were somewhat disappointed.  Most of them spent like three to four hours in the queue for a 10 minutes ride.  On average, each kid did two rides throughout the day (we were there before they opened the gate and left around 5.30pm).  They need to have better crowd control (just like most of the tourist attractions in China do).  A lot of the attractions in the theme park are live performances, which are catering for pre-teen kids, most of my students found the performances silly and awkward.  The thrill rides are not ""thrill"" enough except the Tron one.  The beautiful castle turned out to be a waste of space as the whole castle is for the ""princess experience"" for the young girls to dress up, and you have to make an appointment beforehand.  Among all the Disneylands I've been to (California, Tokyo and Paris), the Shanghai one is like ""boh"" - it's not bad, but not great either, definitely not the happiest place on Earth yet."
273,5.0,Dec 2018,"Rowley Regis, UK ",December is a Great Time to Visit,"Probably the newest of all the Disney theme parks, with it only opening in 2015, but nonetheless, has a reputation of being very popular at certain times of the year.  Fortunately, we chose to visit during mid-December when schools are yet to break up, and given the colder temperatures and mid-week days, it was never going to be that busy.Laid out in a similar format as many of the Disneyland theme parks throughout the world, this one is no different and had all the trademarks of the global brand.  Obviously there was a Chinese theme to parts of the park, but Disney has left it as close as possible to tradition, and all of the familiar attractions and amenities were there.English was spoken throughout the park and signs and announcements were in both English and Chinese.  The park relies quite a lot on their mobile App., for pre-booking, fast passes, also proving up to the minute details on queue times at the attractions, however, to be able to use the App., we needed to register. At the time of writing, to complete registration, the App sends a confirmation message to your mobile phone, however, the App does not recognise many telephone numbers outside of Europe and the USA, and unfortunately our mobiles are registered in the UAE, a number that could not be accepted.  We were fortunate that as we were staying at one of the Disneyland hotels, one of the hotel employees had a spare account and allowed us to use their account, enabling us to take full advantage of the park.We spent best part of two days inside the theme park, and did most of the stuff that we wanted to, with a further half day at the Downtown area of shops and restaurants just outside the main gate.  This we felt did justice to the theme park, and one day may well not be enough.Having now visited all the Disneyland/Disney World parks around the world with the exception of California, this one in Shanghai ranks highly and is well worth the visit.  Go out of season and during school term time if you can, the queues for the rides are non-existent, with the maximum time we spent waiting in line was twenty minutes, but most of the time being less than five."
274,5.0,Jan 2019,"Brisbane, Australia ",Awesomely surprised,"On our last day in Shanghai, we decided to venture out to Disneyland.  I recommend anyone intending on visiting Shanghai Disney who is travelling from outside of China to download the Shanghai Disneyland App prior to arriving in the country.  As google is not permitted, if you require google play to download apps, you will not be able to once in China.  The problem with this is that the easiest way to purchase tickets and fast passes is through the app.  In saying that, the hotel were able to assist me in purchasing tickets, including fast passes, it just took a bit longer than if I had the app available.  Disneyland was awesome.  The Tron ride was really cool.  We didn't have to line up more than 20 minutes for any of the rides but I can see on busy days that Fast Passes are well worth the money.  We have now been to all of the disney parks except for Euro disney and this one surprisingly turned out to be one of our favourites."
275,5.0,Dec 2018,"Eugene, OR, ",Great Time in December,"This completed my adults son's goal of going to every Disneyland in the world, LA, Florida, Paris, Hong Kong and Shanghai. I mention December because I can not imagine how hot and uncomfortable this park would be in the summer. This is a very big park three or four times the size of LA Disneyland. There are no more rides and exhibits they are just bigger and more spread out. The park has few trees as it is relatively new. It is very clean and well laid out but long walks everywhere. The are many stories, I believe to be true, that in the summer you may only ride four or five rides in a day. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride is fantastic on the better indoor rides we have ever experienced. But the star to the show is the Tron ride. Which is basically riding on a dragster motorcycle. Fun, Fun, Fun and a perfect way to end our trip to China.Instead of a haunted mansion they have a Mystic Mansion that is a very good ride. The castle here is huge."

Could ride Tron (excellent) more than once per day and spend lots of time in the Tron Experience."

278,5.0,Dec 2018,"Brighton, UK ",Super quiet park and great rides!,"We visited on a grey Thursday in December just before Christmas and had a brilliant day! We were just here on a 2 day stopover between New Zealand and England and it was a great side trip! I assume due to the weather the park was practically empty. We had read up on how you should arrive an hour before opening to get through the queues and bag searches etc and to get the fast pass for tron and soaring but we arrived just as it opened to no queue! We walked through security (note you can't take any food or drink with you, even mints!), collected our tickets and then went to see about fast passes on the app and found the longest queue time was 10 minutes! We went on Tron 4 times, the snow white mine cart ride a few times, soaring where we just walked through and were on the ride in 5 minutes and loads of other rides! The fast pass app was super easy to use although we never really needed it.Our favourite area was Tomorrowland whcih looked amazing at night with the Tron bikes whizzing around! The only thing that was a shame was as it wasn't that busy not many of the food stands were open but we went out to the Cheesecake Factory in Disney Town just outside the park (there is an entrance and re-entry gate just next to Tomorrowland so no need to queue at the main entrance if you leave and return). The light/fireworks display was great and worth waiting for even in the cold! We were also warned to get our return train ticket when we arrived at the station and we had but the train was really quiet so there was no worry about queues to get the subway back.The park was super clean and tidy and the staff were all really friendly. We really liked the Pirates of the Caribbean show and high ropes course in the Adventure area too so don't miss those! We also bought our tickets through Klook which saved us some money and we just had to show our passport at the ticket gate to collect the tickets so very easy!"
279,5.0,Nov 2018,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, ",Strategies to best enjoy Shanghai Disneyland,"Yes, you need strategies to enjoy Shanghai Disneyland. Why? Because it's gigantic, it's expensive, they've timings for everything, so you if you want to make the best of your trip, you gotta plan.Overview:Shanghai Disneyland is the newest Disneyland open in 2016. If you've been to Hong Kong Disneyland, this one is three times the size of that. They've different zones and worlds, you most likely WILL NOT cover everything in one day... so choose ahead what you like most and head beeline for those.What you have to do:1. DISNEY APPDownload the Disney app way in advance. You can observe the waiting times for everything months in advance. Which was what we did.2. DON'T BRINGDon't get over-emotional when they confiscate your selfie sticks, food and drinks, because they already explicitly stated in their rules that visitors are not allowed to bring them. Except, if you've young kids.3. FREE DISNEYLAND VILLAGE It's right outside the amusement park, it's free and open to public. Playground, restaurants, cafes, Disney theatre, etc. We thoroughly explored and enjoyed that on the evening we arrived, and even caught (a much better view) of the legendary Disney fireworks from OUTSIDE the amusement park. A lot more food options here than inside the park. Great to check out the memorabilia too that are only available here (e.g. Disneyland Shanghai Starbucks mugs...!). Legoland's flagship two story store is here too.  4. STAY OVERNIGHT AT DISNEYLANDHighly recommended to stay at either hotel (Toy Story Hotel for the lower end; Disneyland Hotel for the higher end). Only hotel stayers get the privilege of entering the amusement park 30 minutes before public. We completed numerous simple rides without any queues during that golden 30 minutes. After which, average queuing time is 30 minutes even for a one-minute ride! Also worth noting - if you've young kids, you don't really want to brave the crowds for taxi/metro after your 9pm fireworks show, do you?5. SHOW TIMINGSYou MUST take note of the timing of THREE shows - the morning palace show, the late afternoon parade and the evening fireworks show. If you're not a Chinese-speaker, the morning show is the ONLY  SHOW that's in English. If you missed that, you'll have to make do with humming along to the Disney tunes, but in Mandarin, for all other shows in the park. The timing of the show changes every few days. Crazy ain't it? That's why the downloading the app is so important! That's where they do live updates of show timings.6. FAST PASSESThey're free, but you can only hold on to one at any one time. The smartest usage of a fast pass we realized --- book the Winnie Pooh ride at 9am (when the park opens and queue starts getting long almost immediately). After utilizing that fast pass, you're now free to grab the next fast pass. FYI - the Chevrolet TRON ride is pretty hot too. 7. SINGLE RIDERSMost Asians don't like to ride alone, without their friends/family members. Single riders are obviously, for those who don't mind riding alone. You'll be taking those odd empty seat on each ride. The queue for this is extremely quick, usually only 10 minutes compared to the normal line of 100 minutes. 8. FOOD OPTIONSDisneyland is not well known for its food, nor its prices. If you've been following the above strategies, you may as well note: Breakfast should be purchased the night before at the cafes at Disneyland 'village', especially if you intend to take the 7.30am shuttle bus to the amusement park. Either that, or you can buy breakfast from those Disneyland vendors who are walking around selling sandwiches to those in the loooong shuttle bus queue. Lunch is pretty decent at Barbossa's Bounty. It opens at 11am. Dinner options at ToyStory outdoor booths are highly overpriced. You may want to try the indoor food court at TRON modern zone. If you want the luxurious fine dining at their one and only restaurant in the palace, you HAVE to make a reservation the day before to avoid disappointment, because slots run out fast for both lunches and dinners. Plus, they've meet and greets of ONE mysterious princess before your meal, and Mickey/Minnie/Donald/Daisy throughout your meal."
280,3.0,Dec 2018,"Beijing, China ","Fun, but could be more convenient!","As others have commented, GET THE FAST PASSES or go for the concierge pass before you get there. If you don't it is hard to do whle inside and there is a lot of waiting. Also, the walk from the drop off to the park is super long (who's brainy idea was that?) and yes, no shuttles! So be prepared to walk for a good 1.5-2km just to get inside the park!But on the whole, a large park, lots of Disney googas that was very fun for our 3yo daughter. The Star Wars portion was closed so Boo! But she got to see all her other favorite characters so Princess Leia will have to wait for our next Disney adventure sometime."

We tried with the complimentary WiFi, but it didn't work.Once inside start with the rides you think you like the best, you probably won't have time for all of them. We had to wait between 10 and 70 minutes. We liked TRON the best (fastest ride at any Disney park) and rode it 3 times, Pirates of the Caribbean, Roaring Rapids and the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train in this order.We also liked the possibility to walk into the castle.Food is less expensive than Disney World Florida. We also found an ATM that worked fine with our VISA card."

283,5.0,Dec 2018,"Saint Paul, MN, ",Goal achieved!  We have been to all six Disney parks!,"We stayed at the Fairmont Peace Hotel near the Bund and debated how to travel to Disneyland.  The simpler and quicker option was going by cab which took us a short hour.  We were relieved to see a cab stand for the return trip to our hotel.  I think the one way fare was around $25.Our tickets were bought online and we brought out confirmation letter plus our passports to the theater located at Downtown Disney to get our tickets.  We also purchased fast pass premium tickets since we were not sure how crowded the park would be since we were there on December 23.  These fast pass tickets were bought online but could only purchase one week in advance.Because of the fast pass tickets, we entered a special entrance to the park.  There were very few people at this entrance but then again it was around 9 a.m.  Overall, the park was not crowded in the morning but by afternoon, the park crowd really swelled.Our fast pass premium tickets provided us with access to the following:  Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Peter Pan's Flight, Winnie the Pooh, Pirates of the Caribbean, Soarin, Roaring Rapids, Tron, and Buzz Lightyear.  We didn't attend the parade, but there was a reserved area for fast pass holders.We first headed to the rides that were not part of the fast pass such as Dumbo and Pixar Toy Storyland.  We were able to quickly go on the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Peter Pan, Winnie the Pooh and the Hunny Pot spin.The cold weather prohibited us from going on the Roaring Rapids.  Soarin was mostly the same scenes but still one of my favorite rides.  The intro was rather unique.The absolute best ride in all the six parks was Shanghai's version of Pirates of the Caribbean!  We had to go on it twice.  We loved the easier to use controls on Buzz Lightyear.  Tron Lightcycle is not for the faint of heart and only our 28 year old daughter was brave enough to go.  No thanks!We tried the cherry flavored popcorn and liked it. Our lunch was at Barbossa's Bounty in Treasure Cove.  We ordered the ribs (which came with plastic gloves to wear, not a bad idea!) and the fish which was quite delicious as well.The Alice in Wonderland Maze was a great place for photo ops.We noticed that of all the Disney parks in the world, the people really dressed up the most here.  Some men wore suits and quite a few of the 20 something females wore dresses or very stylish outfits.Of all the six parks I would rank them:  DisneyWorld, Disneyland, Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Paris."

At first i thought Shanghai Disneyland is very big but is not too big for me. So far all the rides is more suitable for kids and those merchandise design is not nice for me. But still buying something because i'm Mickey fans. Love the mickey popcorn bucket so much. Due to i visit during Dec, weather is good. I am lucky because the day i visit is not crowded.1 things that i quite disappointed is no much fireworks, maybe due to China banned for fireworks, overall is still not bad."
285,4.0,Jan 2019,Los Angeles ,Small but fun,"My best friend and I insisted Shanghai Disney during a 12 hour layover in Shanghai (we left the airport with a 24 hour visa, issued on site at the airport). It was January 4, 2019, and the weather was rainy all day, which may have been the reason for the extremely low crowd level (at least it seemed low to us, who are are used to the crowds at Disneyland in California and Disney World in Florida). We walked onto every ride within 10 minutes. We were able to ride Pirates of the Caribbean, Seven Dwarves Mine Train, the RC car ride in Toy Story Land, Peter Pan and the Journey to the Crystal Grotto all within 2 hours. Pirates of the Caribbean was AMAZING, the special effects are so much more advanced than anything we have seen in the American parks. The other rides were basically the same as the American versions, which was just fine. There were not that many snak options, we really only saw popcorn stands. We had lunch at the Pinocchio themed restaurant, the food offered was mostly seafood and noodles, with a couple of pizza options. I tried the pizza, it was awful (compared to American pizzas - maybe it was a delicious version of Chinese pizza that I am just not used to?) and my friend had seafood noodles and she liked them a lot. I also had a tiramisu dessert, which was pretty good. The castle and all the buildings were really well done, but it seemed like the park could have used a good coat of paint. Shopping was disappointing and pretty limited, compared to the options in American parks. All the same products we could find at home. We arrived at 8am and we were finished with everything by noon. It was easy to find a cab back to the airport as well. We had a good time and I am glad we crossed this off the bucket list, but I wouldn’t plan a trip around this destination. Also, they had both Eastern and western toilets."

287,5.0,Dec 2018,"Singapore, Singapore ",Fantastic Disney Magic! ,"I have visited almost all the disney parks around the world and Shanghai did not disappoint! The park is HUGE! Prepare to walk as the vast expanse of the many amazing worlds will just take your breath away. The castle is also the biggest of all the disney parks and is so impressive.We went in December and was worried it would be too cold...it was cold...but did not spoil our time at all! Infact, i think the cold kept people away and as a result we never queued more than 10minutes for a ride the whole two days we were in the park! Do not miss out on the amazing stage shows, especially in-front of the castle and the Tarzan and Pirates shows! Staff all spoke much better english than i was expecting.If you are a fan of character meet and greets the photo pass is worth buying for sure! Overall, a truly magical place and they are definitely going to expand in the coming years with so much land around the park. "
288,5.0,Jun 2018,"Concord, Australia ",Amazing experience,"100% recommend purchasing a fast pass as soon as you get into the park. Its a necessity to avoid 200 minute waiting times. With the purchased fast pass, we never waited more than 15 minutes for a ride. Amazing experience as our first Disneyland with modern and immersive rides and a grand castle. Summer parade was great and very camp. We later went to Hong Kong Disneyland and did not find it nearly as great as Shanghai."
289,4.0,Jan 2019,"Melbourne, Australia ","Worth a visit, but not as Magical as Los Angeles","So to answer the question if Disney Shanghai is worth it - I just went on the 2nd of Jan. It was cold (not freezing) but windy enough to be fully kitted up. I think due to off-peak times, the longest wait was only 50-60 mins on a few rides like Tron and 7 dwarves rides.In terms of how this compares - I would say until I saw the Parade, it didn't really feel Disney. Yes there was Disney all around, and everyone was wearing Mickey ear bands, but I didn't see any Disney consume characters anywhere - the rides felt shorter than in the US, and I didn't see enough Disney pride. The Parade helped pick up the Disney mood, but it was a little less magical than expected.The good news is that most staff members had basic English at least so you got by when needed, and the food wasn't as expensive as everyone made it out to be (The Mickey Pizza's tasted decent, but the Turkey legs were great). I would HIGHLY HIGHLY suggest purchasing the additional Premier Access pass which gives you instant access to 6 or 7 rides in the fast pass lane (rather than waiting, you can enter anytime). I managed to cover every single ride that I wanted in 1 day with this, and the max I was waiting for any ride was 15 mins (if the normal line was 50-60, then this was worth it).It it still worth doing? Yes - highlights being Tron and Pirates of the Caribbean ride (Tron being the coolest ride, and Pirates being the only ride I've ever taken twice in a row). It's an updated Disney LA basically, with less Disney charm - but I still enjoyed it with my older family (youngest was 27)."
290,5.0,Dec 2018,"Singapore, Singapore ",My favourite Disneyland!,"Shanghai was the last stop in our family's Disneyland adventure that began with a visit to the Paris edition, and has since taken us to Hong Kong, Tokyo, Orlando, and Anaheim.Of all the parks, this new version comes out tops for me  in terms of crowd (we went on a wintry Friday), food (I love Chinese food) and rides (not that the others don't have them but we got to do more because of the shorter queues)."
291,4.0,Dec 2018,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ",Good family fun,My second trip to a Disneyland (been to Tokyo years ago) and this park seemed pretty nice. It was the Saturday before New Year so it was packed and cold but we still managed to have fun. Highlights were the shows and parades (11:15am) as some of the queues for the major rides were too long for our liking. We bought our tickets online and apparently we could have downloaded some fast passes on an app but we didn't know how to do that. We still managed to get on some good rides though and in the final analysis my 5 year old loved it. Am sure I will be dragged there again in the not too distant future.
292,3.0,Dec 2018,N/A,Magical yet Underwhelming,"First off, had to take any comparisons to Disney World off the table. After that, while the park was fun and the castle was beautiful, the staff was disappointing. Part of the Disney magic comes from interacting with the cast. The only people who actually looked like they were happy were the princesses- everyone else was rather grim faced. The worst thing (personal of course) was that on two separate visits (October and December), the Dole Whip place was closed both days over the span of 5-6 hours each. We kept being told the people were on break which we initially understood but after 3 hours just found slightly ridiculous.Side note: don’t go on your birthday and expect anything special- when the cast is gloomy and glum but you were expecting happy (re: it is DISNEY), it puts a damper on things.Rating out of 5 Stars:Human interactions: 1 StarPrincess interactions: 5 StarFood: 2 Star (a lot of places were closed or out of specialty items early in the day for the entire day)Rides: 5 Star"
293,5.0,Nov 2018,N/A,Ride TRON at night!,"A pleasant and memorable visit.TRON is totally different experience at night with the building lightened up! Shorter queue in the night also.The crystal grotto also, it's meh in the day but magical at night.People with kid(s) under 10 should definitely take a stroller. The park is huge and your kid will wear out quickly if walking by him/herself. You can rent stroller at the entrance, but that would likely cost you 15 minutes and miss some early attractions. Better take your own stroller to save time (I rented one from the hotel I stayed in)."

In order to avoid the long queue, purchase of premium passes for the several top attractions was a good decision for me, I covered 8 of them by 3pm at a leisurely pace.To my delight, I did not encounter any inconsiderate people jumping queue and the workers of the theme park were generally polite and cheerful.A good place to go when in Shanghai!"

The castle is definitely the most beautiful and elaborate off them all. The shows on the stage of the castle are amazing. See them all if you can. We especially enjoyed the show with the Chinese dancers because of its uniqueness. Even if you are afraid of roller coasters, you must ride TRON, since it is the only one in the world. The parades are really cute. I would recommend eating in DisneyTown instead of in the park, as the food is better outside."
298,5.0,Dec 2018,Singapore ,Newest and Best Disneyland in Asia,"Newest and best Disneyland in Asia. Much bigger than Hong Kong Disneyland. Spacious layout with many new rides. In typical China fashion, technology is incorporated in all aspects: from the entry tickets with your photo, booking of Fastpass, entry at rides via Fastpass, photopass, meal vouchers, rides, etc. The activities in the park are closely integrated with the Shanghai Disneyland app. Set up the account before entering the park. After that link your tickets to the app and you are good to go. Each account can only link up to 5 tickets.Guests staying at the 2 hotels in the Shanghai Disneyland resort get to enter the park via a side entrance at Disneytown. This entrance opens 30 minutes before the main entrance opens. And the queue here is much shorter. Need to present both your room card and park tickets to gain entry. The early entry allows you to ride the popular rides before the main crowd enters.Fastpass for the rides can only be obtained after you entered the park. Get the Fastpass via the app on your phone. Fastpass for popular rides will run out before noon. Standby queue for these popular rides are at least an hour. So do your research and plan your trip wisely. Check the app for the waiting time of the various rides and showtimes.Multiple eating places scattered all around the park: from snack kiosks to food courts to restaurants. Food quality is average and a little on the high side. If you have time, can exit to Disneytown beside the park where there are multiple restaurants. You can re-enter the park via this side entrance before 8pm to watch the fireworks.Avoid weekends and China national holidays as the park can be quite crowded."
299,4.0,Dec 2018,"Pristina, Kosovo ","Great Family Fun, not quite Disney quality food","We really enjoyed our trip to Shanghai Disneyland. Everything we read about the advantages of coming during the week on a non-Chinese holiday proved to be true. The ticket places are in three tiers, with non-holiday weekdays being the lowest priced days. We were there December 26 and 27. The longest we waited for any ride/experience was 45 minutes for the adventure ropes course. We stayed at the Toy Story Hotel to take advantage of the free shuttle, extra Fast Pass reservation, and early entry to the park. The early access ended up being 7:45 AM with the park opening at 8:00 AM to the rest of the ticket holders. It gave us enough time to take a couple pictures and get to our first ride before the rest of the people entered the park. The free shuttle was a great perk. The fast pass reservations were nice as well. Though the list was a bit limited, we were able to reserve spots on Tron for one day and on The Seven Dwarves Mine Ride for the second day. We were also able to take advantage of the free fast passes that came through linking our park tickets with the park smartphone app. While we had a great time and rode most of the rides, there were a couple let downs. The food quality did not seem up to the Disney standard from other parks we have visited. There was one meal, the steak dinner, at Mickey and Pals Market Cafe that seemed worth the 100+ RMB that we paid for it, but other than that and the chocolate chip cookie from Remy’s Patisserie, the food left us wanting more in terms of either quality or quantity for the price we were paying. I made the mistake of purchasing bentos from Merlin’s Magic Recipe for about 80. RMB a tray, which turned out to be microwaved TV dinners reminiscent of the 80’s that had the taste of low quality economy class airplane food (which I have had plenty of in my travels). If you have the time to spare, I would recommend heading out to Disneytown for meals. You can re-enter the park through a gate that is right near a handful of Disneytown restaurants. Overall we enjoyed our experience. It helped that we all know a little Mandarin Chinese as the majority of the spoken language in performances and rides is in Chinese, with some English translation for ride instructions but no translation for performances or ride monologues/dialogues. There isn’t too much that I would change about how we planned this trip other than eating more meals at Disneytown rather than in the park."

They always give free fast pass, just have to download the app, link your ticket to the apps and check the timing of fast pass. For photo lovers, can consider buying their photo pass and you can download all your pic by scanning your photo pass from all rides you took. Please wait for the fireworks at 8pm, spectacular lighting effect. Choose best time to go, avoid Chinese holiday and try to go on weekday, the rides are not very long.

301,5.0,Dec 2018,"Singapore, Singapore ",Must visit ,"Visit during a weekday and there waa a good number of people but still bearable. The park featured the usual Disney stuff. The must do in my opinion would be the parade, fireworks (if u can brave the cold) crystal gratteo, pirates of the Caribbean ride and fandango performance and maybe tron ride. The most disappointing ride was the soaring over the sky ride partly because of the queue time and most of it was spent in a stuffy enclosed area. The ride was ok. "
302,5.0,Sep 2018,"Hangzhou, China ",A Must Visit for ALL Ages!,"I've been to many different Disney parks in many different countries and this is better than some and not as satisfying as others. The BIG tip... use the Fast Pass and Single Rider opportunities!! Queues can be very long and the waits are excruciating, but if you are willing to go as a Single Rider you can limit those waits by substantial amounts of time. Doing some research before you arrive, and deciding on your priorities regarding rides will help you use the Fast Pass system efficiently - again limiting wait times and queues. Food and drinks are quite expensive - as in common in most theme parks/tourist attractions, but you can bring your own into the park if you so  desire. The metro system takes you directly to the park, making it a very convenient day trip from Shanghai."
303,3.0,Nov 2018,"Shanghai, China ",Good,"Went to visit here on a Sunday and was a spontaneous decision to visit because it was a normal working day as a result of Mr Xi visiting shanghai and of course, China doing great things in shifting working days and days off. It was a gamble to come here with my daughter and it paid off.  Firstly, I purchased tickets on my mobile after I parked the car.  Arriving at the gates. I was asked for my passport.  I turned my Chinese argument mode on with the security staff.  Tip:  if staff makes things difficult, just start making a big fuss and talking loud.  However, I was clam and collective and showed them my driving license, which is the same number as my passport.  They also didn’t really want to accept this method, so they asked if I had a copy on my phone.  Which also I did.  To be honest it’s really backwards this method of entry.  Anyhow we got in the park, and first we went to the TRON rollercoaster.  It was around 9.30-10.00, so there wasn’t that many people. Waiting times were 5 minutes. For this.  Excellent ride and we should have went on this 4-5 more times in a row because of the short queue times.   We went on other rides as well and much noticeable was the pirates of the Caribbean wide was also very good!   All queue times were very short.Food -  complete crap expensive food.  Seriously needs a McDonald’s in there or something.   My advise before going here would be to go during school time and also during the weekdays.   Take a pic of your passport on your phone.   And eat big breakfast before you leave home.      Also o hear when it is cold, Chinese never visit.  "

305,5.0,Jan 2018,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates, ",Read well for first timers,It was my first time in Disneyland ever and it was very emotionally beautiful. Big fan of Disney cartons and it was a dream come true. I was happy thinking I’m going during the week early morning and it would be empty. The place was huge yet there was at least a million visitor from China at early morning. The first ride I waited over 90 minutes to Get in. During the wait and nearly to the time to ride. The game operator asked me if I’m alone I said yes. He said why didn’t you get the single pass or something like that. I said I didn’t know about it. He said with that pass I can enter the rides without waiting in the line. And usually they give you that if you are solo. So if you go to the park make sure you get that pass or even if you are 2 or 3. Better than wasting the whole day in the waiting line. The park is so beautiful and I learnt it’s the latest and most advanced Disney land. Enjoy My favour was Tron and pirates boat
306,5.0,Dec 2018,"Dongguan, China ",Better than expected ,"We had heard stories about 4 hour waits and wall to wall people, but we did not experience any of that. Our family visited the park on a Monday and Tuesday in December. The longest line we had was 40 minutes. Most were around 20. We never used our fast passes, as they were not needed. To get fast passes, you need the mobile app, or you need to go to guest services. Fast passes are not available at the ride itself.  WiFi is available, but was not functional while we were there. If you stay at one of the Disney hotels, you get to use the special side entrance and enter the park 15-20 minutes early. This was totally worth it. We were able to do a ride and get in line for another ride before the general public were able to enter the park. There are four great rides you should check out: The Pirates of the Caribbean - the classic ride mixed with with two IMAX screens for some amazing effects. (Our favorite ride)Soaring over the Horizon - the same as in California adventures, but traveling around the world. Seven Dwarves Mine Train - Basically Thunder Mountain, but a bit smoother tripTron - in place of Space mountain. Much faster, shorter, more lights and you sit on a bike. The park is clean, as the workers quickly clean up the trash many locals just throw on the ground. The bathrooms were clean with both sit down toilets and squatty potties available. Be prepared for a bit of culture shock. Chinese people do not have the western view of personal space and waiting in line. You will be pushed from behind. Just stand your ground. "

Compared to some other parks I've been to, SDL seemed small, don't get me wrong, you'll do tonnes of walking but everything seems spread out, and I was surprised by a lack of rides.Went on a cold wet Sunday in December, so hardly any lines for rides. So you can go in and out of the park, which is great, I went out and ate at Cheesecake Factory and came back in. Had a meal by the restaurant beside the Tron ride too, burgers and fries, it was ok.  If you're into Disney, have kids, like amusement parks or are in Shanghai looking for something to do, go. It's a nice day out. Go early in the day, be there when they open and go on a week day that isn't a Chinese holiday.The Shanghai Metro has a stop 5 minutes from the main entrance, best way to get to and from the park."

We had to pick a particular day but could change the date a maximum of three times. Because of changes in the weather, we did change the date once. We arrived early in the morning and waited a bit to get through security. That proved to be the longest wait we had all day. We were able to enjoy the park for a full twelve hours going from one attraction to another. We had lunch at The Cheesecake Factory and even got a free piece of Cheesecake on our way home. The tickets were much cheaper than in the U.S. Instead of four different parks like in Orlando, Shanghai Disney is one large park, the second largest of all. It is also the newest of the eight parks, having just opened in 2016. Fast passes were available but we never needed them. We watched the closing fireworks as we left.

Do make time and plan for the Tron ride. We went later in the day with much shorter queues and managed to go a few rounds. That would be the highlight of the park. Other notable rides for young kids are Pirates of the Caribbean, Peter Pan and the Dwarf Mines. On a Dec weekday, one day should be enough to cover all the rides and more. Do plan to stay till the end of the day to catch the grand finale fire works, light show and the floats. Its worth the wait and restaurants close about 6, so, you can have dinner before the show. The park is very accessible to and fro by taxis. Do note as we come into the entrance there are many touts selling black market tickets. Just ignore and brush them aside if you not into that."

The castle itself is enormous compared to the one in HK for example. There are some unique attractions I really like for adults - I highly recommend the Tron and Pirates attractions. Compared to other Disney though, they don't have the parade but instead have a show in front of the castle with the disney characters. It's a new Disney experience for me as we've always see the parade in all the parks we've been to. We went on a December on a weekend and the crowd was actually ok. On the first day (Sat) attractions had an average waiting time of 30-40 mins. On the next day, I was actually quite surprise that waiting for example the Tron ride was just 5 mins (though I guess the forecast of rain played a factor on this). Lastly, I believe that Disney Shanghai really got a bad pressed from people who are quick to imposed there cultural bias on the Chinese. I read a lot of reviews even before it was open and the first year it opened and a lot of it were negative  reviews.  A lot of it I believe are just cultural difference. Sure, there are people who cut on lines or ""forget"" to throw their trash properly but it's not as if it's a rampant practice where we use it as a generalization of their behavior. I actually find the park quite clean during our visit with a lot of street cleaners cleaning up the leaves from the maple tree (I'm guessing it's a maple tree here) and rarely did I see trashes lying around or people ""squatting"" on park. People were generally nice and accommodating though there's a bit of language barrier (for us) as not many speak English and we don't speak Chinese. I don't find this a negative  at all as some would have as I've seen on some of the reviews. We were able to get by with the communication part and it's not as if English is their first (or even second language) so I just hope people can respect that when we visit other countries even if its a Disneyland. Overall, it was a great experience and would recommend it to anyone who ask"
320,5.0,Nov 2018,London ,So. Much. Fun,"We went on a Tuesday, we went early and it was EMPTY! The only ride we waited for was Soaring over the Horizon (45mins). Everything else we got fast passes for easily (get the app!) and then by 3pm, we didn't even need them. We rode Tron 8 times and only once with fast pass. The longest we queued for Tron was ten minutes - the best Disney ride I've ever been on by the way.Make sure you stay for the end of day fireworks ( but be prepared for the bundle of people to leave the park!)Try and go during the week and you won't be disappointed.

There was no language barrier issues and the locals love it all as much as the west does ! "
322,5.0,Nov 2018,"Singapore, Singapore ",Really enjoyable day with lots to do and take photo of!,"Got a 2 day pass and went during the weekend. The queue were surprisingly short or almost not existent! Tron and pirates of the Caribbean rides were really the highlight! Download the shanghai Disneyland app to maximize your stay from getting fast pass, seeing live time Q minutes and map reference. We enjoyed ourselves a lot and the park is really well maintained and litter free."
323,5.0,Nov 2018,"Vancouver, Canada, ",Great Disneyland,"We've hit up LA Disney, Tokyo Disney, Hong Kong Disney, and here. It's great here. We came during the middle of the week and it rained so it was EMPTY. Pirates of the Caribbean ride is amazing, way better than LA. The Tron ride is AMAZING, we rode it 10 times that day, it is THE best ride in all of Disney. Definitely ride Tron. The seven dwarf ride is good too but Tron stole the show. The buzz lightyear ride also is great. It has stronger lasers which get your aim dead spot."
324,5.0,Nov 2018,N/A,It's Disneyland,Went on a Friday and was still very busy but certainly not packed. Only a couple of rides with hour plus waits. Got on nearly all rides and a couple twice. Get the App (QR code everywhere) it gives you a map and live updates on wait times. Got to most of the performances but they are in Chinese. Food is expensive. A great day.
325,5.0,Nov 2018,"Mount Juliet, TN ",Family of 6 plus four take on Disney in Shanghai. ,This place was the best of the best. It is huge and takes a while to get where you are going. We have visited all the parks except for Tokyo and we are impressed. Staying in the Disneyland hotel is a must to be able to have a chance of getting it all done. You enter right nest to the entrance and can ride it before the crowd gets in. And it is a must. Then head to pirates and Soaring. If done early enough you can ride these three before the lines get out of control. Download and use the app for fast passes. They work well and will shorten your wait times. Eating before 11:30 is a must or you will spend an hour trying to order. The best place to eat is the tangled tavern. Good plates and very filling. 
326,4.0,Nov 2018,"Lafayette, IN ","Several ""best of Disney"" attractions, but hard work","We have visited every Disney park in the world, including 4 different locations a total of 6 times since last March. Shanghai, which we have now visited twice, has several ""bests"" in the Disney system. The Tron attraction is amazing--a vehicle unlike any other Disney ride, and an immersive experience that is a pleasure even if you've never seen the movie Tron. Pirates of the Caribbean keeps the heritage of the old ride but takes it to a completely new and amazing level. The Camp Discovery trail is also unique to the Disney system, sort of an adventure course that is a lot of fun with different challenge level options. The park is immense--by far the biggest park in the Disney system.  Getting from place to place can take forever. Fastpasses are all via app, which works fairly well. Disney hotel guests can enter the park early through the Disneytown entrance, which is a HUGE perk. When we were here last March, that wasn't the case yet and we had to fight the huge security lines to get in. Our family group of 10 (ages 4-48) managed fine, but it does require a certain level of fitness and commitment. The food (not surprisingly) is primarily Asian, and part of group unaccustomed to Asian food found it difficult to find things they liked to eat in the park.  The Mickey and Minnie ice cream bars, however, pleased everyone. It's a lot cheaper than the American parks, and absolutely worth the trip if you can make it. But it was a little more of a trip than a vacation. Still, we've done it twice, so that tells you something!"
327,5.0,Jul 2018,"San Francisco, CA, ",Go if you love Disney!!,"The park was only about 2 years old when we visited this July. Definitely a very popular place to go. It is about an hour ride on the subway from Central Shanghai- Line 11 (maroon)- ride to the end of the line at the Disney Resort.  It is a good idea to try and buy a round-trip return ticket back for later in the day to avoid long line waiting.  The ticket booths are at the stations.  Plan to walk for more than 10 minutes to lines to get your bags x-ray, then another 5 minutes or so to the ""Steamboat Willie"" bronze statue. From there, it is another 10 min.  line to exchange your ticket voucher for a ticket.  Please remember to bring your passports to process your tickets as they actually do not let you to ticket except as a group-- they handle each person 1 by 1 in an orderly line!! Everyone is very patient to wait for their turn. Summer hours are 8a.m.- 10p.m.-- Fast passes were out by 8:30a.m. for many of the popular rides.  Long lines were building by 8:30a.m.  For example, we headed to Soarin' and by 8:30a.m.- sign indicated it was about a 2 1/2 hour wait.  We did not believe it but by the time we exited the ride, it was nearly 10:50a.m.-- definitely a good prediction of time for waiting.You actually need to ask for a map at the Information Station: they do not distribute them when you exchange your ticket for entry. Also, do check online for the current schedule of entertainment before coming as they do not list the time schedule for it. There was a huge/long line down Mickey Avenue which is equivalent to Main St. USA. The popular rides- Tron, Snow White & 7 Dwarfs Mine Train, Soarin' were a long 2 hr plus wait in line. Fast passes are often all distributed first thing in the morning as many pre-purchase the additional Fast pass app.  We just felt fortunate to have the experience to visit Disneyland Shanghai and went along with the flow to enjoy the surroundings, It worked out well for us as we did not have high expectations, knowing that a typical summer day is very crowded, especially on a Saturday.It is a huge park for sure-- check out the Garden of Imagination- it is the only Disney Park to have this-- Disney characters represent each of the 12 Chinese New year astrology animals -- the pictures are all made from pieces of tile!!Since the park is 1/2 owned by China and 1/2 by Disney, I must admit that they did a wonderful partnership to have original Disney characters/rides alongside Chinese restaurants.  They are very high tech as it is the newest of Disney's parks. The Pirate of Caribbean ride is not to be missed-- after 2 drops- you land in the ride like you are immersed in water!  Also, ""Eye of the Storm"" Pirates of the Caribbean show with Johnny Depp as Capt. Jack Sparrow is worth the wait-- check the schedule for times. You are standing during the preview and in the auditorium, there are plenty of great special effects during the entire 30 min.-- it is all in Mandarin but easy to follow what is going on.It is well worth to see Mickey's Storybook Express Parade- no need to find a spot earlier as it is a long parade route around the park.  You will be able to see it anywhere along the route. The floats are nice and depict ""Mulan"".  The Storybook boats equivalent  in the Disney parks to -- ""Voyage to Crystal's Grotto""- with lifesize depiction of ""Beauty & the Beast"", ""Aladdin"", ""Mulan"" ""Little Mermaid"", & ""Fantasia.""All in all, plan a full day here if you come. It is worth a visit but prepare for crowds, long lines-- go early -- there is so much to see and do, no need to go to popular rides along-- Toy Store Land rides were only about 10-15 min wait-- like Slinky Dog Spin, and Woody's Round Up.Another word of advice, when leaving at night, you may need to ask for directions with the staff on the grounds as signs are not clear which way is to the Subway station. The subway ride back was very efficient and on time."
328,5.0,Nov 2018,"San Francisco, CA ",No lines,"Now is a good time to go, went on weekday, 399 4rmb per person about $55 way cheaper than the US Disney parks. Everything is in Chinese, but if you know Disney, you will understand it. Did the best rides like tron, soring, and pirates. The plays were excellent too, Tarzan and pirates. Park was relaxing and not too crowded. App gave updates on wait times and you can book fast track."
329,5.0,Oct 2018,N/A,"35,000 steps 7am 'til late","~not as busy as expected. We bought tickets online for the Wednesday before National week. As it was neither a weekend or a holiday they were significantly cheaper.~There were certainly crowds at the entrance and we worried, after reading other reviews, we were in the wrong queue but don't fret, it's right its just a lengthy security check.~There's a massive selection of dining options in Disneytown, whereas there are many in the park, Disneytown is better. Unfortunately we discovered it too late and as it means leaving the park I could not tell you about exit/re entry queues. Folks who don't love Chinese food and Chinese adjacent food will appreciate the greater selection there.~The premium fast pass was excellent and we were still able to use free fast passes. By the end of the day we required neither for The Tron and the kids rode it 6 times. We could not get back on 'Soaring' however. Btw, kids clearly loved Tron (the photo is the free car racing game) while I adored 'Soaring' and regret not selecting that fast pass earlier. ~Great toilets and free water was appreciated.~'They' ask you to remain seated for the light show but as you've probably not been able to find a seat unless you arrived really, really early, it can be a mission getting out. But we chose to leave early as it's not very special. ~Including walking from our airbnb in Hongkou to the subway then home again we clocked 35,000 steps and did not even really notice because it was so fun~Subway was easy peasy to navigate but as with everywhere in China I recommend Baidu Maps. Cut and paste your destination in Chinese (from Wikipedia/TripAdvisor etc) and Baidu Maps gives you all the transport options public. ~I wonder if folks critical of pushing and queue jumping grossly exaggerate. We saw none of that but if the kids hadn't sneakily stood on rubbish bins we would not have seen the parades. "

332,5.0,Nov 2018,"De Pere, WI ",One if the better Disney parks,"This park is great! Having been to all of the Disney parks except Paris, this is my favorite castle park. I still prefer Tokyo Disney Resort due to the Japanese culture and DisneySea, but this park is amazing. Pirates is the best one they have done, TRON is awesome, and Buzz Lighter is way better. We did encounter people selling knock off Disney items on the metro line and in the park just before the fireworks started, but they didn't come up to us foreigners. Don't miss this Disney Park!"
333,5.0,Nov 2018,"Crib Point, Australia ",A visit from Mum and 2 kids ,My cherubs and I took a taxi from our hotel to Shanghai Disneyland. The taxi drops you off on one side of a walking bridge. The walk to the park is exciting as one can see Cinderella's castle and Tomorrowland.We didn't prepay tickets online. Purchasing tickets was easy. We lined up for the bag search and were then ushered to the ticket booth. We paid an equivalent to $210 AUD for 3 adult tickets.  My cherubs loved the park. Rides and rules were described in Chinese and English. We navigated the park map very well. The place was clean and staff very friendly. Catching a taxi back to our hotel was easy: Line D just outside the park. 
334,5.0,Nov 2018,"Orlando, FL, ",Beautiful park,"This new Disney park is delightful . It is over a year old and still sparking new . It is located on a large piece of land which makes the park seem open and inviting . For English speaking people , the park can be challenging . The signage is weak and many staff do not speak English . It was challenging navigating the area without the paper map. The food is mostly Chinese except for a few things like pizza . There are a few unique rides like Tron and the hot wheels ride for Toy Story . Unlike my US Disney experiences , the staff is plentiful but not very engaging even bossy . Fast passes are available at the information kiosks . "
335,5.0,Nov 2018,"Shanghai, China ",Fun for all,We avoided the crowds by going on a Monday outside of any Chinese holidays. The longest wait was for the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at 40 mins but well worth it. Spectacular.  THE Tron was another favourite.  Plenty to entertain children of all ages. The shows as you expect are crowded and in Chinese. Worth a one day visit. We live in Shanghai and will probably look to come twice a year.  Food of course is over priced and security check to make sure you are not bringing your own food in to the park. And don't forget to check out the incredible Lego shop in Disney Town.
336,5.0,Nov 2018,"London, UK ",Superb park,"We visited on a Friday with nice clear sunny weather. We arrived at the park at about 8am having used the metro. This is the best way to get to the park. It costs less than $1 from city centre and the station is right outside the entry. The queues had started already to get into the park. The only way to avoid this queue is to not take a bag. But I recommend turning up early as we didn’t get through the gates til about 0905 due to X-ray and search regime. Price - £40 is decent price for a Disney park. Despite hating them, we actually paid the additional £25 for premium fast pass. £6-8 per person for the “dog food” served in the restaurant. Probably best going to Disneytown which is a one minute walk from the park and go to a restaurant Fast pass - it was clear from the initial queuing to get into the park that some “cultural differences” in “queuing etiquette” may cause me some “minor” frustration during the day. And so whilst I morally object to fast pass systems and have never used them anywhere in the world before and won’t again, I wasn’t willing to tolerate the unauthorised queue jumping and so to avoid we got fast pass. We probably didn’t need it but it did mean the day was less stressful. Park - I think it’s the best Disney I’ve been to (having been to LA, Florida, Paris). TRON was the best ride ever and went on it four times. I recommend asking the staff to go on the front row. Nobody else asked so we went front row every time. Soaring horizon is also amazing. Pirates of Caribbean is the best we’ve been on. If you do just a little bit of planning you will get round all rides - mine train and soaring horizon seemed the busiest so do them early. Make sure you download the app. Food - they don’t let you take food in which REALLY annoys me particularly when they only offer a single vegetarian meal throughout the entire park which is frankly comparable to dog food. Disney let’s itself down - offer better vegetarian options if you are going to prohibit food being brought in. Staff - like most attractions Ive visited in China, they are miserable! They obviously missed the magic briefing that morning. We loved the day and I think it is probably the best park I’ve been to. That said I can’t compare it to other Asian Disney resorts. "
337,5.0,Oct 2018,"Springdale, AR ","Can do in a day, check out my tips. Wish I had known a couple things","1. You do need your passport. Its not a you might you do.2. You can only register and get the tickets in advance via the app and you are confirmed via text not email, so if you dont have cell service, which I never do to escape, you wont be able to buy the tickets through the app in advance and thus have to wait in long lines.3. You can easily get here from downtown shanghai via subway. Takes a little bit but it is very simple , even for the uninhibited.4. The lockers buy TRON dont seem to work, but you dont need them. The sign says you do, but bring your stuff and they have a container you can put your belongings in and thus same some headaches and some money.Overall a nice clean fun park. The Pirates of the Carribean steals the show. It is epic. If you have been on it at other parks and figure they are all the same, Ill skip it you will really be missing out. The others dont compare.You can get decent priced food in the Dowtown Disney area outside the park and there is easy access to get back in.Overall, this is well worth a one day side trip from shanghai. Exceeded my expectations."
338,5.0,Nov 2018,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ",Good crowd,"We went one day after the public holiday in Shanghai. Went on a Wednesday. No crowd at all, only downside it was raining. However, the rides continue to open and we queue less than 0-10 minutes for each ride.It was really a good experience as I expected huge crowd in Disneyland. Toilets are really clean, no pushing in lines.  Ride Tron twice and tried most of the rides, even the kiddy ones!"
339,5.0,Jul 2018,"Irving, TX ",Remarkable. ,A lot less busy than anticipated which was very nice. Very modern and clean. Has an amazing Pirates ride that is a must for any Disney Park fan. I would say that ride in itself is my absolute favorite Disney ride I’ve been on. 
340,4.0,Nov 2018,"Clark Freeport Zone, Philippines ",Chinese Disneyland,"This is our fourth Disney park to visit, after Anaheim, Tokyo, and Hong Kong.  It is the same size as HK.  We went there on a Thursday to avoid the crowd.  True enough, the longest waiting time is at the Discovery Camp at 40 minutes.  We  rode Tron Lightcycle Power Run four times, each time the waiting time is 5 to 10 minutes.  If there is a reason to come back to Shanghai Disney, it will be this attraction.The line to security check is really long.  To avoid this, you have to enter the park with no bags whatsoever for checking, so that you can proceed straight inside the park.I was expecting a special train going to the park after getting down from the metro similar to HK, but there was none.  From the metro station, it's a 10-minute walk to the security check.My daughter wasn't interested with any of the shows since they're in Chinese, she surmised.Over-all, it's a Disney Park I would like to visit again in the future."
341,4.0,Oct 2018,N/A,Magical Visit to Disneyland Shanghai ,"We enjoyed a wonderful day at Disneyland Shanghai.  We found it uncrowded and much cheaper than in the USA.  It has similarities to Disneyland Anaheim but it is roomed and much larger. This is nice but it does mean there is more walking between attractions. We loved checking other Disneyland Shanghai and comparing it to the USA. It was Disney, but with a nice Chinese feel. We felt it was a good value for foreign tourists."
342,3.0,Oct 2018,N/A,Shanghai disneyland,Beautiful and serene. Great activities for family. The only negative comment is the parking policy. We were dropped off by our friend and after our visit we walked to the parking lot to await our pickup. But the attendants did not allow cars to enter the parking area hence young kids and families had to take a long walk to the main road to reach their personal vehicles.

Even though it's on Monday (apaprently it's on national holiday due to Shanghai Expo)Parades are so joyful. Attractions are fun. Foods are great.Make sure you bring extra money, souvenirs in Shanghai Disneyland are different from other countries. A lot of limited editions only in Shanghai. Make sure you start queueing at 7pm for the 8.30pm fireworks show in front of the castle.They will have the line ready and its so organisedCustomer services there are helpful, even though their English language are super limited"
344,4.0,Nov 2018,"New Delhi, India ",Great but crowded even on weekday,"I went to Shanghai Disneyland on a weekday and yet it was so crowded (may be due to Halloween) but is is beautiful.My kid enjoyed a lot, I haven't seen any other Disneyland before so cannot compare but it was beautiful and colorful."
345,4.0,Nov 2018,"Wellington, New Zealand ",Pleasantly surprised,"I’m an avid Disneyland fan and have been to the USA ones 10 times, so I was a little dubious to go to my first one outside of there, but I have been pleasantly surprised by Shanghai Disney. The park was quieter than I was expecting which was good, bud I still purchased the premier fast pass set for 275 yuan as I didn’t want to wait any longer than necessary, and it also meant I got to ride some rides multiple times. Tron is a great, thrill seekers ride (i liken it to space mountain in LA), I recommend doing it at least once during the day and at night. Pirates of the Caribbean was a real surprise for me as it’s even better than the original ride in LA!The park is very clean and well maintained. I haven’t had an issue with people pushing in as others have mentioned.The biggest downside is the cost as it feels like everything is expensive. The nighttime display of fireworks was the most disappointing thing about the park, it does not compare to the USA.I stayed at Toy Story hotel and you get early entrance to the park via the Disneytown entrance, approx 30mins earlier than the general public and it was nice not having to queue at the main entrance.Overall i have been impressed with this Disney, but note that it does not have the same sparkle as the US parks."
346,5.0,Dec 2017,United States ,Great Disney Experience,"Shanghai Disney (SD) is a great opportunity to experience a Disney park. Although this park isn't as big as Anaheim or Orlando, it does offer rides that other parks do not have like Tron. Tron is a MUST if you are visiting SD. The park offers all fun edible treats that other parks have like Mickey Mouse ice cream head. SD has honey pots (tea cups), Snow White ride, and pirates of the Caribbean. My overall suggestion - visit the park in the off season and during the week. Download the park app that helps you track the ride times and allows you to book slots for the rides. If possible, ride the single lines even if you are in a group. We found that some rides that had longer lines, it was faster to go through the lines in the single rider lines. I also recommend going first thing in the morning, when the park opens. There are more characters out as well. The app also helps you determine where the characters are in the park, so you can navigate your way to the characters. Travel recommendation - you can take the subway straight to SD. Watch your bags and carry them IN FRONT OF YOU AT ALL TIMES! The subway system gets very busy and you can easily be pickpocketed. DO NOT talk with people trying to sell you stuff. The Castle --- so beautiful!! Stay for the end fireworks and show. Its truly is one of a kind."

We had a good day and got on all rides we wanted to. Tron, woodies race track, mine rollercoaster faves. Pirates is different to the USA one. Much better. All in all great day. Tip... Go without a bag of you can as this is what takes time to get into ground we arrives just after 8am and didn't get into park till after 9am due to slowness and Q's. "
348,5.0,Oct 2018,"Auckland Central, New Zealand ",The best day ever! NZ couple,We were staying near The Bund and were able to catch the train (transferring lines twice) to the park. Which was super easy!We arrived just before 9am thinking we were super late (as the park opens at 8.30am) and walked down to the entrance which took about 5-10minutes. Then we hoped into a line for bag check which is compulsory everywhere you go in China. This took about 30-45mins. We then found out we couldn’t buy tickets on the gate so quickly downloaded the ‘Disney Resort’ app (recommend you download before you go). Tickets for a 1Day pass are 575 RMB each. They scan your passport and you’re in. The app conveniently updates you on waiting times for the rides so you can plan your day. And by using the app to book tickets you gain 1 fast pass. Highlights:TRON Lightcycle Power RunSeven Dwarfs Mine TrainPirates of the Caribbean (dialogue in Mandarin but really cool none the less)Roaring Rapids (bring a poncho you’re going to get wet! Or they sell them for 10RMB)Soaring over the Horizon (the coolest VR experience)Other cool experiences:Camp discovery - avoid if you don’t like heightsAlice in Wonderland MazeVoyage to the Crystal Grotto (the child in me loved this - dialogue also in Mandarin but it didn’t even matter the music kind of takes over.)Parade at about 5pm Honey Pot Spin Food = expensive. But you can’t bring outside food into the park. So just a heads up. We asked the guides who mostly spoke English before we joined any queues about the language barrier of each ride. It was an insanely cool day! We went on a Wednesday and the lines were pretty good. Ranging between 30-45min. Although there were a lot of things that were only 5-10min. The park opened in 2016 so everything is super clean. Really well maintained. This was our first Disneyland experience and it definitely lived up to expectations despite the language barrier. 100% recommend!!
349,1.0,Nov 2018,"Moscow, Russia ",Terrible day and experience ,We bought our tickets in advance.But be there 8:00 or come without bag as you need minimum 1 hour to cross security control.Then you are entering and understanding that you can not get free fast past or only for evening time...The only one solution (if you have smartphone) is to buy extra sets that costs 175 yuan per person!Moreover attractions are very often non available for “maintenance “ problems...So don’t go there the Disney Land in Europe or Hong Kong are far better...
350,4.0,Oct 2018,"Long Beach, CA ",So easy and fun,"After reading reviews I was worried this park was going to be huge and busy and one day wasn’t going to be enough, but it is so much more manageable than Disneyland in Anaheim. First of all, there aren’t very many rides here...second of all I read a review that said it’s a “trek” getting from one side of the park to the other. It took us maybe 10-12 minutes. We stayed at Toy Story hotel and arrived this morning (Halloween) at around 8:30am. It’s 1pm and we have gone on all but one of the “big rides” and had a break in Disneytown for a sit down lunch. Longest wait so far has been 20 minutes. There is hardly anyone here and I really can’t inagine how much more there is to see! It’s  lots of open land and picnic areas....they need more rides but the ones they do have are much better than in CA. Overall I would say come in late Oct if you want zero crowds. A good time, but not as magical as Disneyland back home."
351,5.0,Oct 2018,N/A,Shanghai Disney,"The Shanghai Disney was very nice, clean. This park did not quite have the feeling with it. Park staff although helpful and nice, looked unhappy and may be bored. Staff just didn't fit in with the feeling of a Disney park. We would hope they are paid well as prices are geared for tourists and western costs."
352,5.0,Oct 2018,N/A,Wonderful,We visited mid-October which was a perfect time for us to visit. The weather was cool and low level of crowds. The longest wait time we saw was around 70mins for the seven dwarves train. We were able to ride all the rides we wanted without having to bank and exhaust the fast pass system. Downloading the app ahead of time is a MUST as it allows you to see the current wait times as well as your fast pass times. You can also purchase premier fast passes on it if you wish. Tron and Pirates is a must ride as their so different and unique from all the other parks! We had no problems with wifi and all the staff were quite pleasant although few spoke English.
353,4.0,Oct 2018,"Glasgow, UK ",My 3rd and not my last,This was my third trip to a Disney park having covered Paris and Florida and Shanghai holds its own. The staff try hard considering they speak no English. So prepare for that.  Reasons for 4 stars - the queues with Chinese are weird they just skip lines and all think it’s normal. Go midweek as it’s so quiet. 1 day is too short and 2 is too much. Food is hit or miss - we loved the wandering moon bbq. avoid salty popcorn as it’s like a weird salted caramel - not greatAdvice - get fast pass if you can or buy the premier. It’s a God send. Worth waiting for is soaring and TRON as the experience is all part of it. Single rider all the way for the dwarves mine. Must dos - don’t waste our time on the crystal grotto during the day but YOU MUST go at night what a truly magical experience. And pirates of the Caribbean  is amazing too. Must see is the fairytale show and also the fireworks for the awesome display of lights and Tarzan! To Disney - put some English subtitles up - how hard would it be...
354,3.0,Oct 2018,N/A,“Dorthy I don’t think we are in Kansas any more.”,"Were to start? I think the title say’s it all. As a former Disneyland employee I had high expectations or warm friendly service, highly organized staff and experiencing as slice of America in a distant land. After living in China for eight year I should have realized I would be slapped hard in the face that Chinese people don’t understand the Disney brand. It’s all started with downloading their app and purchasing tickets online. It was a birthday celebration so I went all out purchasing the concierge package. I should have read the fine print. First, Shanghai Disneyland is not close to downtown. It’s an 45 min or 1.5 hour subway depending where are staying in downtown. When arriving at the park and picking up my $286 passes (for two people) I was informed the special concierge pass did not include the entrance ticket fee. What! Plus I had to go to a different area away from the ticket center to pick up my concierge passes. So I had to fork out an additional 165$ (for two people.) After walking to the concierge location and picking up the tickets I was given a map with had written notes on where and what to see. Everything highlighted was nothing different than what a regular guest would see or do. The concierge pass was a total rip off. Disney sell the pass as “create your own story”. I did create my own story of being ripped off by the park. The park was ok, characters roped off with long lines, half way through Mickeys afternoon parade the music stoped working so the characters were dancing along as if it was a normal experience. The best three rides were “Splash mountain, Tron, and Pirates.” Unless your bucket list lists seeing all Disney theme parks, I would suggest passing on Disney Shanghai. Disneyland Shanghai is definitely not “The happiest place on earth.”"
355,3.0,Oct 2018,"Brentwood, TN ",Average - hence the 3 stars ,We purchased a VIP tour which was nice but not worth the price paid.  Wasn’t too crowded.  Doesn’t have the ‘magic’ as the Orlando parks (and we were passholders there).  Tron ok.  But it ain’t rockin’ rollercoaster by any stretch.  The cultural experience was interesting.  Chinese are a very nice people.

357,4.0,Oct 2018,N/A,"Happily ever after, but only in Chinese","The park is designed just as the other park in Europe, with loads of fun rides and plenty of things to do. We had only one day to tour the place, but unless you're seriously addicted to Disney (or to amusement parks) it is more than enough.Only minus was that so many attractions were Chinese-only (Pooh's stories, Stitch, etc). Apart from that, and maybe from the (very) high prices for food inside the park, the place is great."
358,2.0,Oct 2018,N/A,Can see a queen faster than seeing a Disney princess,"With no information about time n time limit to wait for a princess to show up m take a photo, children about 2-4 years old forced to stand n wait for 1.5 hours is bad management n inconsiderate n uncaring for children. Manager has no clue has to it’s time table as well which shows bad care n system in place for all guests especially children. Bad management shanghai Disney.  All other elements of the Disneyland has been enjoyable."
359,1.0,Oct 2018,"Beijing, China, ",People Mountain People Sea,"Went there with friends for a day. Not impressed. Overcrowded. Overpriced. You wait for everything. Firework show was excellent but once it ends, they kick you out of the park. Might as well just watch it on Youtube and save yourself the money of going here. Not the happiest place on Earth by any means. If you drive, expect to walk 1.5 KM to get to the gate, no shuttle either. The characters were friendly, that's all I will say. Main point: Skip it and do something else with your family!"
360,4.0,Sep 2018,"Beijing, China ",Choose the right time to visit,"We have only been to one other Disneyland, the HK Disneyland. Is this better?Personally, i don't think there is much of a difference, it is much more important to choose the right time to go so that you don't have to fight with the crowds.Having said that, some of the rides are very simple , just a simple boat ride and paddle your own canoe.Must rides are Winnie the Pooh (the same as HK), Peter Pan, and Pirates of the Caribbeans.Shanghai Disney App is a must download. You can use it to find directions, timing of events and most importantly use it to book the FastPass and monitor the Queue length.We were there just before the Oct Golden Week, on a weekday. The longest queue whilst we were there is 40 mins. I had a look at the apps during the Golden Week holiday and several queue exceeded 100 mins !!Disney Hotel guests can access the park from an exclusive entrance. If you use this entrance in the morning, turn LEFT upon entering the park to access the rides furthest from the main gate. This way you don't have to fight with the general public entering from the main gate at the rides closest to the main gate."
361,5.0,Oct 2018,"North Finchley, UK ",A unique Disney experience,"This is our second Disney park, and it was a fantastic experience! We visited for 2 days just after golden week, and even though the park was busy, pretty much all rides for the 2 days were walk on! Longest time we waited for a ride was about 15 mins.Must do rides include Roaring Rapids, Challenge Trails, Soaring, Buzz Lightyear, Seven Dwarfs and of course Tron and Pirates!Remy’s Patisserie was our go to for on the go snacks. Tangled Tree Tavern Chicken Feast was great for a family of 4, but stay away from the Stargazer Grill Family Feast...too fatty!Saw both the Tarzan and Pirates show. Both were great, but the Pirates show was the highlight.Crowd culture was fine, even though I expected the worst.Overall a very enjoyable 2 days."
362,5.0,Nov 2017,"Lahaina, United States ",A MUST for Disney fans,"On a rainy mid-week day in late November, the opening entry line was long but the only waits were for canoes, Soaring and turkey legs (?!?).  I saw fewer than 20 Westerners the entire day (mostly in the Soaring line).  Generally I had no difficulties communicating - the staff who could speak English were very eager to engage and practice their English; the ones who could not would nervously look around for someone who could.  Signs are in English, however ride and show narration is not, which did not bother me.   There is much more open space than in most Disney parks (deliberately designed that way because so much of Shanghai and urban China is densely populated).  The Downtown Disney equivalent includes a Cheesecake Factory, huge Starbucks and Wolfgang Puck and many Western stores - it felt too Americanized to be enjoyable for me.Tips: 1. Download the app BEFORE you get to the park - I tried to do it there and although it said it loaded, I could not get it to work.2. Expect crowds and multiple lines at park opening.  First you queue to get through security.  Then you queue to buy your ticket.  Then you queue to enter (and they hold you back, only permitting 5-8 people to even approach the entry turnstile at a time).  I got there about 45 minutes before park opening and there were about 80 people ahead of me in line.3.  I was nervous about the signs indicating ""no outside food or drink"" so I spent my time in line eating most of the snacks I had brought for the day (in lieu of breakfast), however when I went through security  I didn't see them enforcing it for anyone.3. Passports are required for park ticket purchases, unlike the U.S.  Fortunately I had mine with me.4.  I took the subway there from downtown - would probably have been faster to take a cab.  It's a fairly long walk from the metro station to the park, however it's through a park and very scenic (though not much shade if you're coming in summer).5.  I stopped on the way to the airport for a late flight.  There is a place for you to leave bags near the entrance (after security but I don't remember if it was before or after the ticket window (in Hong Kong there is a bag check before you get near the park)).6.  It's fine for solo travelers.7. Characters are much more popular than in the U.S. parks - if you see a group of teenagers running, it's likely a new character has come out.8.  Tron is very good but short.  There is a place before you board where you can leave your bags; you don't need to use the lockers.9.  Yes, Pirates is everything people say it is.  Truly amazing and relatively short lines. DO NOT MISS IT!!!10.  Soaring has a different front story (English subtitles) which is interesting culturally but the ride and video is identical to CA and Epcot so unless you have time or a fast pass, you might want to pass on it.11.  The ropes course is daunting and something you'll never see in the U.S. parks.  Due to the rain, I didn't try it.  The line to store your things can be longer than the line for the course - if you have someone in your group to watch your things (must empty pockets), leave them and just get in the course line (3 levels of difficulty).12.  Shopping - I looked in several shops but saw nothing I wanted to buy.  I have heard that the merchandise is different in each Asian park so what you see here you probably can't buy in Hong Kong.13. The Disney zodiac symbols are unique.14.  The murals in the castle are beautiful."
363,4.0,Aug 2018,"San Mateo, CA ",Day at Shanghai Disney!,"Shanghai Disney was on list of things to do/see on our recent trip to China! After reading other reviews, we bought our tickets online and I downloaded the Shanghai Disney App. We arrived to the park around a little before opening at 8am and waited about 5 minutes to enter the park. NOTE: We are from California and frequent visitors of Disneyland in Anaheim so we were prepared for a full 12 hour day in the park! Upon entering, we were unable to connect to the WiFi (even with a VPN, we had no way to get the code sent to our US phone number and could not get assistance accessing the WiFI) **** HUGE BUMMER as this meant no access to the App - wait times, show times, fast passes etc. We put the lack of WiFi aside, grabbed a park map and remembered we are at DISNEY & just enjoy it. Since we didn't have the access to Fast Pass - we walked straight to Tron as this was one of the top things to do. The wait was only 25 minutes and is one of the BEST rides ever. We ended up riding it 4 times that day!  The other main attraction rides had pretty short wait times as well which helped us let go of the anxiety of the long line reviews we had read. Weather: HOT & HUMID. We visited in August which wasn't ideal.. so lots of water and thank goodness for the AC in the rides/storesFood:It is primarily Chinese food but decently priced and tastyMUST Do Rides:Tron Lightcycle Pirates of the Caribbean Language:Everyone speaks Mandarin but really nice Cast Members!In the end, we spent about 7 hours in the park and about an hour walking around their Disneytown. Shanghai Disney was worth our visit and so glad we were able to see it!"
364,4.0,Oct 2018,N/A,Nice day out....Except for food,"I would like to offer my recommendations. Get a FAST PASS for Tron Light Cycle and Pirates of the Caribbean. These are the most worth it attractions. Also, do not miss the Tarzan Acrobats show. It was the best one and had no language barrier. As far as the food, it was meat+ rice or  meat+noodles (all fast food). There are no vegetarian options. So if you want to have a proper meal you can go to DisneyTown which is directly outside the exit. They will let you re-enter by simply showing your ticket. Aside from the crowds, stares on the lines, and the occasional yell of ""foreigner"" it was a good day.  P.S Dont forget your passport."
365,4.0,Nov 2017,"Singapore, Singapore ",Disneyland just keeps getting bigger,"I was in Shanghai for business, and my children ordered me to check out Disneyland for them on my day off. So I arranged for my translator to bring me. This was essential. The crowds, and the cast are mush easier to navigate if you have a local dialect speaker with you. The queues were long, and littered with con artists selling fake tickets, goods and passes... only purchase from INSIDE booths. the themeing is wonderful, and the rides are great. the park does need some expanding, so there is not a lot of variety right now. The tron ride was VERY SMOOTH, and the new Pirates of the Caribbean ride is like nothing I've experienced! It was incredible. The marvel area was a little disappointing as it wasn't very interactive. "
366,4.0,Dec 2017,"Singapore, Singapore ",Fascinating & Magical,"Visited last Dec during one's of the weekday. It was a thrilling adventure for our kids and our parents being 1st timer visiting Disneyland, were captivated by it. The resort was huge, clean & staffs were helpful., Everyone was queuing orderly even though  most of the rides needed 30 mins of waiting time. Tron ride left deepest impression, it really get your adrenaline going! When the resort was lighted up in the night, the whole place looked enchanting."
367,5.0,Sep 2018,"Canberra, Australia ",Magical Disney Day,"Just came back from China and spent a day with my wife in Disneyland 10am-9:30pm (Phew). What can I say about one of the biggest Disneylands in the world (💯 Awesome) ! There is a long walk from the front to the park ( Mickey Ave) however, it's so clean and organised and we enjoyed our marathon day. Most rides were great a few let downstairs Peter Pan but Tron & Soaring over the Horizon and Pirates of the Caribbean made-up for it. We had Premier Passes (a must) makes it easy to bypass queues in popular rides. It also enabled us to have front row seats for the Disney Light Spectacular at 8:20pm in front of the castle but take your own pillow as there are no seats ? The food was good the Turket Drum stick good value. All in all a great day out."
368,5.0,Sep 2018,N/A,Mesmerizing,Its was all thw way worth it.the rides at the TrOn side were amazing.didnt like the fact every show was in chinese and I couldn’t get a glimpse of what they were saying.but the place was huge abd the fireworks were spectacular beside the fact that its always crowded due to this country’s popoulation
369,5.0,Sep 2018,"Las Vegas, NV ",Incredible Disney Experience!,"I’ve been to every Disney resort on the planet except for the one in Paris. I would rank this resort a close third after Tokyo and California. The resort is huge, with large walking paths. The attractions are top notch… Highlights include Pirates of the Caribbean and Tron.  The staff is fantastic and we found that most of them were able to communicate fairly well in English.  Food was very good, with a wide variety to choose from.  The cleanliness of the resort was exactly what you expect from Disney… Everything was sparkling.  Guest behavior for the most part was just fine, despite all of the negative press this has received.  I would highly recommend this resort anyone who is a fan of Disney and finds themselves in Shanghai."
370,5.0,Aug 2018,"Shenzhen, China ",Outstanding Disneyland,It was a great blend of old and new Disneyland. It is also a very large Disneyland. I was there 10+ hours and still only got on half the rides I wanted to. The food choices were plenty and it was also a nice blend of west meets east. I chose a shrimp waffle sandwich that was interesting but tasty.As one would expect at a Disneyland be prepared for long lines and large crowds. Though the prices for everything even after the exchange rate made going to this Disneyland cheaper than the original in California.I would recommend the Tron and Pirates of the Caribbean rides...2 examples of the new technology Disneyland uses to update older rides.I would definitely go again. It was Disneyland Chinese style.
371,4.0,Sep 2018,"Jersey, UK ",Rockin' it solo!,"Put the pushing, shoving, screaming, running, burping, spitting, tantrums (both kids and adults) and the need to relieve oneself in public; then Disney Resort Shanghai is AWESOME!I spent a day and a half at the park (as stayed at a resort hotel, which I highly recommend) and had enough time and enjoyment.The highlights for me were the Tron rollercoaster and new PotC ride. Most attractions are new or have been tweaked (and even improved, Peter Pan being one) at the park, giving it a fresh feel. The castle for one is massive and holds some great themed architecture (if like me you like spotting hidden things and ""easter eggs"" then Shanghai doesn't disappoint). There are 7 themed lands to explore, all with rides, shops and eats. I would suggest shopping at all as they do hold different items. The amount of green space, gardens and chill out areas are a nice touch. Obviously we are in China so everything is very Chinese and shows, music etc are in Mandarin. However the English is very good, although some cast members do struggle, but they will find someone who can and are always happy to say hi or help.There are two shows (both in Mandarin) that are worth a watch, a day parade and firework show that is a good end to the day. Character greets are also throughout the day, queues for Mickey & Co. around the main street can get long so keep an eye on times or you can ask.I only eat at Remy's Patisserie for a sweet treat, but there are plenty of choices.You can also go to Disney Town, which has a massive World of Disney Store and a plethora of shops and eateries. I ate at the Dining Room (dim sum and noodles etc.) and the Crystal Jade (Cantonese style and pricier); both very nice food and good dumplings. My only issue is the wait staff were not that helpful, miserable and looked bored. There are Western options too,  but as in China why?The park is easy to get too from city centre, just use the MRT line 11 that takes you straight there or if arriving from airport a taxi will take around 25-45mins and cost around ¥100-120.It is a great addition to the Disneyland roster and a fun and new experience. I just warn be prepared for some crazy queues and antics!"
372,5.0,Aug 2018,"Austin, Texas ",Favorite Disneyland Yet,"I've visited WDW (Florida), DLR (California), Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland as of yet and this was my favorite so far.  Tron was an amazing ride and I actually love the fact that I could purchase Fastpasses to almost every ride available in the park.  The handful of rides we couldn't such as Jet Packs we rode first thing in the morning and we skipped the carrousel.  So even though the lines were long we really never experienced a wait and we were able to pay to ride Tron three times which was our favorite ride.  The water raft ride was the best raft ride I've ever been on and I enjoyed the Yeti animatronics and the Pirates of the Caribbean ride with it's new technology was amazing and so different from all the others I've ridden.  Even rides like Peter Pan have upgraded technology and are like brand new experiences.  There were so many new things here it was like visiting Disney for the first time with that initial rush of excitement you get.  I have visited the American parks so many times it's been awhile since I've had that type of Disney rush and while I visited Hong Kong Disneyland for the first time on this same trip it didn't provide the level of excitement as Shanghai.  The castle is the most beautiful of the castles I've seen and it has a cool walk thru that's also unique to this park. I also very much enjoyed the Tarzan show and the fireworks which we got reserved seating for by eating dinner at the restaurant in the castle (it was an extra cost).  I felt like the food here was better than Hong Kong but not as good as the food in the California which is my favorite so far.  Yes, it's true that people here crowd and push you more than other countries and I was shocked when I saw children using the bathroom in the middle of the sidewalk but still the beauty and expanse of the park, the ability to ride almost everything with a fastpass and the new technology still made this the most amazing experience.  I highly recommend going out of your way if you're a Disney fanatic like me and need a new experience."
373,4.0,Sep 2018,"Cape Town Central, South Africa ",Awesome experience.,"We haven't been to a Disney resort since 1998 In Orlando so can only recall a few details.  Shanghai Disney was a blast, which our 12 year old daughter absolutely loved. She went beserck the entire day. The park waa exceptionally clean and well maintaned and rides are top quality and all well managed. Even though there were waiting times for rides it didnt feel long and boring as they kept moving. That been said I do have a few negatives to mention.1. The food was atrocious. We had some Chinese stir fry dish which was simply disgusting.  The fish and chips that my daughter ate was no better.   We later tried a corn dog which was equally foul.  I would rather eat my shoe than this drivel. 2. Although incredibly friendly and helpful, very little staff spoke English which made obtaining info difficult.   Before you say well we were in China, I consider Disney to be an international park and some standards one expects.  Well me anyway.I highly recommend visiting this park whether local or tourist."

The rides were well run and the lines weren’t too long."
376,4.0,Sep 2018,N/A,A good day trip ,A good day out but a few things that this Disneyland could do to improve. Firstly getting there is very very easy on the metro and very cheap but make sure you get there early. There aren’t that many rides. Although their pirates of the Caribbean is a must do - It is very different than the other parks. We went on a Monday and although there were few kids there were lots and lots of people. The fast pass system required the app so if you’re travelling make sure you have data. You also can’t use more than one fast pass at a time so you’ll need to plan your day out around them. Food is expensive and average although was expected. The park also could have done better with advertising things like the parade. It’s on the app but no physical signs anywhere. Worth going but be prepared.
377,5.0,Jun 2018,"Jiangsu, China ",Must See,"I've never been to Disneyland before, so my trip to Shanghai Disneyland has been my only experience with any of the parks. If you have the opportunity to visit, I recommend it! I went during June, and it was very busy. I suggest you show up early to get into the park gates! There will be a LARGE crowd/line, and it will be an experience that most Western's are not used too. Once you make it through the line, things will get a lot less crowded until the firework show. Lines can be long, so get a fast pass if you can. There was usually an 120minute wait for the mine car ride and Tron. I'm hoping to visit again in the fall."
378,5.0,Jul 2018,"Edmonton, Canada, ",Plan your visit for the best experience!,"We love Disney Parks. I have been to Hong Kong, Orlando and Anaheim. Now cross this off the bucket list. Shanghai Disney Resort is newest one so they are more modern facilities, rides and design integrated into the park to give guests a more magical experience. We planned it carefully as to avoid as much crowds as we can given that it is school holidays in July and its China so there are bound to be lots of people. We went on a Monday but still its a lot of people in line at the restaurants, rides and other attractions. Disney always tries to ensure guests have a magical experience from entrance to exit. I see many elements of it here. There are typical China behavior from some guests that cannot be changed and its out of Disney's control, specifically line ups and seating at food courts. Overall, it was fabulous and make sure you take advantage of speed passes available. And buy your tickets online in advance. Foreigners should bring the passport the tickets were purchased under."
379,4.0,Jul 2018,"Haywards Heath, UK ",beautiful park but too busy ,"this is a beautiful and spacious park which even when busy feels calm. the queues however were horrendous, up to 3 hours, which limited our enjoyment. if you visit in school holiday time but your ticket online, had we not have done this we wouldn’t have got in. i would recommend going out of chinese school holidays if yo possibly can.  the subway station is very close and out round trip only cost about £1.50 and was about 40 minutes. food options were good, western and chinese and the park was very clean.

380,5.0,Sep 2018,"Ampang, Malaysia ",Huge and lots to do,"Shanghai Disney is our 2nd experience as a family. Compared to Hong Kong Disney, the rides and shows quantity are about the same with key differences in walking distance. The area of Shanghai Disney feels significantly larger than Hong Kong Disney. iPhone tracked that over 21,000 steps were done on both days. We rented a stroller for RMB90. If it was tiring for adults, there’s no way young children could last without one. Happy about the Fast Pass system which I only knew about here. Makes key attractions more accessible for everyone, but some serious walking is needed if we were to go for back to back Fast Passes. Since we were there for 2 days, we get to try out most of the rides on Day 1, and spent Day 2 focusing on shows. It was the right decision because it rained on Day 2. There are probably more efficient ways to enjoy Shanghai Disney but with young children, I think we managed pretty well with the time that we had. Also, the biggest delay would be the picture taking with Disney characters. If you can do without that, you can definitely cram in a few more rides. There was only a day parade at 3.30pm and no night parade like there was in Hong Kong Disney. Wish it had one.Otherwise, most of the rides, dialogues and narratives are in Mandarin Chinese. It made sense for Disney since 90% of the visitors are from China itself. Would like to come again some day!"

When we got there, they had us walk about ½ mile of course to go around a bunch of building to get in line to go through security. It took 70 minutes to get through security. The entire time, people had no conscience about personal space and they had no issues cutting in front of you if there was more than 6 inches between you and the person in front of you. After an hour of waiting after that, we finally made it to the line to get in. This was another hour or so wait until they opened up another gate and people started shoving and pushing. There were people on the ground screaming as people were walking and running over them. It seriously looked like one of those black Friday videos if Walmart was handing out free computers to the first 100 people. The people in line didn’t care and were shoving. I had to leave the line because it was too much, and went immediately to customer service and asked to speak to a manager. They talked to us, printed our tickets, and put us in some type of VIP line or something, as there were only like 15-20 people in front of us and we were finally able to get. This was an incredibly horrible horrible horrible way to start the day. Luckily this was the worst part of the day, and it got better, but just from that short experience it why I gave this park 2 stars compared to every other park. The workers there during the process of getting into the park did not care that people were getting stepped on or that there was no room to move or breathe. Talk about a fire hazard. By far one of the worst experiences I’ve ever had at any theme park. We came back the next day, and I chose to not come in at park opening, but rather an hour and a half after opening, hoping that it wasn’t the same thing again (we had bought 2 day tickets). Luckily the 2nd day wasn’t near as back and we got through security and the 2nd line in less than 30 minutes and were able to enjoy the rest of our visit. The next negative thing on my list was the crowd. The crowd was so big and the lines were ridiculous. All of the waits on any of the rides were 2 hours or more. Most rides back in the US are around an hour which is reasonable, but 2 hours for any ride put us only being able to ride a couple of the good rides each day. Knowing I would not be coming back here anytime soon, I opted to purchase the fast pass option for all the rides on the 2nd day. This gave us a fast pass for every ride that we could go on or take at any time during the day. We didn’t have to wait for a specific time, but could go anytime during the day. This was great (and expensive), but otherwise we would not have been able to ride all the rides during our short 2 day visit to Shanghai Disneyland. The 3rd dislike, which isn’t a huge deal, but want people to be aware, is that there are scalpers selling Disney related items, but not actually from Disney, both outside the park and inside the park (especially in the Alice in Wonderland Maze). It’s not a huge deal, but they are selling stuff in all the long lines trying to get people to buy knock off items. If you told them no, they didn’t really bother you, but the police and employees did try to remove them from the park multiple times that I saw. Now that the negative park of my review is over, let’s get on to the good part: the rides, the entertainment, the food ☺Rides – The rides were AMAZING! Must do list: TRON, Buzz Lightyear, Pirates of the Caribbean. TRON – I’m sure everyone had read a ton of reviews on this ride, and its true, it is a once of a kind ride. I am a bigger guy (5’10”, 2090#) I was able to fit on the ride with no issues, so those of you who are larger in size will have no issues riding this ride. I just wish it had a flip, that would have been even better, but going inside to outside and back inside was really cool. I am glad we got to ride this ride 3 times during our visit. If you can, try and ride it at night, it’s a completely different experience. Buzz Lightyear Planet Rescue – This one was a lot of fun, more fun than the one in the states. The pointers had lasers on them, so you could actually see where you were pointing, It was a lot easier to get to the higher scores above 1,000,000.  I still lost, but it was nice to be a level 7 – Galactic hero for once!Pirates of the Caribbean is unlike any other Pirates ride across the world. There are huge IMAX screen, fights that go over your boat, fire, smoke, explosions, everything. It was really cool and glad we got to do it a couple of times. EntertainmentMarvel Universe – This was a really cool place, and a hidden gym. We found this late on our last night there. It had all the versions of Iron Man’s suits, up to the 7th version. Here we got to meet Captain America, see the Hulk Buster, and take a ton of photos. It was really cool. Star Wars Launch Bay – This was another hidden gym. We got to take photos with R2D2, Darth Vader, and pilot the Millennium Falcon. Food – Food was overall good, They had a mix of Chinese food (which I wanted all the time while there), as well as American pizza, pretzels, churros, soft drinks, and other assorted foods. You will not go hungry here, I promise. Overall inside the park was great, but it was the experience getting in that made it such a bad day for us. I’d recommend buying fast passes, as they will run out of them by the time you get inside and the only way to ride anything with all those people is to pay extra for them."
383,5.0,Sep 2018,"Surabaya, Indonesia ","AWESOME PARK, FABULOUS TIME!","Contrary some of the review and image created for Shanghai Disneyland.We had an absolute blast of a time! I think we really did come in the low season, it was brilliant. Sure we had raining some time of the day, but you cannot blame Disney for that.Sure, the staff speaks barely any english but they go out of their way to make sure they help you out. Most of the Supervisor (Blue Shirt) speaks English and can help you out if you just ask nicely. Are things overpriced? maybe but it's Disney or it works the same for all the theme park around the world? isn't that expected. Let me address the common image, the park is clean, the toilet is CLEAN. I think they have a dedicated cleaner in every toilet/area. We have no issues of hygiene/rubbish in the park at all.The rides are excellent, we ride almost of all the ride. We didn't get to try the adventure and canoe because my daughter is still too young/short. Other than that we tried almost every single ride in all of the area. We met all kind of character left and right. We watched show for Tarzan (Amazing), Elsa (So-so), Pirates (Didn't make to the end, daughter scared of pirates), in general the queue  is manageable if you come in the right time, we went to early showing, barely anybody. I really thought that the new digital fast pass in your phone, works like magic. We had no trouble of getting fast pass, only thing we didn't do is Soaring, because Wife is afraid of being dizzy due to the big screen, we tried in in LA anyway. Pirates of Carribean is SPECTACULAR as well as Tron, those two are probably the best rides in the park in my opinion, no trouble at all. We got early entry because we stayed in the Toy Story Hotel, never once we had to queue in the main entrance. It's a worthwhile investment in my opinion.We had lunch at the royal banquet hall, the food is good, not great but good. The price you pay is very steep, but if your children loves to meet character it doesn't get better than this. The character would come out one by one to greet you in your table. They were all in Royal Costume. We met Micky, Minnie, Donald, Daisy and a mysterious guest , it was Princess Aurora. My daughter went to Bobbidi Bibbidi Boutique and got the Royal Treatment, included in the package is the dress up, make up as a princess; you can choose Cinderella, Belle, Aurora, Snow White, Tinker Bell, Rapunzel and one more. I personally thought snow white was the cutest, my daughter chose Belle, You get professional photoshoot on the chair and for the royal package they made you a story book. Bonus you get to meet another princess, we met Snow White and got a VIP entry for Frozen the show.Download the Disney Shanghai app and photo pass, photo pass is so functional you can get all the photos from Disney photographer into your phone. I think if you plan your timing right, you really could get most out of the park.I will definitely come back once they expand new area. As we have done most of the rides on this trip. We had such a good time as a family. Please do go, but prepare properly, find the right timing. Plan your days. Disney town also has plenty of food, all kind of cuisine and also some shopping, it has a huge lego shop. We had breakfast in the starbucks, fantastic pastries selection."
384,4.0,Apr 2018,"Leeds, UK ",Worth a visit but not in the holidays!,"Firstly I was quite surprised at how cheap it was to enter! we bought the tickets online prior to arriving in China and thought quite cheap, there were queues to get in but were moving. Didn't realise we had gone in the holidays so it was crazy busy and by the time we realised to get the queue jump app it was too late! We queued over 3 hours and only got on 2 rides! Overall worth a visit if you have the time lot cheaper than Europe and make sure you go on Tron!"
385,5.0,Sep 2018,"Holmfirth, UK ",Magical!,"I visited on a Monday and arrived as the park opened by subway from the city centre (very easy). I was able to go on all the rides I wanted, some multiple times and had very minimal waiting times. I took advantage of the fast pass on the app too - I recommend using it on the Tron ride, which was the most superior ride in the park. The whole day was completely magical and I can’t wait to return again soon! As expected many of the attractions are in Mandarin, but I think that only adds to the charm and wonder of the place. I have visited Disney in Orlando a couple of times and this park certainly matched my previous experiences. It was really fun trying Chinese Disney food too! Cannot recommend enough for kids of any age (I’m 25 haha!). "
386,4.0,Sep 2018,"Brunswick, Australia ",Sunday visit exceeded expectations,I almost didn’t go to shanghai Disneyland on my only avail day (sun 9th) after reading the reviews online. I went at 10am. Never waited more than 15 mins for any ride (straight onto TRON).Left at 3pm and crowds beginning to build then. There are fewer rides than the California version. Still a wonderful experience that I thoroughly enjoyed.
387,4.0,Sep 2018,"Quezon City, Philippines ",Always kids at heart,"Disneyland will always be Disneyland no matter where you go. The characters, the layout and even the food. The difference is the chinese language as the primary language being use within the park. It is very seldom you find someone who can speak english. This disneyland is located near the airport and far away from the city center. A good 45min to 1 hour drive. Downloading the app is a big help to go around the place and see in real time the waiting time and available rides for the day.Water more than 600ml is not allowed. The mickey mouse ice cream taste good. The rides are just OK, all shows are in chinese language. There will always be a language barrier but who are we to complain, it is the happiest place on earth."
388,3.0,Aug 2018,"Hong Kong, China ",China Disneyland,"We stayed in Toy Story Hotel, where we could enter the part from another entrance plus one fast pass.  There were long waiting line everywhere during summer holiday.  The fast pass worth it.  Less smiles on staff compare to HK or Tokyo Disneyland. Long operation hours compare to HK or Tokyo Disneyland.  People jumped the lines, you need to get used to the Chinese culture.Frozen sing along is in Putonghua."
389,4.0,Sep 2018,"Pitman, NJ ",We enjoyed Shanghai Disney," Sorry this review is long, but I think it’s comprehensive.  Ifeel bad writing this considering all the bad reviews, but we had a great time. Schools in China start September 1st so definitely make sure you go after that date. We went today September 11 (Tuesday). It was empty. We walked right up to the lines. We were able to get fast passes but never need to use them. Tron had no wait throughout the day. The only wait I saw was 15 min. Rode mine train several times 15 min wait, without fast passes. Soaring had a 30 min wait. The kids didn’t complain. We completed the entire park by 5:30.My advice 3 parts. Part 1-Have a game plan prior to going, and go during the week (Tuesday -Thursday ) not in summer and after Sept 1st. Part 2- they are strict regarding height regulation for entrance tickets. Where as Disney World would let your child get by as a child ticket if they were an inch or 2 above the line, Disney Shanghai will not. My daughter was 2 centimeters above the “child ticket” restriction and I had to buy her an adult ticket.  Save your self energy and time and just pay the few dollars. She literally grew 2 centimeters in the 2 months I had bought the ticket.Part 3- remember 1&2Compared to Disney World it is relatively small. We had a game plan from the beginning so that helped. I purchased my tickets on Kook or Klook I believe. It saved time I went directly through the turn-style. People brought snacks. I downloaded and set up the app prior to entering the park which made life easier. Once I got my tickets I immediately got a fast pass for soaring and walked over to Tron because it was towards the front of the park, then competed all the other rides. I found that the best time to go to the “more popular rides” was during parades. The 7 dwarves mine train had a 40 min wait but during the parade the wait was 10 min, allowing us to ride 2 times and still see parts of the parade.Only real complaint is the food. It sucked regarding choices. I food food to be extremely bland, over cooked. The fish sticks were green and the pizza was the worst. Wasn’t as badly overpriced as Disney Florida food though. They have a Cheesecake Factory, so we ate snacks during the day and ate there at night. People will try to cut the line and forget personal space. Don’t stress- we stood horizontally so no one could pass us. I put my hand on my hip towards my rear so if you got too close you would walk into my elbow. Think smarter not harder- don’t stress life’s too short. The staff were really nice to us and spoke a good amount of English. There was always another staff on call that could help out if there was any confusion. We have been traveling throughout China for 3 weeks with 3 kids and know only thank you and hi in Chinese with no translator and we have had a ball. "
390,1.0,Jul 2018,"Bergen, Norway ",I didn't want to enter,"...but with a 9 year daughter, that was not an option. It's no secret that Disney is a pretty greedy company, but for the most it's tolerable. This particular park however, is really bad. No problem with the rides of course, and it's nice and clean, but don't expect to go on more than one or two rides, unless you're willing to spend big. The most popular rides have THREE hours waiting time. But if you're willing to double what you paid for the entrance to the park, you'll get 6 of 7 VIP-passes. So if it hadn't broken my daughter's heart, Disney wouldn't see any of my money. We've visited several Disney parks, these are by far the worst lines I have ever seen. I'm reluctant to visit a Disney park ever again. "
391,4.0,Sep 2018,"Shanghai Region, China ",Toystory Hotel was the Best Part,Cons:1. Disney is huge. Too much walking2. Don’t go in a Shanghai Summer. You will regret it.3. If you are planning on going on rides leave children below 5. 5. If you are not accustomed to Local people’s behavior...run6. No sense of directions7. Fast Pass is useless8. The hotel food was very expensivePros:1. The characters and people in the park were very friendly2. Tron3. On a nice day Disneyland really looks like a fantasy world. 4. Tron5. The Toystory Hotel is very affordable 6. Did I say Tron.7. Disney Balloons are awesome8. The Toy Hotel was like a fantasy come true. The rooms were very clean9. Tron.
392,1.0,Sep 2018,N/A,DISNEYLAND SHANGHAI,"1. me and my family were told, cannot bring selfie stick. But we saw some people bring it inside the dianeyland. So its not fair because the security guard didnt check other properly2. Theres no halal food. And we cannot bring food fromOutside. Its not fair to muslim tourist. If they cannot bring food, and theres no halal food. What they gonna survive for one day ? I’ve been to HK and paris disneyland. Atleast they have fish and chips. But here , they only serve pork every places.3. Timing for firework show at night. They said they will starts at 8. But now almost 1/2 hours. And its raining, theres alot of kids. Theres have less bench. And they force us to sit on floor. As i said its raning. They should learn to be punctual. 4. Worker at disneyland, they dont speak or understand in english. What i know is Disneyland is for international people, i mean not just chinese people visit. There also indian,arabian,indonesia ,malay and other races. Its so hard to communicate with the workers, to buy things or food. The worst disneyland i ever go. As i sad, disneyland paris and Hk better than disneyland shanghai."
393,5.0,Sep 2018,singapore ,Give it a try,"I initially did not want to go due to the numerous bad review, but decided to pay a visit as it was my last Disney resorts not visited. I'm glad I did. When I was there, I did not experienced the negative aspects mentioned by a lot of reviewers. There was no queue cutting, and the park was clean. Average waiting time for rides were abt 20 mins. I went in to Pirates of the Caribbean 3 times without fuss, and Tron was abt 30 mins. All without fast pass. The service was also good. I dropped my Sunglasses in the Slinky Dog ride and they located it, helped me to courier it to my hotel all within a day.I think the key is to visit during off peak and the experience should be a lot better. I definitely like it better than Hong Kong Disney."
394,4.0,Aug 2018,"Singapore, Singapore ",One word: TRON!,"I visited in mid-August, unaware it's still school holidays but expected the huge crowds (I downloaded the Disney Resort app to see the wait time trends). Bit unfair that the theme park entrance charges twice for summer season (July-August), so I bought a 3PM pass ahead of time just to get a crack at the Shanghai Disney experience.The park is connected by Metro Line 11 (terminus station), which is what majority of the visitors take. From downtown it takes an hour, then there's a long path leading to either Disney Town (shops and restos outside the park, worth a look) or Disney Land itself. Still a lot of people coming in the afternoon, although I was able to enter the park without waiting. Not much security check so my water bottle and a bit of snacks went unscathed.Goes without saying the park is huge! Upfront is Mickey Avenue with cutesy shops, but I felt the ones in Japan & Hong Kong were nicer. Made a dash to Treasure Cove where the Pirates of the Carribean ride was in (I didn't bother with Soaring and Rapids because they took 2-3hours wait at most), but what was 40min min wait turned into an hour - seemed the single rider line was none the better. I was looking forward to what the reviews here were raving about, but I felt underwhelmed by the ride. I moved onto Peter Pan's Flight after (20-min queue), which I liked better because of the storytelling and (maybe because it had 2-seater 'ships', and nostalgia?)I went to see the large pink castle (which I usually just view from a distance in other Disneylands) and did Once Upon A Time (more of a gallery), featuring an animated and singing Snow White. (Not really recommended, but go when you want a respite from the heat as there's a/c in the castle of course :))I ran to Tomorrowland and queued up for TRON - it was a 75min wait but I was hyped for this the most. My first experience was AWESOME! It made up for all the sweating (very humid day), queuing (you know how everyone just wants to get ahead), and hunger (good think I packed sandwiches). You were perched on what looked like motorcycles (like in Tron) and roll down the coaster soaring indoors (great effects) and outdoors (exhilarating)! Much better if you sat on the left side for the reaction shot you'll see on your way out. As you can see I dedicated an entire paragraph to Tron -- so go do it! Even better tip: I rode several times more toward closing time - no queues, ma!"
395,3.0,Sep 2018,"Singapore, Singapore ",Shanghai Disneyland Sept 2018,"Special paid a visit to see what was new in this resort coming down 2years anniversary.But a bit disappointed willlook like no any special highlighted dedicated to Shanghai Resort as compared to others. Definitely bigger than HK Disneyland.Nevertheless, their Disney Town definitely brought my attention especially all the foods within that area. If you happen to be there, must pay a visit just besides the resort."
396,3.0,Aug 2018,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ",The only Non-Magical Disneyland in the world,"We have been to most of the Disneyland around the world (Except the Florida one). In the moment you step in the Disneyland of Shanghai, we don’t really feel that “magical”. Most probably because of the crowd and the attitude of the staff there. We visited the site on Friday (Weekday).We visited Shanghai Disneyland is just to cross our goal on our world Disneyland visit list. Is not bad but is not that great too. Anyway, the Must do is “Pirate of the Caribbean” ride (Queing time (min) 60-90 minutes) and also the “Tarzan” show. The “Tarzan” show is entertaining as basically is the aerobic performance incorporated in the story. Is ok that you don’t understand Chinese, because the performance itself is amazing. The popular ride that suitable for small kids (5 yo and below) of Winnie The Pooh & Peter Pan Ride average waiting time is 60 minutes. The Rex Racer is fun too (similar with Japan Toy Story ride, but simplified version). The average waiting time is 20-40 minutes. Must download the apps, the apps waiting time is updated accurately. If you are staying at the Disneyland Hotel or Toy Story Hotel, you are allowed to get one free fast pass. But limit to few rides only (like Winnie the Pooh, Seven Dwaft, Rex Racer, Peter Pen, etc). So I would like to suggest you to get this fast pass then once you step in Disneyland, quickly get another fast pass by using the apps. So at least you can have 2 fast pass on hand. By the time we finish the park fast pass, you are only allow to take second fast pass as any Disneyland in the world. But you will have no chance to get second fast pass as it already fully redeemed. As summary means, 1 hotel fastpass set at 10:30-11:00 am, get Park fastpass, which hopefully u can get as early as possible. After confirm getting this 2 fast pass, you can go and queue up for Pirates of the Caribbean. As this ride not offer any fast pass. Anyway, the good news is.....and only happened in Shanghai...if you have money, basically you can buy all the fast past rides. (RMB 150 per person per ride)! That’s the only park in the world that allow you to buy fast passes!!! Oh ya...The experience at Royal Banquet Restaurant is also good. But you need to call and pre-book first. You can do it before your arrival.Let me know, if you guys has any other question. "
397,5.0,Mar 2018,"Leshan, China, ",One day visit is not Enough,"The Park is huge,  one day visit is not enough, you need to stay in there at least 3 days to see everything, The rides and attractions are very good,  the Chinese population is huge, so the park is way too crowded, I and my daughter we both enjoyed our visit."

399,4.0,Jan 2018,"Mexico City, Mexico ",Magic Experience,"Magic is what Disneyland sells, and in this case it wasn’t the exception, I visited the park on a rainy day and let me tell you it’s one of the best options to avoid crowded places... all attractions were open and had a line about 5/15 minutes, it was well worth to be dripping wet to avoid the crowds ! The Tron experience is truly beautiful, it transports you to a future era that isn’t outdated as in other Disneyland’s “futuristic” themes."
400,2.0,Aug 2018,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates ",Not a good Disney experience,"As a huge Disney fan I was keen to visit another park in a new city, but I was very disappointed.  Yes it was August, and yes it was very hot, but it took 1hr to get in to the park at 8am, all the Fastpasses were gone by 9am, with the popular attractions already having waittimes of 150 minutes and up, and guests pushed and shoved in lines for attractions, making queuing even more unpleasant and fustrating.  Whilst they offer 'Single Rider' for a couple of attractions, this had the same wait time as the regular queue.  Taking pictures was probably the most enjoyable part of my day!  I imagine this park would be more enjoyable on a slow day outside of summer, but for me it was a total letdown."
401,2.0,Aug 2018,N/A,They shut the door at midday,"I don't even know where to start! We bought 2 day tickets, the first day we went there around 11am, it was long que for bag checking so we decided to go in afternoon on 2nd day to avoid the que. Soon we found out that they actually shut the door at midday then reopen it at 3pm! So another long que again just to get in! I never know any other Disney land or Disney world does that! In the very hot day this is just ridiculous!Once you get in, all the fast pass will be gone doesn't matter what time you get there, unless you pay extra money for them, not Disney standard! The visitors are so many and so rude, they were trying to cut the line or pushing in all the time, I was argue with people who try to cut the line pretty much every single ride we were queuing.And queuing time is just forever! Small ride such as flying dumbo is around 1hour and bigger ride like Tron took 2 to 3 hours,  Soaring over the horizon took 5 hours! It was a big disappointment, the Disney magic seems disappeared at this place, I was hot, annoyed, angry and rushed to go on the rides. After 2 days been there we only made 6 to 7 rides. I would not go back there ever again, it's not for family with young child, only good thing about this Disneyland is the Tron ride. "
402,1.0,Aug 2018,N/A,Disney only for chinese,"Anything about China shall be studied and deeply analised before start. China has 1.4 billion people, most of them are humble people and very friendly, however when you decide to visit the same place as ""rich"" chinese people go, slow down and think twice. Those kind of chinese are unpolite, rude and xenophobic, tempt to short-cut the queue and threats you saying you are in China.Crowds in China is REALLY crowd and most of times it is worthy do skip the plan."
403,3.0,Aug 2018,N/A,It was my first Disneyland visit ,"To be honest I enjoyed my visit even when I just went for 3 rides we had a good time taking pictures. Lines are long we waited 1 and a half hour for just one ride. I suggest that they use technology for waiting list instead of typical waiting lines it was so uncomfortable, hot and hard to breathe, also the most annoying thing is that people cross the line and bypass you seems no one cares. Hope they include technology for waiting list it’ll make it easier for a person to just queues on an app then be notified that their turn is near. We are on the technology era why don’t they advantage form it!"
404,4.0,Apr 2018,"Toronto, Canada ",New Disney and a Great Start,"Shanghai Disney is huge. This is not a quaint Disney. It is grand and imposing, paths are huge and rides far apart. There is plenty of room for this park to grow, but its initial line up of ride is pretty good. With a blank slate this park is very beautiful and has some good takes on traditional lands. Pirate cove and adventure land are stand outs. And tomorrow land actually looks futuristic. Many of the rides are updated clones of similar Disney rides, but there are also new rides and rides that are completely different. Standouts include pirates, Tron and the challenge trails. Food was generally ok with a lot of quick service options. Lines weren’t bad if you planned carefully. We were there during a weekday and not during any holidays. Fast passes go quick but can be obtained electronically through the parks app on the wifi (which could be temperamental). Also, we found around lunch, dinner and during parades lines really cleared out for certain attractions. Also, using the secondary entrance for hotel guests helped tick off several rides in the morning. We rode buzz and Tron within the first 20 minutes with no wait. The night show was only ok and people were just clamouring to get better views and holding up phones. Overall while guest behaviour could be different than North America, most were extremely nice and friendly. If you are in Shanghai and love Disney this is a different and fun experience."
405,5.0,Aug 2018,"Melbourne, Australia ",Amazing and newest Disneyland,"Shanghai Disneyland was my final Disneyland in the set ( I have been to them all) you can tell this is the newest of the Disneyland’s as everything is new, my favourite ride by far was the Pirates of the Caribbean ride which is unlike any of the other Pirates rides, I went on it four times without a fast pass I used the single rider line. The soaring ride is also amazing. Lots of different foods available but they don’t cater for Vegetarians in the Park. The bakery was  yummy to stock up on donuts, sandwiches etc. be prepared for it to be super hot if you go in August. I got a 2 day pass online which I thought was enough time to see everything and I stayed at the Toy Story Hotel. Disneytown has some great shops and restaurants including a big LEGO store. I was blown away by the size of Cinderella’s castle. "
406,4.0,Jul 2018,"Guaynabo, Puerto Rico ",Good experience,"Had a good day at Disney Shanghai.  As expected, they tailor some attractions and of course the food to the local area.  This is good, as I wanted to experience Disney with a twist.  Prices are standard Disney prices. Recommended if you have the time while in Shanghai.  If you are in a tight schedule you are better with local stuff only."
407,1.0,Aug 2018,"Limassol City, Cyprus ","Long queues, fastpass availability, and rides: ALL TERRIBLE","The worst Disneyland experience ever. We wasted our money and only managed to go on one adventure, after waiting for 3 hours in the queue. There is no fast pass availability. No thrill rides (apart from TRON and you need to wait for 2+ hours). There is no management in this park. Do not waste your money going there. There are thousands of people and you won't have fun at all. Even the shows are not that great. And its damn expensive, even a cheap umbrella costs 20 EUROS!We had a better time wandering around the Disney shops in Mickey Aveney and Town and also the restaurants outside the part and the Disney World store."
408,5.0,Nov 2017,"Brisbane, Australia ",Newest Disneyland,The Shanghai Disney is the newest one. Went on a wet day which meant less people but a few attractions were closed.

Definately better to come at a different season it is too hot and humid even in the evening. Ignite the dream show too crowded not sure where one would get the best view. People sit there 2 hours in advance to save a spot and that is not for me. Must be some tricks as to where to view it from. My daughter couldnt see anything so i had to carry her but still had limited view. All in all great atmosphere and vibe just prepare for chinese cutting in the lines. Hold on to the banisters to prevent them bypassing you.
410,1.0,Aug 2018,"Limassol City, Cyprus ",Bad experience ,Even though rides are good (we made it to 3 all day) experience is overall bad. Log lines . Fast pass to complicated and not easily accessible to non Chinese people. Information kiosks said that we need to buy the fast pass even though on the leaflet sais its free. Much more expensive than other Disney parks I visited
411,5.0,Dec 2017,N/A,"Worth of going, they have some good rides","1, One day probably is not enough, as usually they're lots of people in the Disneyland and you have to wait for long hours for each exciting rides.2, Of course try to get Fast Track whenever you can like any other Disneyland.3,Pack some snacks and water before you enter the park, the food and drinks prices are very high compare to the ones outside of the park.4, The parade is really good, much better then Tokyo's. It combined international and Chinese Disney cartoon figures like Mickey Mouse and Mulan. Very nice to see.5, They royal Caribbean ride is way better then Tokyo. I would highly recommend Disney Shanghai, not Tokyo!!!"
412,1.0,Jul 2018,N/A,"The people, weather, lines, fastpass availability, and rides WERE ALL TERRIBLE.","Absolutely the worst Disneyland experience ever! I would never recommend anyone to come to Shanghai Disneyland. It is a total waste of money. There is no comparison to the one in Anaheim. First of all, there are way too many people at this park. Too many people is the recipe for long lines and no more fast passes available for the whole day. Also, the people are very rude. Not the workers, but the park visitors. While waiting in line, we've experienced heavy pushing and cutting. And they don't speak a word of english! They have no social awareness at all. The whole time, they were up against my butt. And if I didn't move, they would try to cut me. They were getting on my last nerve. Also, the park has a limited amount of rides. No space mtn, no thunder mtn, no splash mtn, no small world, no matterhorn, no haunted mansion. Nothing. And i'd say there are only two rides that are actually good. Tron and Pirates. But right when the park opens, prepare to be waiting and hour or more for the stupidest rides ever (like Winnie the Pooh). I guess the Chinese people there don't enjoy thrill rides at all. Absolutely terrible experience and would not recommend to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

But, we just drank a lot of water and may have gone on Pirates more than once because it had amazing A/C:) The park was really clean and I liked that they had both Eastern and Western Toilets.

415,4.0,Jul 2018,"South Tangerang, Indonesia ","Hot, Crowded Park.","The weather was really hot. You should bring your hat, umbrella and sunblock. Since I went there with kids we were allowed to bring snacks, fruits such as banana or apple and water bottle. There was no queue for the locals I guess...they just cut the line through the exit line. So we should be guarded our line all the time especially if we were with kids. For me...tiring and but the kids were having fun. Won't go there if I visit Shanghai again and not on school holiday. Too crowded and extremely hot."
416,5.0,Apr 2018,"Hyderabad, India ",Absolute fun place but far too crowded!!,Reaching Disney Shanghai was quiet a job from our hotel which was located around 5 Kms from the Nanjing East walking Street. It took us around 1.45 hours to reach and it was already 11.45 a.m. It's adviced to reach as soon as possible in the morning hours. We went in the month of April and it was super crowded. Ques in all the attractions were so so long and the priority pass was not applicable in that period. We had to buy the costly Fast Passes for each one of us. It costed us too much but there seemed to be no option than buying it otherwise the few attractions which we were able to cover on that day wouldn't even be half if we hadn't bought it. No doubt it's an amazing place but so much of crowd makes it a bit difficult to enjoy it completely. Management should take some steps to improve that condition. Cleanliness was taken care of very well. Every inch was built with perfection and it felt very good to be there. It was a beautiful place. Otherwise it's a five star *****.
417,4.0,Jul 2018,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh ",Disneyland of Shanghai ,"It was almost alright, but the planning of the area needs to be re-thinking as we been there it was 40C temperature, which is common in July-August but you need to walk very long area on the sun without much shadow/trees and it seemed to me very far from everywhere to anywhere! Construction still ongoing, hope they can manage to take some measures. Rides are good but ... hope, would be there again during Autumn/Winter."
418,5.0,Dec 2017,"Mineola, NY ",Go in December - so worth it!,"Many of the other reviews about Shanghai Disneyland complain about the long lines and waits.  My group went to the park in mid-December, and while the temperatures were moderately cold (40-45 degrees most of the day), we were able to get on every ride we wanted, riding some 2 or 3 times, as desired.  We had a beautiful view of the fireworks that night and enjoyed a terrific day at the park."
419,5.0,Oct 2017,"San Diego, CA ",CROWDED but so worth it,"If you've NEVER traveled to Asia before, the 1st thing you need to be prepared for is extreme over crowding (everywhere) and of course ridiculously long waiting times.  I recommend going in the fall.  The weather is amazing & there seems to be far less crowds.  Now - for my review of the actual park.  SPECTACULAR!  The Pirates of the Caribbean ride alone is worth it.  The Tron ride is pretty cool too.  I hope the one they're bringing to the states is the same thing.  Remember - their culture is VERY different from that in the states.  There are people there selling knock off items INSIDE the park; they do not mind cutting you off while you're walking, talking or waiting in line.  I seriously can't stress that enough!  Be ready for that and you'll have an amazing adventure."
420,1.0,Aug 2018,"Phoenix, AZ ",Terrible management,No happiest place on earth feeling.  Instead everything is a waiting game and a money grab.  Pay more for fast passes for what limited rides they have.  Long lines await every ride simply but the policy that park hotel guests can get in sooner like all the others.  Tron ride was really short for the almost 3 hr wait.  Food prices raised for foreigners i watched it happened and then had to haggle to get a decent price when it was our turn.
421,1.0,Jul 2018,"Belfast, UK ",A day we will never get back!,"We spent 1 day in Disney Shanghai in July this year. They cannot be blamed for the heat! But they can be blamed for horrific waiting times on ALL rides (2-2.40hrs) and there were not big crowds in this park. We have only been to Disney Paris (a few times!) which has always had bigger crowds than Shanghai,and we were really looking forward to Shanghai once we decided to go. Yes you can buy fast passes, but why should you? You have already spent a lot on a ticket. And yes, you can get them on the app if you are lucky, you might get one ! But I truly feel the fault here is not enough rides, as the few they have of course everyone (even though there are not big crowds in the park) is queuing for them, and being China, everyone is trying to get ahead!  The staff are not overly helpful, and the (food/drink) stalls seem to close early. I have to say, I did read some reviews before we went, downloaded the app, and thought we would still enjoy it, and read others when we got back to our hotel that night which I now believe they were paid to do them! If I lived in Shanghai, I think I would go to Hong Kong to do Disney, because I certainly would not go back there. Disney ought to be ashamed to put there name to this park."
422,4.0,Jul 2018,"Honolulu, HI ",Purchasing Premier Access is a MUST,"Suggestions1 Download Shanghai Disneyland App and purchase tickets on your phone before you get to the park.  This way you can go directly to the turnstiles and avoid the ticket purchasing line.2 Arrive Early to the Park. The walk from the metro/taxi drop off area is quite far from the park entrance, around 15 to 20 minutes walk.  We went in July and got to the park entrance around 30 minutes before opening and it was so crowded (and hot) already.3 Shanghai Disneyland is the only Disneyland where you can actually purchase fast passes.  Once you enter the park, purchase one of the 3 Premier Access Packages Shanghai Disneyland offers, on your phone. We purchased the ""Adventure"" set which included Tron, Pirates of the Caribbean, Buzz Lightyear, Roaring Rapids, and Seven Dwarfs Mine Train. It cost 420 Yuan extra.  The only good ride missing from this set is Soaring. You can also purchase fast passes for each individual ride but you get a slight discount purchasing them in a set.  If there's more than 1 of you, you will need to create a party on your app, and link the individual tickets to the premier access passes you purchased.  4 Even if you have purchased one of the Premier Access plans, you can still get fast passes with your ""regular"" entry ticket.  You can get them on your phone using the Disney app (no need to stand in line), and we were able to get one for Tron.  That's the only fast pass we could get all day with our ""regular"" ticket. The standby lines at Shanghai Disneyland are crazy long, especially in the unbelievable heat of July. Not kidding, but the standby line for Soaring, at 8:13 am was already 180 minutes long! Guests from the Disney hotels are allowed early entry into the park, so I'm assuming that's where the problem for ""normal"" customers starts.5 Be aware, there's no Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, Haunted Mansion, or It's a Small World.6 This was the 6th and final Disneyland for my family.  It's our least favorite Disney but it's still worth coming to inspite of the heat and crowds as long as you purchase one of the Premier Access Plans. My favorite ride was Pirates and it's unlike any of the other Pirate rides around the world.  You feel like you're inside the movie. Tron was also good but it's short and I didn't enjoy it as much as some other people have.7 Hope this helps with your visit to Shanghai Disneyland."
423,5.0,Dec 2017,"Jakarta, Indonesia ",not too old for disney,"this is newest disneyland. come to shanghai and enjoy the new one. is very big. the famous attraction are TRON and PIRATES OF CARIBBEAN (only in shanghai, can not find in other disneyland). i visit shanghai disneyland in winter, for you who plans visit theme park in winter season, pls dont forger to bring your winter coat, because will be very cool in the night. at 8pm we can enjoy the beautiful fireworks which every disneyland got. hope to see you again shanghai disneyland!"
424,4.0,Jul 2018,N/A,Magical Experience,"We had limited time due to flight delays to visit Shanghai Disneyland but loved every minute! The TRON ride is a must do, fast and fun! Like riding on a motorcycle at high speed in the sky! The Pirates of the Caribbean is also a must do, much better than Disneyworld or Disneyland versions, giant Imax size video screen effects make you feel like you are on the Black Pearl with Jack and his crew! Love the Buzz Lightyear too, much easier to see your laser and improved target and graphics! We ran out of time for the rest of the park rides but plan to go back. We also bought the Adventure Premium package to avoid the long lines since we had limited time and it was worth every RMB! The castle was huge and even though they were trying to pay tribute to every princess it seemed over the top. The finale/fireworks show was a let down compared to WDW/Paris parks, very few fireworks and it was so crowded, people were very aggressive regardless of how long you had staked out your spot! I would say skip it and ride instead while others are jockeying for space! Easy and cheap subway ride to the park! Some areas of the park closed early right before the fireworks start time, 8pm or so...especially food vendors around the park! We will go back some day and hopefully do Hong Kong as well! For the Disney fan it is a must see!"
425,1.0,Jul 2018,"Barossa Valley, Australia ",Nothing magical about this Disneyland,"Do not waste your time or money going to this Disneyland. I traveled with my two children 9 and 10 bought two child tickets, whet to enter Disneyland and was told because my daughter was over 130cm she would have to purchase an Adult ticket. WTF! we even had our passports to prove she was 10. Don’t sell child tickets if the height is what determines the ticket, simple. Each ride was approximately 2.5hr line up, there were no Disney characters walking around, the park was dull and boring. Two of the best rides were not open. I can’t believe we spent so much money for nothing. Hong Kong Disneyland is where you should go. Guest Services didn’t care either."
426,3.0,Jul 2018,"Adelaide, Australia ",Disneyland during summer school holidays.,The park is very small and only has 3 top tier rides. TRON the motorcycle roller coaster is excellent. A 2 hour wait for a 2 minute thrill ride. Soaring over the Horizon was also excellent. A 3 hour wait for a 5 minute simulator ride. Pirates of the Caribbean has advanced technology and is good too. Had a 90 minute wait. Long queues all day for everything. Distressed children galore. Got there early and waited an hour to get in anyway. Entrance is too small. I wondered if Disney had a policy about overcrowding.Food was good quality and reasonably priced. Getting there is 6 yuan on the metro from central Shanghai ie People’s Square. Metro took around 35 minutes. Spent 12 hours there and had 4 rides. The App works well but the promises of free fast passes after you arrive was not offered on the day. We went on a Monday and have noticed it is better on a Wednesday. Avoid school holidays and weekends is the take home message.It was still a good day. The park was relatively clean and queuing was respected by the locals the vast majority of times. The locals accepted the lengthy delays. Not so sure westerners would back at Anaheim.
427,1.0,Jul 2018,Guangzhou ,Mickey makes a run for the money.,"I survived Shanghai Disneyland...but only just!. We witnesed a violent fight, and experienced massive queues, vast crowds, unbearable heat, and the closure of all open rides during a relatively minor rain storm...and that was just on day one!.We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel for three nights. Not exactly a bargain at 14100 yuan for a relatively small room on the Kingdom Club floor but we did have a good view of the lake and I've no specific complaints other than it being vastly overpriced. Ken, the Head of the Kingdom Club was great, very welcoming and conducted my check in with a huge amount of information (too much verbal with little written) and some badges for the kids. When he was around things ran relatively smoothly but when he wasn't, the Club was mean with drinks, mean with hospitality and an unwelcoming place to be. Ken was kind enough to lend us binoculars to see the fireworks and even opened the balcony (normally closed for safety reasons apparently for us to see from outside).We'd booked a tour for the next day. Now the tour is the only way to do Disneyland as you get to avoid the queues (or should do) and get priority everywhere. This cost me 900 Euros in Disneyland Paris, 3750 HKD in Disneyland Hong Kong, but a whopping and insane 18,000 RMB in Shanghai. The meet with the Disney guide was confusing and the tour, compared to others, poor, with occassional queueing still required. We didn't get to see any shows or the parade from the VIP vantage points that come with the tour ticket as the time it took to complete our ride schedule consumed the available hours. The VIP area to view the nightly fireworks and light show was a poor second to the area they sell tickets for ...as they make extra revenue from that.However our second rate tour was nothing compared to the suffering those on normal tickets had to deal with. Two hour queues for a five minute ride, in 37 degrees C and 95% humidity with no facilities to keep people, particularly with children, cool is simply cruel. The Chinese have an amazing capacity to endure hardship without complaint but even this was tested to the extreme. We saw a violent fight break out, we saw tempers frayed and we saw ride staff being curt and unfriendly as their own patience and tolerance wore thin under intolerable conditions.Generally a major part of the Disneyland experience is all about the welcoming and engaging staff. Not only is this absent here but generally the staff are as well. Aside from the staff manning rides or at the organised events you rarely saw a staff member available for general help or guidance or simply to wish you a great day. There was plenty of Security around but they were not interested in engaging with customers only involved in quelling disturbances or checking tickets, bags and acting in an overbearing manner.The second day I'd booked the premier fast pass option (another 3750 RMB). We subsequently found out that it was only for access to certain rides and that a separate pass had to be collected at one specific office that happened to be far away from where we were in the park. With Disneyland making use of apps and QR codes the technology is available and very simple to make this customer friendly....but they haven't. We had to walk across the entire park to have our photos taken for a second time, and extra passes issued just to take advantage of what we'd paid for. Even then, the fast pass queues often filter into the main queue prior to the ride, leading to understandable resentment and occassional; queue barging from those poor soles who have been standing in line for 90 minutes in sweltering conditions.The Premier access pass came with the special VIP area for the evening light show. They'd clearly sold so many of the VIP viewing tickets that the relatively small area was completely filled with people to the point that my children couldn't see anything and couldn't cope with the heat generated within the packed compound.We left Disneyland Shanghai considerably poorer (around 40,000 RMB = US$5,800) having spent our two full days in the park with very little enjoyment to be had from it. The catchphrase at Shanghai Disneyland seems to be 'Have a Magical Day'.....anything less magical than this experience I cannot imagine....honestly it was horrible.You get the feeling that this is all about the money. It seems sheer greed to pack so many people into such small spaces in searing heat without offering any respite. It effects the staff as much as the clients and no-one seemed to be enjoying the experience. I'm sure the accountants are loving it and Mickey is having magical days looking at his bank account.......but Disneyland Shanghai you are ruining the Disney experience for your customers."

430,1.0,Jul 2018,N/A,Overcrowded and totally disappointed,"Thousands and thousands of people; crowds everywhere. You need to queue up to have your bag checked, to get the tickets printed, to experience any ride, to eat or get a drink. Average waiting time for any attraction or a ride is 60 - 90 minutes (!) which is absurd. I paid 1005 yuan (150 USD)  for 2 tickets (adult and child) and I was able to get a canoe ride for 10 min (after 1 hour waiting in a long line) and a 1.5 min train ride (also after waiting for an hour in a line). I left after 3 hours inside, as me and my daughter have had enough of waiting in crowded places.I was completely disappointed and felt like I was robbed. The place should limit the number of visitor to some 20% of what it is now, then it would probably be nice to visit this park."
431,5.0,Mar 2018,"Saint Louis, MO ",GREAT DISNEY EXPERIENCE - STAY AT THE HOTEL AND TAKE THE FERRY,"This was my final Disney property to visit.  I've been to all the others: LA, Orlando (all of them), Paris, Hong Kong, and Tokyo (both of them).  I really enjoyed the whole experience.  Pirates of the Caribbean is definitely the best of all Disney park rides in the world!  Just wish they had headsets for alternate languages, but the visuals need little dialogue.  You really have to see it to believe it.  I arrived at early opening entrance and headed directly across the center of the park to Pirates.  I was the first in line and had to wait before it actually opened.  The park didn't really start filling up for a couple of hours so it was easy to get on other rides.  It was on a Sunday.The Shanghai Disneyland Hotel was a little less expensive than all the other Disney properties but the quality was top notch.  During the fireworks show at the castle in the park, you can go to the top floor of the hotel which is has an open view to the fireworks and they play the same soundtrack being used in the park.  So, I got a preview of the show the night before I went in.  A really kind staff member at the hotel saw me standing and looking over at the park, he got out his smartphone and used a translator app to tell me in English about the view and sound at the top.  Really great service!"
432,4.0,Jul 2018,N/A,"If you just expect cultural differences and prepare, this park is amazing","My new husband and I went to Shanghai Disneyland as part of our honeymoon. Fortunately, I read up on the park beforehand and read a lot of reviews so I had a good idea of what it would be like. Here's what we did to make the trip fun and worth it:1. We went in with the expectation that people would try to skip lines (we had just done a cruise around Japan with a ton of Chinese tourists so we had gotten very good at this fortunately). I suggest holding hands and leaning back against the railings behind you to form a ""clothesline."" A lot of times, children would try to sneak past us (with their parents' seeming encouragement), but this method, along with a glare, stopped them. 2. We only had one experience with tourists being really pushy behind us (like literally a whole family jostling to try to get around us), and the Disney workers chided them immediately and told them that we were first in line. The workers have definitely been taught to enforce lines though, so use them as your allies! We were extremely polite to all of them and they were super helpful. Our experience was that there was at least one person in each ride or major location that spoke english. At the hotels, pretty much everybody spoke english, to varying degrees of skill.3. This is an extremely crowded park with high competition for even little rides from early on in the day. If you want to ride the good rides, I highly suggest you stay at a Disney hotel and get there a bit BEFORE the park opens for early opening at 7 am, as the line forms through disneytown early and people are competitive. We stayed at both the Shanghai Disneyland Hotel and the Toy Story Hotel and they were both really wonderful. The Shanghai Disneyland hotel in particular had MAGICAL FAIRY LIGHTS in the beds that lit up when you pressed a button by the bed - outlining tinkerbell and the castle! It was AMAZING. We did have sort of a stampede of Chinese visitors running toward us and skipping the line in this situation once; I mean, there wasn't really anything we could do about that.We bought the cheapest fastpass pack one day and used that to go through a lot of the rides, and then just used early entry and strategic app watching to deal the rest of the trip. There were still several rides we never got to go on, but those were all ones  of a type that you basically could find at every theme park, like the carousel or the slinky dog coaster.4. For the most part, we ate our meals in Disneytown (I can't find the names, but there was a ramen restaurant and a japanese restaurant that were both really good that sat literally right next to each other). However, we ate one meal at the castle at the royal banquet hall! We managed to just get reservations that morning just by asking politely if there were any available. The food quality was VERY good and we really enjoyed it. SO MANY MICKEY SHAPED THINGS. Be adventurous with your food; there was a mickey shaped aspic that was insanely delicious and totally different than anything I'd had before.We also ate at Aurora at Shanghai Disneyland Hotel, this park's fine dining establishment and equivalent of Victoria and Albert's. We secured reservations through the concierge. The food and drinks here were delicious and it was a bit cheaper than the same type of experience would have been in the states. Warning though, the Chinese version of fine dining is a bit disconcerting as first, as the waiters hover very close by and basically stare at you the whole time. I had like, four people give me directions to the bathroom (I only asked one) and the same four greeted me on my way back with a ""welcome back!"" I also had gazpacho made with liquid nitrogen though, and we had a table overlooking the castle so I'm not going to complain too much. There were a few Chinese families who dined at the same time who totally weren't in dress code and had their children running about the dining room, but honestly, we just decided to laugh about it and take it in stride, and it didn't affect our experience at all. Try the non-typical snacks in the park! Tater tots with pork floss on them (YUM), cherry popcorn - there is some FANTASTIC stuff. Remy's bakery has such amazing breakfast food. I basically tried a different thing every day. I highly suggest the mike wazowski bun, as it was hilarious and delicious. The bakery itself is a gorgeous homage to Ratatouille and I was extremely pleased with it. Honestly, all the restaurant theming was great - the Bacchus bar and the ballet cafe in Shanghai Disneyland Hotel were both wonderfully done tributes to Fantasia.5. As for the park itself, it is GORGEOUS and very well done, if not /totally/ up to the ""let's hide all the outlets"" disney world standard. They could do a bit better with cleaning up trash on the ground and in the lines, as well. But there were many amazing rides and experiences that you definitely wouldn't be able to find anywhere else. The Tarzan show was JAW DROPPINGLY AMAZING, like cirque de soleil on steroids. It basically was the best show I've ever seen in my life, anywhere; they did all the stunts you see in cirque de soleil shows, only all of them, in 30 minutes, several times a day, set to a story and with brilliant peter gabriel songs sung in chinese in the background. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride was my favorite; even though we didn't understand the Chinese dialogue, we got the gist, and the effects were out of this world. The challenge course was also one of our favorite things, and it's definitely the type of thing you'd never see in the states (they didn't even make us sign liability waivers hahaha, but we really enjoyed it - and it was our experience that it didn't take us nearly as long to get through the line as the counter claimed). The Tron ride is also very good, but I have neck problems, and personally found it a bit painful. Roaring rapids is extremely entertaining and a great option for right around lunch, when it's super hot and humid. The Pirates of the Caribbean stunt show is very very good; like there was a point where there were people fighting in mid air while going up and down on an air stream. The pirate ship area is super fun, lots of areas to explore on that. There are a couple hidden puzzles on that ship, be sure to look out for them. There are also a ton of English puns and jokes in the pirate area that we thoroughly enjoyed. Oh, and the Alice in Wonderland maze is super beautiful and surreal and lovely. The parades and fireworks shows are both very good, but pretty much everyone insists on watching them, so it's a good time to move about the park quickly and go to rides and shows; the lines don't move down THAT much, but any little bit counts when the lines are as long as they get at this park!Final Tips. Don't drink the tap water, just buy bottled (I've heard they have a really good water filtering system at shanghai disneyland, but honestly, I just didn't want to risk it). People may ask to take pictures with you if you're obviously not Chinese (I had like 6 chinese teenagers ask for pictures with me within 10 minutes!). Most everywhere in the park takes credit card, but we foudn one barbecue restaurant that didn't; we did end up being able to pay with card anyway, but it was a whole long process involving going to another restaurant in the same building. So have some cash on you if you want to keep things snappy. If you want to avoid squat toilets, they always have some western ""throne"" style toilets in the back of the restaurants, labeled with a drawing on the door. People will be obnoxious and take up like the whole sidewalk and area around them while taking pictures (with their smuggled in selfie sticks); feel free to just ignore them after a while. Also, you may see a lot of people randomly sleeping in public or at restaurants and stuff; that's just a cultural thing that's more accepted there, just go with it. And if you go in the summer,  bring a fan, a hat, an umbrella, and wear plenty of sunscreen; shanghai is SUPER HOT AND HUMID and you want to be prepared. Oh, and just as an observation - we were like one of the only couples we saw there; everyone else really seemed to just be there with their families and kids. :)Enjoy!"
433,3.0,Apr 2018,"Mornington Peninsula, Australia ",A very busy park,I have been to both Hong Kong Disney and Shanghai and I found the Hong Kong a better park that is designed more for foreign tourists. Shanghai seems to only be for the Chinese with nothing in english at all.
434,5.0,Jun 2018,"Davis, CA ",3rd Annual Visit,"My family has gone to Disney Shanghai every summer since it's opening summer. This was our 3rd visit. I have to say every visit has been surprising in regards to improvements. First of all, going to Disney Shanghai is incredibly crowded. Worse than Disney World. In past visits, just getting into the amusement park was an incredible pain. The lines were incredibly long, and hard to control. People were none stop cutting. I want to say that in general people line up pretty well, but if you've ever visited China, even when they line up well, they also take up every last inch of personal space possible. Then you have these scalpers, in chinese we call them Huang Niu. They are easy to spot because right before lining up, you'll see them calling out for VIP access for 400 yuan or something ridiculous. So what are you buying if you go with them? Basically when they will you barge up one side of the line, yelling ""VIP"" at the top of their lungs. And most chinese people in line will just back down and let them go. Not me or my husband. And last year, we got into a few shoving matches to the point we yelled for security. And as soon as security showed up, they run. Leaving the idiot people who paid for their services, scratching their heads. Anyways that was last year. This year, there was a separate entrance for people who stayed at the hotel. We always stay at the disneyland hotel. It's gorgeous. Very close the Pudong airport, so after a 12 hour flight, it's kind of nice to be at our hotel within 20 minutes. And it is also relatively affordable compared to other disneyland hotels we've stayed at in LA or Florida for example. I think this is because most people still stay in downtown Shanghai or somewhere even cheaper. So there was a bus that took us directly to Disney Springs, not even the main entrance, but the side entrance that took us straight to the side door for Disneyland. Most people had their tickets ready and went to line up. We had to go to the Grand Theater to finish buying our tickets, which isn't far from the line at all. Part of this was because this year we also bought the fast pass and VIP service. The side entrance line was great. It was maybe 20-30 minutes, not a lot of pushing or squeezing. And the best part was there was no scalpers. The fastpass has really changed this year. There's a bunch of different packages but we bought the one that came with 8 or so guarantee fastpasses for the major rides such as Tron. Every 2 hours you also get to select one extra one as long as they don't run out. You can do this straight from their APP. Well after the first 2 hour window, they ran out. I was able to get an extra set of rapids tickets for the family and that was it. So we got to go on about 8 different rides that day plus rapids twice. The fastpass was around $100 USD extra per person. I think it's very expensive, but the only way to do Disney Shanghai. You can download the Disney Shanghai app in advance and check line times, but some lines really are 3 hours long. And we were only there for 1 day, it's just not worth the wait in my mind. This year we were also there in late June versus early July. I don't know if we got lucky or what, but the weather was closer to 80 degrees F and it was much more comfortable and beautiful. The VIP experience was not worth it for us. It was to give us reserved space for the parade and the fireworks. We didn't really care for the parade and we never make it to the fireworks with our jetlag. My favorite rides there are still Tron and the completely different Pirates of the Caribbean. If you are more adventurous, there is a Discovery Trails where they strap you to a tether and you can choose one of three routes to climb around, but remember you have to wear closed toed shoes for that."
435,2.0,Jun 2018,"Colombo, Sri Lanka ",Such a disappointing experience ,"We spent extra to travel to Shanghai just to go to disneyland. It was crushing because the place didn't live up to the hype. Queues took about 2-4 hours which was absurd! Having spent the whole day we were at a loss for places to eat and was able to go on only about 4 rides.So sad that the staff didn't look very happy and the service to non-chinese speaking audince was less (rides and acts were in chinese).I wouldn't recommend going, but if you do go plan the trip to atleast go on the TRON ride and the Pirates one.

436,4.0,Mar 2018,"Miami, FL ",Disney with Chinese Characteristics,"Disney in Shanghai has not been opened for that long, but seems to operate smoothly. Dont go for the food though. The part is different from any other Disney's I have been too, with a mix of classic and new rides. As much else in China these days,, its is impressive but lacks the charm of Disney World and Disney Land in the US. If you love the pirates of Caribbean ride, you must visit it in Shanghai,,, it will blow you away,, nothing like the puppet show in the US... I went 3 times in a row just before closing on a week-day... the other rides are not particularly impressive and quite a few outright boring."
437,1.0,Jul 2018,N/A,Crush my dream,"After I visit Orlando Disney world, I feel like I want to work and live in Disney land forever. Every second there, it was like living in a dream. So I decided to visit every Disney park around the world. This summer, I spent 2 days in Shanghai Disney. This place CRUSHED my dream. It is just a  park titled with Disney. Pros:1, only the night time firework show has the magic power2, The princesses, there are very friendly.Cons:1. Dirty: When we were standing in line to get in the park, there were lots of overnight garbage on the floor.  Empty plastic bottles and food bags are inside the castle.  A dream place shouldn't be this dirty!!!2. Magic Smile:One of the impressive things in Orlando was every staff were smiling. Even I know they have been trained to do it. In Shanghai Disney land, except the costumed staff, others didn't meet Disney standard for friendliness; others were just grumpy.3. Food,Inside Disneyland, the water is expensive: 10 yuan to compare 2 yuan somewhere else. Food is expensive too. Chinese food is famous about its variety and taste but not there. The food there I only want to pay 1/3 of the money. However, the food in Disney town is very good and you will have 10% off if you show your ticket.4. inconvenient fast pass and slow wifi.In Orlando, we got a band which had our fast pass and personal data. The WiFi was very fast. I can easily scan my band to spend my fast pass and reenter the park. In Shanghai, the wifi was very slow and some part of the park does not have WIFI covered. It was frustrating to use the APP on my phone to scan the fast pass every time. We had to use an actual paper ticket to re-enter the park every time. This was so outdated. 5. Other than the park.1> We were there in July on the weekend, super hot and crowded. Most of the Chinese ladies have their umbrella with them to protect their skin from sun. We had to watch every  step we went to protect our eyes. 2> People cut lines especially young kids. It's holiday+weekend. There were lots of people. Young kids and even a young lady were cutting my lines. There was no personal space, or you will lose your spot. My 5 year old big fan princess daughter did not like there and couldn't wait to get out of there.   If you are a Disney fan, DO NOT go there. Your dream will be crushed."
438,1.0,Jul 2018,"Plymouth, UK ",Lets the Disney Company down,"I'm absolutely gutted the way I feel about this theme park, I am Disney mad and love Disney more than anything! I did a world trip of every single Disney park and left this one to last...This park is awful, no other Disney park is like this. The guest behaviour is just unbelievable I have seen a grown man going to the toilet in front of the castle, People constantly in the parks selling counterfeit items and staff DOING NOTHING about it, Chinese guest were shoving cameras in our faces, following us around the park trying ti take pictures of us, and the worst are the queues... the guest have no concept of queuing at all, they constantly try and push in front of one another to get to the front, it resulted in me arguing and firmly telling people no to many times and by the time I got to the ride I was exhausted and stressed. I went to guest services and stated all of this and I was told it is Chinese culture, well I don't think Disney should have built the park in Shanghai then...it doesn't matter were you go in the world it is Disney culture which caters for all nationalities not just 1! Also if you want a fast pass, they run out in an hour and you have to question 150 minutes for rides... This really crushed my dream of visiting every Disney in the world"
439,5.0,Nov 2017,China ,Nice park,Disney is always Disney! The park is brand new and you have the feeling that you are at the USA. Since it’s new it still doesn’t have many things as the one in Orlando. 
440,1.0,Jul 2018,"Santiago, Chile ",Not up to Disney International Standards,"The park was extremely crowed, I thinks it was because of school holidays, but they shouldn´t allow THAT amount of people. Once it is full you should close, as they do in orlando. We went on a thursday and arrived at 8AM (opnening time) and had to line up for about 40 minutes for the bag inspection before getting inside the park. When we got inside all the waiting times were 60 to 150 minutes, and it got worst through the day. We waited 3 hours for the rapids attraction. It was horrible. There were guards everywhere, staff didn´t spoke english, organization was bad, even for seating the guests inside the attractions. Shows are completely in chinesse, so not friendly for international visitors. Wifi only available with chinnese phone number. Fastpass only available with the app, and you need wifi for that, so imposible for us international guests. It is not prepared for international tourists. I love Disney, but hated this park. We have been to Hong Kong Disneyland, Orlando, California, Japan, and all perfect. Such a shame."
441,3.0,Jul 2018,N/A,Just okay,"First of all, do not buy tickets through Viator. We did and the tickets were NOT valid. We had to buy replacement tickets at the gate which worked out in our favor as they were cheaper! But what a hassle in an already crowded park. No need to buy ahead of time. Viator did refund our money once I contacted them. Orlando Disneyworld is so much better. The food and fireworks at Shanghai Disney were disappointing. Very crowded to the point that it sucked all the fun out of us even though we arrived around 5 pm thinking the crowd would be smaller. It was smaller as we rode TRON ( only in Shanghai). 1 hour wait the first time and 15 minutes the second time around. Once the fireworks were about to start, the crowd grew immensely. So crowded we could barely see any fireworks which were subpar anyway."
442,2.0,Jul 2018,"Mexico City, Mexico ",Filthy is the Word....and No English Spoken ,"Very disappointing was this Park. The first disappointing thing is that the “cast” by that we mean everyone don’t speak English, Spanish, nor French, so it’s not easy to communicate. The park is new but it has a problem with the garbage, it is very filthy, and not only by garbage. The one good thing was the “Pirates of the Caribbean” ride witch this new version is great. Would definitely not go back. We think that the Disneyland franchise is getting very devalued. Will definitely not go back to this park!"
443,2.0,Jul 2018,"Lopez Mateos, Mexico, ",Sorry to see the Disney Guest Experience abandoned. Do not go. Overcrowded. ,"At my 50 years of age I consider myself, or at least considered, a huge fan. There have been many many occasions when I had the privilege and joy to experience the Disney US parks in Anaheim and Orlando. I had the highest expectations for the relatively new Shanghhai Disneyland. Boy, was I disappointed...I took the entire family (my wife and four kids with ages ranging from 19 to 9). We bought the tickets with over a month anticipation, and decided to invest a whole day of our China - Japan trip in Disney, precisely for a grand finale... At 6:20am we took the subway Line 11 from Jiangsu Road station (close to the downtown area). For most of the ride the train was relatively empty; however, as we approached the Disney resort station the train was packed, and so was the way out. It took us almost an hour from the metro station (which is close to the park entrance) to the equivalent of Main Street, inside the park. The issue was not the subway, nor the tickets, it was just the unbelievable tides and waves of people through security and the turnstiles. By the time we could register our tickets in the app (and that was fast) we could only get a FastPass for Tron at 7:10pm... Soaring and the Rapids were already fully distributed, and a few minutes later all FastPasses were history. We went directly to Pirates of the Caribbean, and were in line for 50 minutes... At 9am most major attractions had waiting times between 2 and 3 hours. I my whole life, and having spent about 40 full days at Disney Parks my max historical records was like 90 minutes for Dumbo in Orlando, and that was because my girls wanted to ride on the purple hat flying elephant... Yesterday I spent over 3 hours in line for Soaring... A whole new record, and good element for discussion with my therapist...The maintenance level is not the same as you see in the US parks. There is a lot of trash inside the lines, and even as you go by. The staff cleaning cannot keep up because of the crowds. Some of the attractions, as Pirates of the Caribbean, closed because of technical challenges, creating more pressure on the other attractions which are few. I know Disney can make it better; however, for the time being, I felt, for the first time ever, that my ticket didn’t have a reasonable payback. I felt abused and cheated to put it in simpler words. Hopefully someone at Disney will read this, and consider my comments. I am fully open to provide more details. The reason I give 2 points out of 5, and not 1, is because a few of the attractions as Tron and Pirates are truly amazing and, really beautiful. Please don’t let the magical Disney guest experience deteriorate or end. My wife said she felt, at times, like she was in a Six Flags Park in Mexico... This is not the Disney standard. You have a great brand and reputation that could, and should last for endless generations. My pictures in pain, in the endless lines are not included. "
444,4.0,Jul 2018,New Jersey ,Need fast passes to enjoy,"You NEED it. Trust me. You better. Or else you’ll be waiting in line for a while and it’ll ruin your experience. Also be prepared for people trying to cut you. It’s different here than in Florida. 90% of the people here try to cut you and if you tell them off or prevent them, they’ll be upset at you because it’s ‘your’ fault. So be prepared. Go with others and make a barrier. They’ll usually send a little kid first to get through and then the others will follow them. And there will be people who will try to sell you things in line. Avoid eye contact as this will let them know that you are interested and they will bother you for the next 10 minutes. And it smells sometimes. People smoke where they’re not supposed to. Don’t be that person. :) As for the bathrooms.... they consist of mainly squatting toilets but there are western toilets in the back with toilet paper. It’s pretty clean. Now the rides. In my opinion, these rides are too good. If that’s a thing. Pirates and Tron are a must do. If you are lucky enough to get to Tron early when they start, the way you enter is cool. But only if the door to the ride hasn’t opened yet! And pirates.... oh words can’t describe that. Just ride it! Oh and they’re in Chinese. So good luck. (They also do pin trading)"
445,2.0,Jul 2018,N/A,Disappointing Disney (and AWFUL Viator) experience,"The Park was new and nice, yet it was very disappointing. Be prepared to queue for hours for rides and not to use FastPass unless you want to pay extra for it, as they give out a limited quantity for free, and then charge around $50 per person for a few FastPass tickets. Employees are NOT what you expect when comparing them to other international parks. Be prepared for very rude and offensive behavior from guests. We experienced a fist-fight between a woman and a female park employee which lasted for several minutes while management and security sat by and watched. DO NOT BUY ON VIATOR. we made this mistake and the day before we were supposed to go, they canceled our tickets due to “park at capacity.” We then found out that they would sell our tickets back to us for $25 per person. We were all the way in China, so we did, but got taken advantage of. Save your time and money and go to Tokyo Disney if you want an Asian Disney experience!"
446,4.0,May 2018,"Pune, India ",Nice time enjoyed,You can spend good time at this place nice and clean .Love the atmosphere and people around were very helpful.Do visit.
447,5.0,May 2018,"New Delhi, India ",Biggest and the best Disneyland,"If you are visiting the place with kids then I highly recommend staying at either Disney Resort Shanghai (if you have budgets) or at Toy Story Hotel (if you are budget conscious) because you cannot cover the park in one day unless you are just with your partner or friend. I stayed at Toy story with my family (have posted the reviews of the hotel separately) Shuttle from both resort or from hotels are readily available and that too with no extra charge. You can book your park tickets way in advance while booking the hotel or you can also buy the tickets from the hotel reception. As the park is quite far from the main Shanghai city (around an hour and a half drive) I strongly suggest staying closer to it. Coming to the Disneyland: The park was bigger than Japan's Tokyo Disney which we visited in the year 2015. Nice chain of restaurants just outside the park to relax and try few international cuisines after a day-long walk inside the park. Ther is a huge food court inside the park as well but better food options are just outside the park. If you love thrilling rides to pump up your adrenaline then this is one place you should not miss. If you want your family portraits with Mickey and Minnie then you might have to wait in long queues especially if you are visiting during weekends, try to visit during weekdays to avoid the crowd. Lots of theme park inside, boat rides & thrilling rides. Last but not the least don't miss the Sound & light show at around 8 pm (check the timings in the morning ) & The Mickey Parade. I visited the park in the month of May and the weather was awesome, it was drizzling on and off but a pretty nice weather to enjoy the park"
448,2.0,Jul 2018,"Sydney, Australia ","Nice hotels, Terrible park","Been to there with my 6 years old girl for her holiday, weather was hot and wet. Hotels are nice, been to both of them, park hotel is more suitable for those who enjoy nice food and swimming pool at the hotel while kids having fun at the park.The park, is one of the worst parks I have even been to (compare with the Tokyo's and the Hongkong's and Also some parks in Australia and China). They offer lots lots lots of shops but little entertainment. They really want people to just buy stuff, that's the only thing They care After the two days visit. And for those with younger kids and if you stay in the hotel, take your onw baby trolley and do not expect to go rent one at the park. At a hot day, the little one will get dehydrated even before you reach the front gate from the shuttle bus drop off point."

450,4.0,Jul 2018,"Westfield, NJ ",Fast Pass Bundle is Critical,"Purchasing the fast pass bundle is critical to having a good time. We entered the park via the side entrance reserved for Disney hotel guests around 6:50am and it still wasn’t early enough to avoid the long queue for the Soaring or the Pirate ride. Lucked out on a five minute wait for Tron though,.... Purchased fast pass bundles around 7am and was able to go on five of the popular rides within 4 hours w/ time for the kids to shop as well. No fast pass the day before and we were only able to go on three rides in six hours with no time to shop. The fast pass bundle is completely worth it!!!Not as much shoving and pushing in the fast pass line. Be prepared to have no personal space. People will generally stop pushing when you firmly tell them to stop."
451,4.0,Jul 2018,"Jakarta, Indonesia ","Shanghai Disneyland, July 3-4 2018","Shanghai’s disneyland has the most coolest technology. The rides there were so fun. My fave is actually the Tron lightcycle and pirates of the carrabean. My family and i bought the 2 day ticket. On day 1, we managed to get on 8 rides without having to wait for so long. On day 2, we rode all of the rides that we din’t ride on day 1, again without having to wait for so long. The place is really crowded but it rained quite a lot on day 2 so people rather find shelter than riding rides. We ride roaring rapids, soaring, tron on day 2 at night when everybody is watching the fireworks. We queued for those rides less than 10 mins. It was really fun and worth it to go there.I already went to tokyo’s disnyeland, hongkong’s, florida’s disneyworld and i have to say that shanghai’s disneyland has the worst staff. The staffs there are so unfriendly and they never smile. They keep frowning as they explain the rules of the rides. I mean its an international theme park and its DISNEY. Also the people there are always trying to cut lines or attempting to slip in front. I tried smiling to the staffs and they gave me a frown in return. They din’t even say “enjoy your ride” or “see you soon”. But overall me and my fam dont really give a fck about the staffs and we had a really good time there because we succeeded in riding all of the rides there and the longest time we had to wait is only 40 mins. Oh and 1 more thing, fastpasses are free and you an get them through the disney resort app. So you kinda have to like fight for the fastpass before they run out. And you can only get a fastpass for every 1-2 hours. Unless you stay at the disney resort, not only that the resort booked a fastpast the night before your ride, you also get to come in to the park earlier than all the other guests. Now im wishing i could go back there hehehe"
452,4.0,Jul 2018,N/A,Shanghai Disneyland,"There are many reviews on how terrible Shanghai Disneyland is, but it is actually quite enjoyable if you know how to go around the issues. Firstly, to make it clear, the place is not dirty as some reviews mentioned, it is actually quite clean with the army of cleaners present. Language barrier there is for foreign visitors, as most of the staff do not speak anything else other than Mandarin, but with the bulk of the visitors being locals, I guess they don't see the need to recruit many English or other languages speaking staff. It's no different from being in Tokyo where most people speak Japanese or in Switzerland, where French or German are mainly spoken, a visitor just have to learn to get by using hand signals and pointing at pictures in the guide booklets or pamphlets. Yes, the queues for rides are exceptionally long but the locals go around it by purchasing fast pass tickets from online agents, which depending on the price, could even include a tour guide for completing Disneyland Shanghai's rides in the shortest possible time. For my visit, the longest ride queuing time on a weekday was about 20 minutes. In comparison, the regular queues took as long as 2.5 hours. Although many complained about the prices of food and drinks, I find them comparable to other tourist attractions. Moreover, 60 yuan digital vouchers could be purchased online from Taobao to pay for meals that costs 80 yuan at the cash register. That represent a 25% discount for a good tasty meal with drinks included. I thought the Chinese are quite innovative and they find ways to go around rules in the most creative ways and in turn, facilitate visitors who are in the know to really enjoy Disneyland Shanghai in a most leisurely manner. Obviously, those who do not know will be disadvantaged. In comparison, Tokyo Disneyland where rules are strictly followed, the long queues often turn off people with lower patience threshold. Do note that unlike Disneyland Parks elsewhere, there's no ""Small, Small World"" ride in Disneyland Shanghai, but don't miss ""Pirates of the Carribean"", it's really enjoyable. I would also recommend staying at the Toy Story Hotel near the Park instead of travelling all the way from the City to Disneyland."

Have a great plan to get out of there after the fireworks. We stayed outside the park and it worked out well were able to get a Didi (Uber)."
455,3.0,Jul 2018,"Surabaya, Indonesia ",Disneyland with a serious problem,"Reading all the review about Shanghai Disneyland, we tried to be savvy: spent two days in the park, Wednesday and Thursday... both are on weekdays.  Arrived 30 minutes before the park gate open.   We bought the ticket on line to cut the queue.   We downloaded SD apps on our mobile phones as well.    And what we got?On both days, we missed the fastpass for Soaring, Roaring and Seven Dwarfs!   How could that happen?    By the time our ticket valid (meaning we passed the entrance gate), around 8.15, the fastpass for those 3 attractions is gone!   It was unbelievable.  It happened exactly the same on the second day.     By 8.15, the fastpass for those favorite three were no more available.  Fastpass left were Tron and Pirates of Carribbean.   So disappointing!  Something must be very very wrong with the fastpass system.   Having no choice, we had to wait 180+ minutes for each favorite attraction.  So, for 1 day in the park, we can only try 3 attractions, 2 musical shows plus the fireworks.  Some attractions is so swift: Tron is only 60 second-ride.. does it worth 120 minute waiting time?    I do hope it is not the strategy of the SD management.  The bright side of this park are: cleanliness, some English-spoken staff, well kept, the variety of attractions and the number of restaurants.  Although the restaurants mostly cater for local guests, but the taste is acceptable.   Some local people tried to push us and overtaking the line during queuing.   And some local men also offered us assistance to shortcutting the long queue for 100 RMB.   We are not sure how he do it.   In narrowest, SD is definitely NOT the happiest place on earth.   Although the park still has some positive aspects, if you still wish to visit SD, you need a huge patience as huge as the park itself."
456,3.0,Jun 2018,N/A,The least magical experience we've had so far,"We have been to Disney World, Disneyland, Paris Disneyland, Tokyo Disneyland and Hong Kong Disneyland.  This was my least favorite experience of them all and unless you really wanted to visit all Disney properties I would say you could skip this one.  First of all it was very crowded.  The line to enter the park was very long and although there weren't many people in line we had to walk probably a half mile to even get to the front of the line (could have easily closed off some of the lines so everyone didn't go back and forth).  Cast members (employees) didn't seem Disney friendly and the guests here seemed to be the rudest/pushiest of any I've seen.  We literally had to hold people back from cutting in front of us in line and spent at least 3-4 rides in the two days we were there feeling as though there were people crawling up our backs trying to get by us in line (NO personal space).  Obviously this depends on who is there that day but it's the most uncomfortable I've ever been traveling throughout Asia or any other country.In addition, the park was extremely dirty.  Generally Disney everything is picked up within moments of being put down but everywhere we went and every ride we went on people seemed to just set dirty glasses/bottles/napkins/trash down and it really just seemed disappointing/dirty compared to any Disney experience I've ever had.My husband and I joked that maybe this wasn't really a Disney park because of our disappointment in all the small details that Disney usually has down to a science.  I'm glad I visited as I LOVE Disney and it is fun to compare but I will not have this on my list to return to.  Tokyo Disney on the other hand I can't wait to go back there so if you're picking a park in Asia my preference would be Tokyo 1st, then Hong Kong Disney and then if you had to go because it was your only option, Shanghai Disney.... otherwise your money would be much better spent elsewhere.  We did say if we were to do it again that we would only come for one day and stay in the city/come by train and then pay the expensive fee to skip the lines/have a guide to get through all the rides and be done."
457,3.0,Jul 2018,kuala lumpur ,Shanghai disneyland trip,Its my first time at disneyland shanghai.. surprisingly its clean unlike what i heard. Just that the locals love to cut queue.. its very annoying.. i think like 90% of the visitor is locals.
458,2.0,Jun 2018,"Orlando, FL ",Not Magical at all!!!,"We traveled to China to visit the last two Disneyland parks. We researched ALOT on Shanghai Disneyland and felt we were prepared for the crowds.  We came an hour early before opening on a weekday.We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel with the “secret “ entrance which was a huge help because I could see the crowds from our hotel and they started lining up at 7 when the park opened at 9.  We had 1 fast pass per ticket per day reserved by being a hotel guest. We chose Seven Dwarf one day and Soaring the next as the concierge advised they “ sell out” of Fastpasses every day by 9 :30 or 10.  That was true both days for us.Despite the preparation, I was shocked at what happened. When we lined up to enter is when I saw everyone (mostly Chinese) on their phones on the App waiting to enter the park to get Fastpasses and premier access.  As soon as we turned the turnstiles into the park the race was on!!!! People booking and buying passes while RUNNING at top speed. I have been to all Disneyland parks now and I have NEVER seen people act so crazy!!!I too logged on to get a fast pass and realized at 8:57 most rides were “ unavailable “ meaning sold out.  I heard a noise, looked over and saw literally thousands of Chinese people running at me to get to Tron. We walked faster and by the time I made the 3 minute walk there was an hour wait!!!!!It was obvious this day would be miserable if I didn’t do the Premier Access. I logged into the app and dropped $300 to get Fastpasses for 6 or 8 rides.  If it weren’t for that money spent we may have ridden 3 things in 2 days. Three-4 hours per ride was common. Waiting in line is also a test of survival. Cutting, pushing, shoving, talking loudly, eating, spitting, staring and pointing( I’m white and my kids are Asian) made lines unbearable!!!If you can’t spring for the  Premier, you must do Tron and Pirates ( completely unlike other Disneyland pirates rides).  The Alice in Wonderland maze was crowded but worth seeing because its so unique. Soaring is exactly like Epcot version.Seven Dwarfs is also the same as Disney world. Rex’s racers is like something you can ride at every carnival. Pooh and Peter Pan are not different either. The water ride was the same as all the rest too.I cannot even begin to describe the behavior for the fireworks. Stay far back or you may literally be crushed. People push and shove, there are no workers there to maintain order. Think kids climbing lampposts, no ropes, people on the streets, no paths marked to walk.  I was pushed into a lamppost by the crowd of ever moving people and gashed my arm. Food was good. Pinocchio restaurant had delicious vegetarian Mickey shaped pizzas.  Some interesting snacks. We liked the corn in Toyland with the truffle mayonnaise. Not like Tokyo on the food though.Overall, I can say I have been here and survived to tell the tale. Never again. The people’s behavior made this beautiful park that should be magical into a miserable place.  "
459,4.0,Jun 2018,"Shanghai, China ","Magical experience, great place for families. But beware of the crowds!!!","Disney has done a great job of integrating technology, mobile app, fantasy & imagination, movie characters, merchandise, sounds & light and roller coasters into one memorable experience. The place is designed with all age groups in mind, which makes it a great family destination. The evening show projected on the castle is the biggest draw, getting the entire park together. But the long queues and even longer waiting times, with people hustling and jostling can make the experience quite overwhelming. If you are not quick enough to grab a fast pass, then you need to be extra patient to get through the day."
460,3.0,Jul 2018,N/A,Average Disney experience ,"Do note that most shows are in mandarin. Even if you do not speak Chinese, you can roughy understand the plot and enjoy the action scenes. You have to enter the park during opening hours to have the chance to get the fast pass for popular rides. Download the Shanghai Disneyland app before visiting as you can apply for fast pass and view waiting times there. Food options are pretty mediocre and expensive and you are not allowed to bring food inside the park. There are 2 parades everyday, these are the times where queues are the shortest, use this to your advantage. If you are here only for 1 day, it is highly reccomend to get the 5-attraction experience pass. It cost around 500+ RMB on top of your 300+ RMB entrance ticket. Get the fast pass for Soaring over the horizon first as they run out by 8.30am. You have to wait 2 more hours before you can get your next fast pass. Peterpan is usually available until 11am. Queue for Tron at night as that is when they turn on the beautiful lights. Be prepared to queue 20-30 minutes in advance for shows as they are usually packed. Bring an umbrella and portable fans to make your experience less horrible. I personally feel that Hong Kong Disneyland is way more magical. But if you’re in Shanghai, this would probably do. "
461,3.0,Mar 2018,"Suzhou, China ","Lots of great new attractions, but disappointing staff.","There were plenty of great rides and attractions, but honestly Disney is supposed to be a magical place with smiling faces overall.  I realize it's all fake and everything, but I think that's all part of the Disney fun!Staff wasn't friendly at all, and I was surprised at the lack of English knowledge."
462,5.0,Jun 2018,"Wuxi, China ",Great Place but 1 day is not enough,"I went to Shanghai Disneyland on a Tuesday. It was very crowded as many school groups were there since it was the last week of school until September. I was only able to get 1 FastPass after going through the gate using the app. Highlights:TRON - The best launch rollercoaster I have ever been on. Although the rider sits in the seat crouched like riding a bike, there is 1 train designed for people who physycally cannot be crouched into the locking back plate, or are of a larger size where the rider sits upright.Soaring Over the Horizon - Awesome ride using OMNIMAX and motion seating. The views of the Great Wal of China were awesome/Pirates of the Caribbean - Really good animitronics that really looked like Johnny Depp. Visual effects are stunning.Sever Dwarfs Mine Train - very good and very fun rollercoaster.Camp Discovery Challenge Trails - This was a physical activity that involves putting on a harness and a safety lanyard. The attraction has 3 courses all with 3 levels of challenges for each section of the trails. The harnesses and lanyard are for your safety in case you slip and fall doing one of the more challenging levels.There were also many other jewels to see if only you relax and take it slowly. My second day (Wednesday) had fewer people in the park and I was able to catch more attractions and shorter que lines.Complaints:Low availability of FastPasses. It seems that when you get in the park, most of the passes were gone and only a few were left with all the times being late afternoon or evening. You can only get 1 FastPass, then you have to wait for 2 hours until you can get another. The problem was there were no more FastPasses available after 10:00 AM.Lack of air conditioned spaces for eating. For example, I wanted to eat at the Toy Story Lunch Box because of the variety of cuisine. Get there and it is open air with very little shade. No wonder there were very few people eating at this place. All of the places to eat indoors were crowded because it was hot and humid."
463,5.0,Jun 2018,"San Francisco, CA ","went at night, lovely... not sure about during the day","So we bought tickets online - print out the confirmation code and bring it to the gate entrance along with the passport that was used to purchase the ticket. The ticket agent will type in your passport and pull up your ticket. Super simple.Once you are in, it feels magical. Yeah, cheesy, but it really is like stepping into a stressless, beautiful place. Music is piped throughout the park and it serves to mute out the otherwise chatter of thousands of people.Now, though we bought tickets for the whole day, we did not go to the park until 6pm. And even at that time, it was unbearably hot - there is very little shade in and our the park.I couldn't imagine enjoying the park at high noon.While many of the Disneyland staff were nice, I would say the other half need to improve their customer service game (dismissive, annoyed).The best ride by far was Tron - highly recommended. By 8pm, the wait without fast pass was 50 minutes, but by 9pm, the wait was maybe 10.I think a good strategy for Shanghai Disney is to buy a 3-day pass and go three days in a row from 6-10pm. This way you not only avoid the heat, but also the crowds."
464,5.0,Nov 2017,"Gaspereau, Canada ",Happiest place on Earth!,"We arrived early in the morning, my daughter and son were sleeping on the subway. We stayed and spent the entire day. I don't have enough space to tell you how amazing it was and yes they speak English. We finally left as they were shutting down for the night. An entire day at Disney with my wife's entire family was insane (in a good way)"
465,1.0,Jun 2018,"Huizhou, China ","Worst Disneyland I have ever been to.....I have been to quite a few in HK, Calif., Japan.","Well, this is a big Disneyland park but the size of this park did not make it a fun place. There are probably 7-8 really good attractions that you'd like to go on but walking between these different attractions takes a lot of walking. We went on a Monday, thinking there would be fewer people and there I think were fewer people compared to weekends.Few people in Cities like Shanghai doesn't mean a lot fewer literally. It was forecasted to rain yesterday but there was not a cloud in site and it was hot and sunny, 91'F degrees, 36C. It was so hot that you cannot walk around without your whole face sweating and a small cheap towel you can buy elsewhere for at most 3RMB costs 35RMB. This park is a scam. There are waits of up to 150 minutes on most rides but you can buy a single fast pass for 150RMB extra. So we ended up buying the entrance tickets plus having shell out another 300RMB on every ride since who would want to wait 120-150 minutes for rides that are like a few minutes long at most. Everything was expensive here, a pin that costs at most 10RMB to make costs 150-250RMB each. I cannot tell you the different scams they have going, there are so many....mostly in their products that are so way overpriced. Eating a plate of crappy cafeteria food with two drinks is 100RMB. Very few water fountains around, a bottle of water is 10RMB. The park is very big but basically is all in the middle of the park where there are no rides but scrubs and a few trees and statues where people can take photos, and you know the Chinese love taking their photos. There is an area where there are restaurants and shops from the outside but that is another long walk from the park. Chinese people love to push and shove like there's no tomorrow....it's like getting ahead of someone is something they are born to do. This park is big without substance, attractions too far from one to another so prepare to walk and if you go in the summer, bring a towel to dry your face, bring some extras because your sweat will come down into your eyes and it stings. An Ice cream bar is 40RMB, a stuffed animal depending on which one you get is 300+RMB. There are also many shady scalper types walking around asking people if they'd want to get fast passes and not have to wait. One guy quoted me something like 11,000RMB for a private tour of 3 hours and go on rides without waiting. The Disney app has these premiere fast pass tickets to sell for up to about 8 different rides for close to 900RMB extra. I just feel sorry for the ordinary folks who pay for the entrance ticket and finding out the wait times and have no extra money to buy these overpriced fast passes. This is totally unfair....I am blessed that I had extra money to spend on my daughter and was able to buy these fast passes. I am just wondering if this was the intent of Walt Disney when he built his first park in Anaheim. I doubt that it was.....I'm sure he wanted people to enjoy his park and not have to fork out their live savings to do so. Will never return again and will advise everyone not to. THIS DISNEYLAND IS A TOTALLY RIP OFF AND DISCRIMINATE THOSE THAT ARE NOT AS WELL OFF. Imagine standing in line for one and half hour or more in the 90+ degree heat to get on a ride for 2 minutes at most is something you'd like to do then I have nothing more to say. STAY AWAY from this legal money grabbing thief pretending to be a big company that entertains people. What a joke."
466,3.0,Jun 2018,"Sydney, Australia ",No Disney magic,"The park is set up very nicely, like stepping into a story book. Rides are also enjoyable. Maybe it was the crowds, the indifferent staff or the heat but felt this was like any other theme park, no magical moments.Tron ride was very impressive, as was the Tarzan acrobatics show. Food is very expensive but very poor quality. Just under 100yuan for a frozen Hawaiian pizza and a drink. Corn on the cob was 25yuan. I don’t mind paying for food but everything tasted really bad.Took us about 30 walk from the station. It’s actually only about 10min walk away but the crowd control barriers result in a maze like walk.We arrive at the station 15min prior to 8am opening and there was already a sea of people. Went on a busy long weekend - dragon boat festival. Rides were 40-200min long. We had been stalking the app the week prior to arrival and didn’t really perceive a huge increase in waits for weekends. It was always long! There is free WiFi. We had already downloaded app and vpn activated prior to arrival. There is a code to use which they will send to your phone. We had international sim with no roaming data so needed the WiFi!This allowed us to get the tron fast pass for the late afternoon as soon as we passed through the gates. You are allowed to access fast pass again once your ride has completed or 2hrs elapsed. By the 2hr mark when we could try, which was about 10am, nothing was available.Not wanting to suffer in the lines we purchased the premium access through the app. This is a paid for fast pass. The pricing was equivalent to entry ticket but I believe it fluctuates based on how busy it is in certain days.This allowed us to see the park in 1 day, completing 2 shows, 7 rides and fireworks. Wrapped up at 8.30pm.We used metro to get there which was fast and cheap.I didn’t get a sense that this was the happiest place on earth or that it offered anything unique. I would skip unless you have time or money to spare in your shanghai itinerary. There are much better parks elsewhere."
467,4.0,Jun 2018,"Singapore, Singapore ",Disneyland Shanghai,"CrowdsMad mad mad crowded we were there on a Monday and if the crowd represented the weekday numbers, weekend numbers must be scary, think queues everywhere - food lines / toilets / rides/ entry. You need the patience of a saint to queue. To combat the mad queue to gain entry into park - stay at toy story hotel (budget) or disneyland hotel (non budget) - the room key will get you direct entry into park from disneytown hence avioding the crowd at the regular entry point. I thought the queue for entry was bad at the japan disneyland - the shanghai one was twice as bad. Fast passes run out quick. On the day I was there, they ran out by 11 am for all rides. To save time, buy disney access pass - 440 rmb for 7 of main rides. This will save you time and the average 2-3 hour wait per ride. Alternatively, take your rides between 12-3 pm and 7-9 pm respectively , queues are shorter during these times because people are having lunch or watching the fireworks. Yes people do behave badly with the shoving and line cutting. Be firm and do not be afraid to call them out! CostsDisney is expensive here - average cost of a hotdog and a drink will set you back an average of 60-70 rmb (sgd 13), water costs 10 rmb, there are water fountains but I would not recommend this. Souvenirs are the same as every park - standard t shirts / mickey ears. There will be touts selling fake stuff outside the park. I am not sure why disney allows this - the touts aren't pushy , just decline and be on your way if you are not interested. disneytown has good restaurants and a food court,  options will meet every budget. RidesTron is amazing! Ride at night for surreal experience. Soaring is good but the original at Epcot is better. Pirates has been updated and is very good too. The effects are amazing! Snow white mine trains is fun and cute - take at night for birds eye view of park - different perspective all together. Sleeping beauty castle is huge and lighted pink, very nice. Peter pan's flight has been updated - very nostalgic . The parade starts at noon. Mulan's float is super impressive. No princess except the frozen girls howvever.  Astro blasters is the same as the one in HK / Japan.  Poohs honey hut is the same as the HK one.  Shanghai disney is a massive park , bring good walking shoes! Toy story land is almost the same as HK  except for one ride.Would I go again - yes, when they expand."
468,3.0,May 2018,N/A,Few seconds of rides after hours of waiting,"Just like other Disneys, with some amazing rides - esp Pirates of the Carribean, Peter Pan. But very very long waiting queues - least 45 mins to 150+ mins. Even the Fast Track pass does not help. We went on 2 days, yet could not get entry into some of the major rides. Quite disappointed, actually."
469,4.0,May 2018,"Brooklyn, NY ","Buy the VIP pass, or don't bother going - though it's a great park!","I went to this magnificent part with three colleagues. All of us are in the themed attraction business and were eager to experience the park . I was the only ""newbie"", the other three had been previously and knew that VIP was the only way to attend. Through the Disney park app we linked our four tickets so that one person could scan us all in (hassle, they need the magic bracelets from magic kingdom). The VIP pass allows you to enter the ""Fast Pass"" line ONCE for each ride in the app. Not all rides are included, but the best are:  Pirates of the Caribbean, TRON, PeterPan, Soaring, and more.  We waited in a ""short"" line for Crystal Grotto and it took a sweltering one hour...not bad by the standards of this park, We were there on a weekday thank goodness.   Food options are many, Toy Story land was cute and new, but not great.  Pirates is SUPERB and I loved the extended Peter Pan ship ride. Quite entertaining.  A colleague was fluent in Chinese so we didn't suffer from a language barrier, but didn't feel we needed to engage with park personnel for too many reasons.  We managed to master the app, though it sounds like others here struggle. The Alice Queen of Hearts maze is beautiful and fun to walk through, plenty of photo ops. Beautiful details abound.  If you want to see all Disney parks, this is fun...but I wouldn't recommend folks traveling to China as tourists make the trip. There's so MUCH more to see in China, I'd leave Disney for your home park experience...whether Orlando, Anaheim, Paris or Hong Kong."
470,4.0,Jun 2018,"Toronto, Canada ",1st visit to Shanghai Disneyland ,"Amazing park with some very different attractions. Will never complain again about walk from resort bus stop to Epcot entrance again!! In Shanghai, walk  from cab drop off to extremely long and hot security line was 15 minutes and then 45 minutes in security line. Pushing and shoving and lots of garbage left behind in this line. Very sad!! Once through security in the park in less than 10 minutes. My husband, daughter and I purchased the Disney premier access pass which was pricey however well worth the $. Allows you fast pass access for any ride that requires a fast pass. Soaring was 2 1/2 hours wait time!! We were there one day and did and saw it all in mostly no time at all. Pirates of the Caribbean not be missed!!  Incredible twists and turns along the way that made you think it was pure magic!!Most attractions were in Chinese - stitch’s encounter, Miners train and Winnie the Pooh to mention a few. A very hot and humid day when we visited and very hard to find a cool spot to have a drink and relax. Mostly walk in service and then outside in the heat. Found one area by pirates that we could sit and relax in the ac. Area is much like blue bayou at Disneyland. Because of the lack of ac in dining areas we chose to eat in the castle for dinner. Food was quite good, cool and quieter atmosphere, Mickey, Minnie, Donald and Daisy visited. Purchased the private fireworks dining package. After dinner we were escorted to an area directly in front of the castle. Best viewing and also worth it. All in all a great day. Walked through Disney Downtown to get a cab. Cab line was huge and 30 minutes in that line. Lots and lots of walking and extreme heat but if you are prepared for it you can make it a fun experience!!  4 down and 2 to go//Hong Kong and Tokyo next!!"
471,4.0,Jun 2018,"Singapore, Singapore, ",Best ride at a Disneyland ,"There are three things you need to know about Shanghai D’land. They sell alcohol here, like beer and slushes. The Tron lightcycle is the best ride at any D’land anywhere. Superb build-up, execution and ride. Third, good things come to those who wait and wait. We bought tickets online but you cannot yet fastpass unless you have the physical tickets on hand and by the time we did the fast passes for the day were all gone. So budget lots of time. "
472,3.0,Jun 2018,"Cape Town, South Africa ",The waiting game....,We went there yesterday which was a Saturday so it was very busy. Being a South African we couldn't buy our tockets on the App as we are not listed as an option. We also have Android phones so we couldn't even download the App because Google Playstore is blocked. Thus we couldn't get any Fastpasses....We arrived at 9 and left after six and we only managed 4 rides. The queues at each ride was 120 minutes waiting time! The rides were really a great thrill though! TRON was so exhilarating! The Pirates of the Caribbean ride was also really worth the wait. We managed Rex the Racer as well but by then we were so tired of waiting that I just wanted it to get it over with. Was it worth it? I would say so....but if we had a day open during the week I think it would have been a lot better. 
473,3.0,Jun 2018,N/A,Unmagical Magic Kingdom,"Let's started with the Disney account. In order to buy the Disneyland ticket online, I had to make a Disney account. I made one and I couldn't get the verification pin via sms( I requested the pin almost 20 times). I end up buying ticket from travel agent.I went here with my family on June 18th,2018. We were amazed by how big & beautiful this park was. It was peak season, so I decided to make full advantage on digital fast passes. But, I couldn't do it because I couldn't get that pin verification. I asked the staffs for help but they couldn't too. One my family member was irritated but managed to stay calm. Kudos for the employee over there who stay calm, nice, and smiling. The problem was that they couldn't communicate using english fluently. Maybe that's why I couldn't make Disney account.Walking arround the big park was superb. The attractions were fantastic. We really enjoy ""Soaring Over The Horizon"" and ""Pirates of The Carribean"".  When we were using our premier acess on Soaring Over The Horizon, we asked to be on the middle  part, which we already were. But the employee directed us to the side part. I think he did it on purpose.The atrractions were told using Chinese. It wasn't a problem. The problem is they don't bother to provide subtitle. It really made us feel less magical when we were playing.The other UNMAGICAL things were how the staffs act. They didn't smile, yelled a little, couldn't speak english at all (only few staffs could). When you were in Disneyland, you supposed to be able to feel the Disney spirit. It should be cheerful and relax. Most of the staffs were simply ignorant and rude.The other visitor also quite rude. I went to the lavatory and saw a woman getting out of a booth. When I entered the booth, I saw human feces on the toilet seat (only a speckled) and tissues on the floor. I wondered if that woman did that or not. I don't think the staffs was at fault. It was simply the visitor's fault.Actually, I don't know if I want to visit this Disneyland Shanghai again. I went to Disneyland Hongkong and I felt better even the park was smaller and old. The Disneyland HK's staff were also more helpful, nice, and better at communication.   I can feel the magic of Disney. While Disneyland Shanghai is just a majestic theme park..nothing more."
474,2.0,Jun 2018,"Buckingham, UK ",Worst Disney,"I have now been to all the Disney Parks. Sad to say this was POOR. Reason. Some rides had waits for TWO hours. The only way out of this is to buy a Privilege Pass.OK  IF you can afford it!!That to me smacks of Elitism, which I'm sure Disney wasn't created for. I visited Hong Kong Disney  and the two parks are as different as "" Night and Day"".The best ride was ""Pirates"""
475,4.0,Jun 2018,"Singapore, ",Had a blast at Summer Blast!,"We were at the park over their 3 day weekend for the Dragon Boat Festival. Monday was a peak day with higher ticket prices but it was just as crowded on Tuesday. We spent 2 days at the park, which will allow you enough time to take in the park. Because of the crowds, we opted not to queue for the rides as everything was at least 60 minutes and above (we saw a 180 min wait for Soaring at one point!). We only managed to grab only 1 Fastpass each day as the FPs were all more or less gone by noon.Pro-tip 1: Download the SHDL app, it gives updates on the wait times and you can also use it to get the Digital Fastpass. Pro-tip 2: Stay at the resort hotel for a few good reasons: (a) hotel guests priority entrance at Disneytown (b) purchasing tickets through the hotel will get you an additional advance FP (c) your shopping can be sent to the hotel instead of having to lug them all over the placePro-tip 3: Wear your best walking shoes because this park is MASSIVE with inclinesWe also got to see their Summer event, so there was some nice summer-beach themed deco around the park. Their Summer Blast show was fantastic with great music and dancing! The first day we were in the dry zone and could only watch in envy as the spectators in the wet zone got dripping wet. So the following day we went back and committed ourselves to getting really really wet, which was just as well because it was starting to get quite hot! They weren't kidding when they said wet; we looked like we went swimming fully clothed. I brought an extra plastic bag to keep my bags dry and they were also handing out clear pouches for your handphones.Halal food is available at the Food Republic at Disneytown. You will have to get a prepaid card from the service counter for your purchases. Food prices are higher than in the city, 40-45 yuan for a rice or noodle meal but it was tasty.Yes, we saw some of that ugly crowd behaviour but there were more positive interactions than negative ones. SHDL sells Premier Access passes, which is essentially a priority admission pass. It's a pricey compromise if you do not want to stand in line. My casual observations suggests that the pricing seems quite predatory; the passes were more expensive on Tuesday, a non-peak day, and it could possibly be linked to the weather forecast (it rained for almost half the day, could the PA passes be a way of keeping the people in the park?). We also noticed that the standby times were inflated a bit, further encouraging people to fork out for these passes? In any case, we came close to buying them ourselves but they were too pricey (as much as a one day ticket per person!)Overall, it's a nice park best visited off-peak (whenever that is) and with older children. Plenty of merchandise but not as creative as the Tokyo resorts."
476,5.0,Dec 2017,"Shanghai, China ",Wonderful and Magical Experience,"I suppose I had picked a pretty lucky time or I'm used to the number of people, but I couldn't complain about there being many people. Enjoyed the rides and would highly recommend the Tron one and the Pirates of the Carribean one (which is spoken in Chinese, but the experience is highly enjoyable and you wouldn't be bothered by it anyway). The parade and fireworks were a magical experience. You can have a fast pass to skip the lines, and while you're not waiting there are many things to do. Food is a bit pricey for me, but if you want to buy some items, make sure to be there in the morning to grab an early bird special! Definitely worth coming to if you're visiting Shanghai."
477,1.0,Jun 2018,"Des Moines, IA ",Foreigner Service is terrible.,I am very unhappy with the pre-visit service for foreigners. I booked a ticket using their app to prevent having to take my passport to the park as amusement parks are not the safest places for precious documents but after I paid they said I have to bring my passport to claim the ticket.  I then tried to send a message on their instant message chat and they would only write to me in Chinese. They gave me a Chinese number to call but I am not in China so international calling doesn't sound pleasant.  This is China and lines suck so I ordered online but still have to wait in a line with my PASSPORT! to get the ticket then enter the park. I asked if there is an e version of the ticket or if they can send it to me and have gotten no reply. If I could use any plastic ID to varify my identity that would be ok but a paper passport document is just too much risk and VERY ill thought out by Shanghai Disney.
478,4.0,Jun 2018,"Mossel Bay, South Africa, ",Magic spoiled by too many people,"This was my sixth Disneyland experience, but the first in Shanghai. The park and its attractions are amazing and is filled with the characteristic Disney magic, but it was spoiled by too many people that are allowed to enter the park. All the popular rides had queues of 2-3 hours. We were lucky to find Pirates of the Caribbean with only a 40 minute waiting time. The fact that we went on a “quiet” weekday makes me wonder how it would be on a weekday or public holiday.The fireworks display at 8:30pm was the highlight of the day, but you had to find a good spot to sit at least 90 minutes in advance.Disneyland should lower the limit for the number of people to enter the park. This was an extreme 人山人海 People mountain People Sea experience "

However, majority of visitors are locals from different provinces of China... To resolve this, you have to download the app for Shanghai Disney and avail the fast pass as early as possible. I recommend Tron, Soaring over the horizon., Pirates of the Caribbean, 7 dwarfs and rapids. We arrived early (opening time) and saw lots of trash outside the resort left by visitors as food bought outside not allowed. Inside is clean, they do their best to make the park clean as possible although its hard to maintain especially if there are people who don’t cooperate. Washrooms are well maintained but don’t be surprise to see some grannys have their kids pee on plants hehe! If you love rides, its time consuming and must go back for the second time.

For one month get the stamina to stand for at least 7-8 hours, walk for 10 kms.. cause you will have to do this for at least 3 days to see the full park. It's no kidding. Some of the rides had a wait for 3 hours. This is ridiculous. If these are such long waits then why allow so many people in the park. Just restrict the no of people so all could enjoy. We bought our tickets a month in advance but still they were selling tickets on the spot. Why sell more tickets if everyone has to wait for 3 hours for a 3 minute ride? Simple answer Greed I guess. There is no thought of customer experience. It was really hell. Yes rides we're good, fresh and fun. But while experience gets robbed with the effort goes behind it. Am not coming back here. "
485,4.0,Jun 2018,N/A,So magical!,"This place is amazing, it is definitely disney!Pros.The obvious, youre in disneyland!The toilets are clean! Which is a definite relief.The whole place is clean, there are cleaners going around every minute of the day. It is not as big as other disney parks. I put this as a pro because 1 day in the park and we went around 4 or 5 times. Anaheim we struggled with 2 days.The smoking areas are nice, relaxing and out of the way. This is how they should be at all parks.All the workers we talked to spoke at least basic english which was great!Cons.The lines are ridiculous! They put up barricades before the security check which means soo much unnecessary walking. The walk from the carpark to the gate and then you deal with the lines. Most of the rides dont have the waiting times so make sure to download the app before you get there.The character meeting lines are not cut off ! I waited in line for around 45 minutes, IN JUNE (so it was soooo hot) with a 2 year old HUGE goofy fan who started fidgeting half way through, got almost to the front of the line and goofy left! That was the absolute worst! You have people who line up with their family (example) take 2 or 3 photos each, then together, then 2 or 3 of them, then different poses, AND THEN muck around with autographs! It is ridiculous! This was one of my worst experiences at the park.There is no cars! Tron isnt all that, the maze is kind of silly since everyone just follows eachother. The lines make it very difficult to get onto a ride, but i guess thats just the way it goes.All in all, the park is amazing. I cannot wait to come back! I would definitely recommend spending the extra on the special tour service they offer for vip treatment"
486,5.0,Jun 2018,"Sydney, Australia ",Exceeded our expectations and fun for the whole family.,"If you are prepared for crowds and long waiting times you will have a fantastic visit to Shanghai Disneyland. Do your research on what rides you prefer to go on and make use of the app. Arrive early in the morning (as soon as the gates open) and head to you top preference rides before the crowds build up. Use of Fast Passes will help speed up the process. The park is spread out and there is lots of walking but very much worth it. Each ride was fun. It can be hot during the day in June but most waiting time was under cover. With light rain in the early evening, the queues reduced around 7pm and we managed to ride on 3 of our preferred rides (Tron, the mine train and jet packs) all within an hour. A great park with a true Disney feel. Can't wait to go back. Wait around for the laser and fireworks show at night."
487,4.0,May 2018,"Fort Worth, TX ","Had Difficulty Giving a Very Good, But Did","We waffled between an Average or Very Good.  We have been to Disneyland Parks (Paris, Orlando, California) since 1974 and were looking forward to Shanghai Disneyland. We read all the TripAdvisor reviews and went on an “off-day.” The cost was approximately $88 USD for two seniors which was a bargain to any Disney Park. We literally walked up the ticket booth and purchased our tickets after waiting in the entrance line for about 30 minutes. Ouch, double ouch as we baked without a bit of shadeFirst, the place is huge, so better have great sneakers or walking shoes. The Fast Passes were long gone. Tron’s wait was 2 ½ hours. So, no Tron. Buzz Light Year was 75 minutes, but I felt great since I was only 50,000 points from 1,000,000 mark. We took in Star Wars which had cool photo ops of all the characters and static displays. Star Wars got us out of the sun and into the AC.Second, even on a “slow day” and thus a reduction in ticket cost, the place was very crowded. And by 1:30 pm was a sea of people.We decided to do Pirates of the Caribbean. Really a fantastic ride, one of Disney’s best in ANY park. But, we waited 2 hours + and saw more twists and turns, pushing and shoving, and we were literally shoulder to shoulder.  We went through the Castile. A real marvel, but that too was crowded. That’s did. We were washed out. Let’s go back to the hotel. Unfortunately, the Parade started and we couldn’t find a cross over. So, we waited and watched the Parade, then walked to the Metro.The best way for me to describe Shanghai Disneyland is like comparing apples to oranges. All the other Parks I can say are like comparing apples to apples, maybe like a Granny to a Macintosh apple. They are apples, but with a slightly different taste. Shanghai Disneyland needs more rides and other venues. I get the idea that this one is different and why, but how can you have a Disneyland without “It’s A Small World?”We have lost count to Disneyworld visits over 4 generations. Gee, I had the pleasure to drop the rope and officially open the park while taking a Disney Leadership Class at Disneyworld. We should make another Shanghai Disneyland visit but will wait a few years until the park matures.In the meantime, we went, we saw, and we have our photos. And for $88 USD for two seniors, the real reason to give a Very Good, but Disney was never about price. The cost value is absolutely there, the overall experiences will need to be improved."
488,1.0,Jun 2018,"Isla de Maipo, Chile",Worst experience,"Worst Disneyland of all. 400 yuan the ticket to get in, 2 hours in queue for every ride. I did a 2:30 queue and when i got to the ride, they had “technical difficulties” and shut down the ride, no compensation. Worst customer service. "
489,5.0,Mar 2018,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates ",Another Satisfied Disney Fan!,"On my quest to collect all Disneyland Parks, Shanghai Disneyland was my penultimate location on my list.  Reviews had me wary about the cleanliness, attitude of the people, etc. and unsure of what to expect.  Overall the experience does not disappoint at all!  Any hesitations were put quickly put to ease as the Disney magic gleamed and sparkled everywhere.  We especially loved the option of online booking of Fastpasses which saved much running across the park while minimizing wait times.  With Shanghai Disney's unique attractions (Namely the largest castle, Tron, and the best version of Pirates of the Caribbean), I consider it a must-do for any Disney fan."
490,5.0,May 2018,"Singapore, Singapore ",Crazily awesome Tron ride,"Go early, leave your hotel/house before 7am to go there, because it is crowded and you really don’t want to be queueing under the hot morning sun early in the morning. We went there on Monday and it was the case. Recommend to download the “Disney Resort” app and bring caps, electric fan, poncho and food (optional). A decent meal inside cost about 80rmb. Use the app to grab the fastpass tickets so you need not queue all the queues.Recommended rides (for adventurers, roller coaster fans only):1. Tron Lightcycle *Best ride i ever taken*2. Roaring rapids (need poncho)3. Pirates of the carribean (cool graphics)4. Seven dwarf trainI didn’t try the Challenge Trials because not enough time, but seems good!8pm is the fireworks, you might want to start camping at 7.30pm with a good seating spot near the fireworks area and have dinner whilst you wait as it gets super crowded. Other tips: - eat a lunch early because 12-3, people crowd the lunch areas and less queue for the rides then. Have a light lunch so as not to puke! - pre-pack light lunch, snack and dinner, water cost about 10rmb per bottle there- have some games to play whilst you queue, prepare portable battery because you might be bored and drain your battery quickly"
491,5.0,Jun 2018,"Christchurch, New Zealand ",Disney through and through!,"I am a big Disney fan and after reading mixed reviews on here I was unsure what to expect. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised to find that this place is indeed a true Disney experience. Cast members are friendly and helpful and work hard to overcome to the language barrier. The sights and sounds are Disney and the rides are top level. Yes, there are some big lines, yes it was hot on some days, yes I saw the odd person selling fake merchandise, but this was rare and no big deal, but NO, I did not find that everyone was cutting lines or that I had to protect my space with my life. What I found in the 5 days we were there is that at times people moved through the line to join their group further up but this wasn't a regular thing.  I experienced this in Disneyland in Anaheim at about the same level and with a party of 7 of us, and did it myself when the need arose on a couple of occasions. No issue, no drama.  The park is very clean and people are friendly. I read a number of Disneyland Shanghai reviews before embarking on my trip and found some information to be lacking so here are the facts as I found them.I booked the Toy Story Hotel on the official site with no problems. As I was looking at a season pass and the information online was lacking re 'wechat' I decided to wait until I got to the hotel to buy my park tickets.I bought one day passes at the hotel and while I was unable to buy the season passes there they explained the process of upgrading at the park. Upgrading was a relatively simple process at guest services with the only issue being that they thought I wanted the Sunday season pass not the Weekday season pass. With help from a supervisor they were able to rectify this. If you want to get a season pass and the discount benefits it brings then you need 'wechat'. It is very big in China and is similar to Viber on steroids as they have evolved it to have so many uses. One of which is the coupons for discount on the season pass. This is a system that is problematic at best. While I did manage to get my discounts each time, it was a bit of a process to do so every time. Wechat is in Chinese so for connecting my passes to the app I got help and then each time I wanted the discount I just handed over my phone for the cast member to do their thing. There is a lot of scanning and clicking and rescanning and getting supervisors help during this process. But with 20% off meals and merchandise, with bonus coupons of 100RMB off for purchases over 300RMB, it was worth doing. I discovered I could only use 5 20% off a day for merchandise, but with 3 passes, that meant 15, so was plenty. The Toy Story Hotel was wonderful and with their early entry we had Toy Story Land to ourselves the first morning so rode Rex's Racer 4 or 5 times in a row, and walked on to Soaring (usually a 2 hour plus wait) the second morning. Overall, it was a fantastic Disney experience, we didn't encounter the issues many people have mentioned on here, save for the long lines on some days, but on others they were fine. It's a big park but it is beautiful and very well themed with some awesome rides. The Tarzan show was spectacular, even though we couldn't understand the language. We found enough food to keep us happy and I was very excited to find a pineapple flavoured ice cream! They didn't call it a Dole Whip but that's pretty much what it was! :-)I Love Disneyland and this place did not disappoint. It was a true Disney experience from which we took many photos, videos and treasured memories! :-)I'm back home in New Zealand now and I miss it!"
492,3.0,Jun 2018,"Miami, FL ",Overcrowded ,"It’s a small park if you compare with Orlando or Anaheim. A lot of people were there on a Friday. Inside, I found people selling fake DISNEY merchandise. Food isn’t good. Fast passes run out as soon as they open the park. Lines were almost up to 240 min. We arrived at 10:30 A.M.. Only we did two lines (45min) one for a ride called Tron, it’s awesome, and the other line was for a ride inside Toy Story World. Because of the crowed, after 1pm all the others lines for the best rides were between 120 to 240 min. We left the park around 3pm because of the people and also we live in Florida an we usually go to Orlando."
493,2.0,Jun 2018,"Kailua-Kona, HI ",Horrible visit,"Let me first say that I absolutely LOVE Disneyland. I've been to LA, Orlando, Tokyo, and now Shanghai.I can't believe I'm saying this but I do not recommend this park. The crowds are totally insane. Fast passes run out immediately after the park opens and you need to wait in a very long line for security to get into the park. They do not allow any food at all and people push, shove, stomp on you, and cut in line. I was coughed on, sneezed on, saw kids peeing on the sidewalks, people were spitting and littering everywhere. I even had a guy burp in my face. If you let even one inch space between the person in front of you, the people will try to cut in front of you from behind. If you can afford the AP fast pass, I believe it's around $500 USD for a family of 4 do it. The rides will blow your mind! The rides are totally fantastic but if you didn't get a fast pass, be prepared to wait 235 minutes. I've never seen anything like it. The fast pass system doesn't make sense. You get 3 rides with a fast pass, but you cannot obtain any fast passes unless you are the first ones to enter the park and want to literally fight people on the way in. I'm so sad to write this review because I love Disney, but we had a terrible experience."
494,3.0,May 2018,Malaysia ,My First Disneyland,"Since I was in Shanghai on a group tour, I chose the option of visiting Disneyland rather than shopping.  After few days traveling and visiting Hangzhou and Mount Huangshan, I was tire and thought Disneyland was just a fun place to hangout.Everything has been arranged and we took our tour bus to Disneyland.  The ride was about an hour from our hotel. The bus dropped us at the bus park and we have to walk about 10 minutes to the entrance gate (open air).  At the security gate, all personal belongings were checked and they went through my handbag.  I brought a packet of snack which was confiscated but my sweets and energy bar were spared.  They only allow limitedl titbits and one bottle of water unopened.  If you have children, they will allow some small snacks.The weather was bit cloudy but got hotter as the day went by.  It was Tuesday and there were large crowds.We arrived at the gate and was excited to see the garden with landscape of Minnie's face.  I saw Disneyland staff standing on strategic spot to capture photos for visitors.  Unsure if needed to pay.I escaped into the souvenir shops enjoying the air condition. Not planning to buy anything, just browse through their displays.Children were the most excited and happy lot.  Some dressed in disneyland characters' clothings and they really looked cute and adorable.  Adults were seen putting on hairband depicting minnie mouse' ears. Lots of stalls selling drinks, souvenir items, snacks and balloons.  The whole place was alive and disneyland music was blarring in the background. One stall didnt accept cash when I wanted a bottle of cold drink.  I have to buy one from a shop.From a distance I could see the castle, majestically stood out waiting for all to visit. Lots of flowers on plots for gardens sprawled all over the land. I walked into Adventure Isle and saw mini waterfalls, people cannoying in the water around the Isle.  There was also round water boat that goes through water volcano or water obstacles. Groups of families were bustling to and fro.  Restaurants and eateries were doing a roaring business.I decided not to go for any rides after seeing all the long ques.  When the parade was over, I went into the castle and it was the coolest and the best place to hide away from the heat.  There were many people crowding in the castle.  There were eateries and souvenir shops too.It was about 37 deg C.  Earlier stopped by to buy a mickey mouse shape ice cream (RMB40.00).  Infact, there was water dispenser outside one of the toilet area. How convenient. They are some giant umbrella shades or big trees and seating areas but they were mostly occupied.After walking around decided to leave by 2pm and not wait for the fire works at night.  The heat was unbearable and I took a taxi back to our hotel (RMB 140.00).  The walk from the exit of Disneyland to taxi station was quite a distance and no sheds nor covered walk way.  I was practically roasted tho had a cap over my head.Later came to know from my tour group members, that one can purchase fast track tickets and reduced the waiting time for rides at Disneyland.  The disadvantage was the Disneyland brochure was in Mandarin and I did not have wifi access.  So unable to download some useful apps to enjoy some of the benefits.  Anyway, I was already tire after few days of travelling and the heat made my visit unbearable.However, I was happy I could step foot into Disneyland at a not so young age.  Glad to just experience the world of Disneyland, to feel the ambiance and cartoon-like surrounding with excited noisy children."
495,5.0,May 2018,N/A,Great teams of Concierge at Toy Story Hotel and Guest services at Disneyland,"I would like to take this opportunity to give my deepest appreciation to your fantastic and warmest greetings from your Front office and Concierge teams !During my last and first visit to your hotel on 26 May, as it was the first time return trip for my mom who age 80 back to Shanghai, we were so welcomed with those happy faces and warm smiles from your cast members since we stepped into your hotel from the entrance to the front desk counter.  Especially , Alessandro from Concierge team and Amos from Front office team, they escorted us to the room and with very details explanation about the hotel and park facilities.Throughout the stay, Alessandro always assisted us with our inquiries with his sincere and professional approach.On my departure day on 27 May, Alessandro and his colleagues, David & Roger had assisted us for transportation to the town and gave my mom many advices about the places in Shanghai.  She was very impressed about their kindness.Even a very short visit for us, this was a very memorable trip for my mom and myself, I deeply appreciated to thank you your cast members who made this happened!!  they are the most valuable assets to your hotel who can carry out the magic moments to all guests in the future!!In Disneyland, guest services staff were very helpful and cheerful, my mom at age 80 was very enjoyable to be there on 26 & 27 May 2018."
496,2.0,Jun 2018,N/A,Overrated and over-crowded,We went on a Monday to avoid the crowds.  However the park was still overcrowded. The park itself is quite small and the rides were over 2 hours waiting. We queued for 160 minutes for 1 ride and promptly gave up trying again. Afterwards we couldn’t find a place to sit and eat. There are much more interesting places to go in Shanghai instead of here. If this is going to be your first chance of experiencing a Disney Land then I suggest going elsewhere. All in all not worth the entry ticket price.
497,4.0,May 2018,"Durban, South Africa ",A wonderful experience! ,"Shanghai Disney was a great experience, despite the glaring language barrier. All shows and attractions are in Mandarin, but there are English translations on all the signboards and the staff do their best to communicate with international travellers.The park is easily accessible by metro. We arrived around 10am on an overcast Saturday, and managed to miss most of the long queues at the entrance. However, by this time, many of the fastpasses were finished and the queues for rides were 45 mins to 2 hours long. Unfortunately we didn't get to go on all the rides or see all the shows, but Tron was certainly a highlight. The Tarzan show also exceeded expectations and is a must for anyone who enjoys acrobatics. Plan a 2 day trip if you have the means and want to experience everything the park has to offer. The parade was absolutely wonderful and the cast members paid extra attention to us, as we were rather outstanding as foreigners. It is definitely worth staying till closing time and catching the fireworks show. Purchase your souvenirs along the way, wherever possible, as the main store near the entrance is incredibly crowded in the evening and you may become delayed for the fireworks show. Stay for dinner after, as you'll miss the rush on the metro. Be careful not to stay too late as the last train leaves around 10.30pm. Leave earlier than this if you have connecting trains as many stations run their last train at 11pm.The food within the park leaves much to be desired. We struggled to find food without pork, and the taste was perfectly average for such high prices. Stargazer has the worst burgers we've ever had. We ate at Blue Frog, just outside the main section of the park, for dinner and the food was phenomenal! The best burger I had had during my two weeks in China. They have a selection of steaks and chicken dishes as well.The ticket booth and stores accept cash as well as all major international credit cards. "
498,4.0,May 2018,"Singapore, Singapore ",Nice but too crowded,"The park is huge, and was very crowded. Most of the rides have long waiting time. The tron ride would give you an adrenaline rush! The Pirates of the Caribbean ride is enjoyable and amazing! but be careful when you sit at the last row, you might get splashed by water. Food comes in quite a large portion, so if you are not that hungry, two person can share one set."
499,5.0,Jun 2018,"Singapore, Singapore ",Superb Experience,"Bought a 2-day pass and managed to go for all the rides with Fastpasses. Crowd was small on the Thursday (probably also due to the rain), but Friday was very crowded. Clearing security and ticket counters were quite difficult with a 7-year-old, but after that everything was very good. There isn’t a need to go for Premier Access as the queues were manageable - save the money for souvenirs and meals."
500,3.0,Jun 2018,"Panjim, India ",Same experience but too crowded,"This place does not have many new rides and attractions and even on weekdays, the crowd is huge. We had to wait for upto 2 hours for some rides and the fast pass was enormously expensive.I would not recommend it to someone who has already been to Disney land at some other place. "
501,5.0,May 2018,"Brisbane, Australia ",Stunning Place,Disneyland is beautiful it was exactly as you would imagine somewhere created by Disney and let would be. All the buildings with themed as well as the restaurants some of the lines for the restaurants we're similar to the hours you waited in line for a ride. We went on the Pirates of the Caribbean comma the Snow White seven dwarfs rideand then Tron they are all amazing would have gone on the Tron several times more.We waited two hours that was pretty difficult and there was no more fast passes left. We would have gone on more rides more times that we have bought the fastpass when we booked out tickets definitely the way to go. The park was full but it was still easy to get around without feeling like there were tons of people in your space. We left the 4th for the fireworks to avoid the traffic on the trains I think that was the way to go. Definitely buy your ticket when you get to the station on your way there cause the machines fill up like crazy at the end of the show.
502,5.0,May 2018,Victoria B.C ,Amazing Disney Park - Worth the 10+ hour flight!,"Shanghai Disneyland is such a cool park; authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese rings true. With SHDL, everything is purpose-built which is really nice. They've learned from their 60+ years of theme park experience, and have applied all of their best practices here. Everything looks and feels brand new. In my opinion it has the 2 best rides in the entire Disney empire, Prates of the Caribbean: Battle for Sunken Treasure, and Tron, are reason alone to fly across the world to experience this park. And the nighttime spectacular is out of this world (the fireworks take on a secondary role to all of the projections and the music). It truly is an incredible experience.The resort has the luxury of size - huge walkways so there is less crowding and congestion, and there are picnic areas located throughout the park that can easily serve as expansion areas down the road. So much potential here. It's huge... the entire resort area (988 acres), is roughly 3 times the size of the Hong Kong resort, over 3 times the size of Epcot (300 acres) and is over 11 times the size of the original Disneyland Park in California (85 acres).Number of days / Timing:The entire park can been seen in 2 full days with the help of the Premium Fastpass. We spent 2 full days, and 2 mornings, and feel like we saw most things. We didn’t watch any of the shows (Pirates, Tarzan, Frozen sing-along, etc) and instead rode Pirates (6 times) and Tron (3 times). We took our time, tried lots of different foods, did lots of shopping, and tried our best to relax and not wait in long lines.We chose to go in late May, after the national holiday in early May, and before the school summer vacations in June. I think we timed it right, because the weather was perfect (warm but not too hot/humid), the pollution was low, the park was not too busy, and had extended hours of 8am - 8:30pm.Suggest you combine SHDL with a trip to Tokyo Disneyland and Disney Sea (more unique and drastically different than other parks), and Hong Kong (a smaller and more intimate version of Disneyland). Suggest 2-3 days at SHDL, 3-4 days at TDL/DS, and 1-2 days at HKDL (combined with Ocean Park - a really cool seaside park that combines Sea World (but with pandas) and an amusement park).Apps: Download the official Shanghai Disneyland App, as well as the Shanghai specific Photopass app (from the China Photopass website – in Mandarin) before you go. For some reason, the main app only worked on one of our two phones. Purchase a SIM card in advance (we got ours for $40 on Amazon). If you have trouble creating an account, wait until you get into the park and connect to the park’s wifi. You can also ask at Guest Services just inside the park entrance for assistance.Premium Fastpass & Attractions: So worth it if you can afford it. Upon entering the park, you can purchase the premium fastpass on your app – it takes less than 2 minutes, and our Canadian Visa card worked no problem. You get an open-ended fastpass for all of the rides that have fastpass, as well as pirates! You can also buy them for individual attractions (for $10-$20 per ride depending on how busy the park is – not sure if they are offered for sale later in the day though). The single rider lines were only open some of the time.Pirates was breathtaking! My jaw is still on the floor. I won’t go into detail, but it is the best attraction Disney has ever built. Recommend that you sit in the front so as to not see other people on their phones/taking pictures, but also ride it from the back to get the full perspective. This ride is worth the trip to Asia.And Tron… so good! For Tron, you can take a bag/backback onto the ride – they have a cool bin system where your bag will be waiting for you when you get off the ride. No need to buy a locker (I think it was about $10 USD for a locker anyways!).The Voyage attraction didn’t open until 11am, and we mistakenly went on it around 11:30 with a 30 minute wait. If we had of waited until later in the afternoon (3pm), it had only a 10 min wait. It's like a combination of Storybook Land Canal Boats and the Jungle Cruise.Meet Mickey – a cool and easy place to meet Mickey. Went in the early morning and walked right in! The photopass people do a great job – I think they took in excess of 30 photos!Toy Story Land is the hot new area of the park. Suggest you go at opening or face long lines of 45+ min by mid-morning.If you’ve already been on Soarin’ in the states, don’t waste your time with their version (identical, apart from a different ending scene – not worth the wait) or Roaring Rapids, I’d say less exciting than Grizzly River Run or Kali River Rapids. The wait time for Pirates averaged 15-30 minutes, and Tron ranged from 10-45 min. Do those… multiple times…Dining & Fireworks:Lots of quick service options, just not much before 11am (essentially only Remy’s patisserie on Mickey Ave is open, not even any of the carts - but there is a Starbucks in Disney Town). The Toy Box Café in Toy Story Land was great and had lots of options (essentially a bunch of different food windows) – it opened at 10:30am. Had Sichuan fried chicken nachos from the Mrs. Pototo Head stand… so good! Pizza was okay, alien shaped which was cool, but the taste was meh. We also ate at the Stargazer Grill in Tomorrowland twice out of convenience (good AC, lots of seats, and located near Tron). Had the spicy chicken burger – really liked it. Beef burger was okay. Didn’t try the fried chicken, but it looked good.Also, you can’t find much about it online, but the park has DOLE WHIP! It’s located at Fairy Godmother’s Cupboard in Fantasyland, and I believe Spiral Snacks in Tomorrowland. It’s called Stitch’s Frozen Pineapple Cone, but it tastes identical to Dole Whip. But beware of sporadic hours (I think it was only open from 11am-3pm).Another thing unique to the park is seafood “churros” from the Snackin’ Kracken – essentially strips of seafood battered and fried. Barbossa’s Bounty is a neat quick service style restaurant with a cool dining area looking into the ride (like Blue Bayou at Disneyland). Food was okay, and rather expensive. Had the chicken and rice, and the ribs and rice. No salted popcorn in the park, only caramel popcorn.We had dinner at Royal Banquet Hall (in the castle), which was ho hum. It was comparable to other character dining experiences, food not amazing, but not bad, and the time with each character was brief. BUT, they have the option of adding on special fireworks viewing for 200 RMB per person. This was certainly one of the highlights of the trip. You meet back at the castle between 7:15-7:30pm, and from there you walk to a reserved section below the castle. On our night (a Tuesday) it was us and maybe 15 other people in an area that could probably accommodate 1000 people. It was incredible. Best “seat” in the house. You could either sit on the ground or stand. But the view from here was amazing… life changing. We had seen the fireworks on an earlier night from father back on Mickey Ave, and missed so much of the show. From here you see and feel everything. Especially with all of the projections, you need a full view up close. If you do one thing during your trip, DO THIS! I think it may be the best fireworks/projection show in the Disney empire. Better than Wishes or Fantasmic, combined.Stay on site: we stayed at the Toy Story hotel – highly recommend you stay on site. In the morning the bus drops you off directly at the Disney Town entrance to the park, easily saves you waiting in line – one day we were let into the park 30 minutes before opening! We heard that the line at front of the park took some people almost 2 hours just to get in. No joke. The Toy Story hotel also had an amazing cafeteria-style buffet breakfast. I think it cost around $25 USD per person, but so so worth it if you’re hungry. They had western staples such as Mickey waffles, pancakes, hashbrowns, etc, but also lots of eastern dishes – great dumplings… some of the best of our trip. I probably had 10 for breakfast. The bus to the park runs every 10 minutes, and the first one of the day is at 7:10. If you want to make the first bus, you need to be in line by 6:50. One morning we lined up at 7 and missed the first bus, but a second bus came right after it. So they are frequent.Merchandise: Take advantage of package delivery to your hotel. I believe if you purchase by 4pm, it will be delivered to your hotel gift shop by 9pm that night. Beware that they won’t ship food items (such as tins of food), or certain things of value, such as limited edition pins. The World of Disney at Disney Town is the store of stores. We found everything at this one location. In hindsight, we wish we would have just done all of our shopping here. Didn’t find anything that was specific/special to a certain location in the park.Tickets: If you are a hotel guest, there are no black out days and you can buy tickets on arrival. We purchased a season pass equivalent to 3 days of park admission, and with that it gave us 20% off merchandise, 20% off dining, and a bunch of other quick service, merchandise, and photopass coupons. Season passes can only be purchased at the front gate, so we went the night before we intended to use them to skip the inevitable long line that would be there in the morning. Otherwise, regular tickets can be purchased at the concierge desk of the hotel. Photopass: A one-day photopass was only $199 RMB which we thought was a great deal considering it includes on-ride photos. With the season pass, they also have a 60 RMB discount coupon. We used one photopass card for the entire trip, and linked it to the app. Could view our pictures instantly. We also were able to use the Chinese photopass website (in English) to download our photos after we got back home to Canada.Arriving at the airport:Walk outside to the taxi stand. Have printed directions that show the hotel name in Mandarin. We did, but our driver still had to ask (there's a stand that he could pull over to before exiting the airport). After that, no issue. He dropped us off at the front door of the hotel.Other notes:- I’d say 90% of people enter the park and head for either Soarin’ or Toy Story Land. If you don’t care about Soarin’, suggest you start in Tomorrowland and work your way around the park clockwise.- Disney Store downtown Shanghai – don’t bother. Spend your time at the World of Disney at Disney Town instead. Much bigger and more of a selection.- English - we found that several of the cast members didn’t speak much English, but they always could find someone nearby who could assist. Also, most of the supervisors speak English (ticket office, concierge desk, guest services, etc. No issue, and everyone we encountered was friendly. For ordering food, they have printed menus that you could easily point to- Every bathroom had a western toilet – usually the last one of the row.- Ponchos and umbrellas are readily available out of every gift shop. No real need to bring one from home.- Apparently “locals” don’t like high speed rides – they’ve been increasing the speed of Tron recently, and it has scared away the crowds which is awesome- When it’s sunny, or raining, people rush to line up. The wait time for the major rides will go through the roof, including other attractions with interior queues, such as Meet Mickey. This is the best time to shop or eat. There is no reason you should wait more than 30 minutes for a ride if you’re smart about things, go for opening, and take advantage of fastpass.- We took a break the first day, and think it may have been a mistake. You have to walk a long distance from the bus to the entrance/exit (like 15 minutes – it’s a long slog), then wait for the bus, take the bus, walk to the room, etc. It’s essentially 45+ minutes each way on your feet, so it’s only worth it if you’re taking a significant break. Not worth the effort for a 1 or 2 hour break.- We didn’t feel the need to explore or eat at Disney Town. There was plenty of selection in the park for everyone.- The Beauty and the Beast Broadway show started on May 18th – didn’t see anything about that before our trip. We only happened to see the poster in Disney Town."
503,5.0,Apr 2018,N/A,A memorable visit!,"Went to Disneyland on 18 Apr (Wednesday) - 3 adults. We woke up late that day and left our hotel around 1:15. Took the subway and reached Disney around 2. There was almost no waiting line at the entrance and we entered within 10-15 min. Just as we entered, people were lining up to take view of a roadshow that was about to start. We counted ourselves lucky to be there on time and witnessed a wonderful parade. After that we went to TRON. Though the flasher was indicating a 90min waiting line, we were through in around 50min. Then we went to the Pirates (Battle for the sunken treasure). There the waiting was around 80min. By then it was already around 7 but we still managed to go to Seven Dwarfs (80min waiting line). We also viewed the fireworks when we were leaving.I would rate it a very good trip considering our very late arrival to the park. Just a few things that would be helpful for others:1. Prioritize your attractions - Not every attraction is worth the waiting line2. Try to fetch a location map from a counter - The place is not very helpful in terms of directions"
504,5.0,May 2018,Calgary ,Shanghai Disneyland,"Went to Disneyland May 2nd - there were 5 adults and we all wanted to stay together.  Line up to get into the park was very long - approx. 1 hour wait.  Once we got in we had to go to Customer Relations to show our passports because we booked online.  Was fairly easy to get through and we were in the park!  It is absolutely beautiful and so clean.  The lineups for the rides were extremely long, I had the Disneyland app so I got us all VIP access to rides as we wanted them.  They are approx. 16.00 CDN for each ride but well worth it as we could get on the ride within 5-10 minutes as opposed to 1-2 hour wait - well worth it in my opinion.  We did soaring over the horizon (my favorite) soaring rapids, pirates of the Caribbean and the seven dwarfs roller coaster (fun fun) and a  Peter Pan one.  The colors and flowers and staff were all amazing.  I truly enjoyed my Shanghai Disneyland experience even though it was a bit more money to go VIP on the rides - but it was worth every penny not to stand in the lineup in the 30 deg C heat for 1-2 hours.

505,5.0,Oct 2017,"Toronto, Canada ",One of my favourite Disney,"I been to Paris, HK, LA, Orlando Disney, and this Shanghai one is beautiful and clean! Very crowded because it is so new, but same as all other Disney! Staffs are friendly and lots of new rides! I suggest to go early and do homework what you want to do and line up there first! Great firework too!"
506,4.0,May 2018,"Los Angeles, CA ",A HUGE park and crowded,We went on their Labor Day Holiday break and it was extremely crowded for a Monday.  Tuesday the park was nearly empty but we purchased the fast pass option that allows you visit all the rides at least once with this option.   The Pirate ride is amazing and the Soaring ride is almost the same as the one in Anaheim.   The food options is expensive for the locals so lines were short.   We stayed at the Toy Story Hotel and they have separate entrance to the park plus the breakfast buffet was fantastic at the hotel.
507,4.0,May 2018,"Melbourne, Australia ",Last day in China,What a way to end a holiday.  Disney in Chinese.  Was beautiful colourful and all DISNEY. Only let down was the quality of the food available.  Very pricey not very tasty.  Very very clean and staff very helpful
508,4.0,Apr 2018,N/A,Very enjoyable experience,"The last time I went to a Disney Theme park was 20 years ago. So, this time I decided to bring my 9-year old son to Shanghai Disneyland since it's the newest. Disneyland still has the magic, and what a fun day it was! Some tips:1) avoid long weekends where the locals will come out in drove. Bear in mind, the target market of 300 mil people lives within 3 hours from Shanghai Disneyland. We made the mistake of going to Shanghai during the Labour holiday weekend. The lines for the popular rides like Soaring Over the Horizon, Rolling Rapids were 3-hour long, Tron 2.5hours ++2) buy your tickets on-line. I used the Klook app and the tickets were slightly cheaper. Printed out and showed it to the ticket counter where they will print out the actual tickets and take your photos. Foreigners need to show your passport (those who bought the tix on-line)3) download the Shanghai Disney app for the FastPass. Unfortunately, I could not sign up as the message stated ""A word you entered cannot be accepted by our system; please enter a different word"". Until today, don't know why. But the rest of my group mates could sign up. The app was also a great help to check for the show times as well as the waiting line for the different rides.4) arrive early so that you can download the free FastPass. By the time we went in, all the FastPass for the good rides were gone. Ended buying 1 FastPass because I didn't want my son to miss the Soaring Over the Horizon - 15 mins wait vs 3-hour wait.5) Yes, saw a few people selling fake Disney gifts which was weird as they do it quite blatantly6) If you want churros etc, they sell them near the castle area7) For Muslims, can ask the Guest Office as you enter the park if you could use one of the private rooms for your prayers. The rooms are clean.8) Loved the lights and fireworks show at night. It's different. It's beautiful. The day we went, they had 2 shows, just awesome!9) You'll still enjoy the place even if you don't understand Mandarin10) Ride the Tron after the first fireworks show, the line will be shorter.11) The park tickets are cheaper compared to other Disney theme parks. Food is expensive though, as expected.We were told by our tour guide that they allow us to bring in one 600-ml mineral water for each pax. No food allowed.Hope the info above will help you plan your visit to Shanghai Disneyland."
509,4.0,Dec 2017,"Mexico City, Mexico ",Disney magic meets chinese culture,"- The first thing we saw when we were about to enter, was a guy offering us tickets (we don't know if they were fake) to enter. It was weird because we were in front of the cast members who sell the official tickets, and they did nothing about it.- People inside the park take more fast passes than they need and sell them; which is obviously against the rules, and should be punished because it´s unfair, since we all pay the same price for the entrance. They also sell pirate merchandise inside the park.- There are rides and merchandise that only exist in this park, which is super cool, because it makes it different. Personally, I'm a big fan of ""Zootopia"", but in Orlando the merchandise for this movie is technically un-existant (they only have pins), while, here in Shanghai there was a store that was mainly filled with related merchandise. That made me happy.- The shows are great (the pirate show and the Tarzan spectacular have awesome special effects and acrobatics), but you must take into consideration that they are all in Chinese (which makes sense because you are in China), but they are still easy to understand and very fun.- You must take advantage of the single rider pass in Tron and Pirates of the Caribbean (although in Tron you need to ask for a ticket to get into that line).- There are not many snacks, and they don't have the traditional Disney pretzels.- We went on a rainy Thursday, when Chinese people didn't have vacations yet, so the park was not so full, which was super convenient, and made the experience better.- The staff doesn't always speak English.- There was one cast member in particular who helped us a lot and offered to register her Chinese telephone number so we could have internet access, in order to use the Disney app (which works just like the one for the other parks), and helps you see the location and the waiting times for the rides, the parades, the shows and the character encounters.- It is cheaper than the rest of the Disney parks."
510,5.0,May 2018,"Houston, TX ",Season Pass!!!,"The season pass pretty much pay for itself after three visits. The park itself is an alright size but the lines are way too long even for a Wednesday. Obviously the park food sucks but on the far left side of the entrance there is a “Disneytown” it has a Cheesecake Factory, a few noodle (ramen/udon) places, and some Chinese food (rice, dumping, etc.) You also can get to the town from inside the park."
511,4.0,Apr 2018,N/A,Another magical disneyland,Prepare as you will see lots of crowds all year long -it is China with 1.3billions citizen.ShanghaiDisney app may come in handy to take or check fastpass distribution status. And it all out by 10am. After that you need to queue for more than 1h especially for Tron and Soaring.
512,3.0,May 2018,Vietnam ,"My, my, my Shanghai","Beautiful gardens with the most gorgeous flowersPlenty of spaces to sit, rest & eatThe queues for the rides are long, we waited almost 2hours for The Tron. Was it worth it? Yes, but it was over in a couple of minutes. The food was delicious esp the popcorn, but very expensive. Pirates of the Carribean was a highlight, very well done.Although there were lots of people, I mean tonnes of people after entry it felt less kaotic. Toy Story parade was so well done & captivating. Although very different to Anaheim, it was still just as exciting.Fast passes run out quick & they're limited so get them using the app. The pushing in game is real, so push in, push back & don't look back!"
513,4.0,May 2018,"Kuranda, Australia ",An experience,Fastpass is a must here. Huge crowds even on a weekday. A passport is needed on entry for foreigners for id. Recommend downloading the disney app before you go.( no google allowed in china). The park is huge and lots of entertainment for all ages. Most of the shows are only in chinese.  Lots of food choices for anyone.
514,5.0,Apr 2018,"Manchester, UK, ",Simply Magical.,"When i found out that they was building a Shanghai Disneyland i wanted to go straight away. A year or so after opening i was finally there. I couldn't believe it. The queues and the amount of people are very overwhelming but if done right it can be an amazing day as it was for me and a few friends. We did visit on a Saturday in April just before the Bank holiday in China so i knew it was going to be extremely busy. We got the metro from Shanghai to the Park it takes around an hour and its very easy to get to. We arrived to the Park around 8am and the there was already hundreds of people entering the park. We finally got in at around 8:30am and we got our fast pas for Tron, this was one of the only rides left available and this was for the evening. We went first to the Pirates of the Caribbean ride and there was a queue time of 80 minutes. I had the Disney Shanghai app on my phone to keep checking the queue times on other attractions and most rides were at least 180 minutes for the big attractions. The Pirates ride was absolutely amazing! The effects they use are unreal! We came out and toured the park a little then watched Mickeys Storybook Express which is a fun parade full of Disney characters though just before the parade there is a lot of pushing from other guests trying to get a good view. We then went for Dinner, they have numerous restaurants in the park but we choose to eat Chinese food which was really nice. We then went to the Roaring Rapids with a queue time of 180 minutes but it was more 120 minutes by the time we got on it and again another fun ride. We then went to see Mickey Mouse he's based in a small attraction but the queue was only 30 minutes and you get to take some awesome photos. We then walked around the park a little and waited for our time slot for Tron the ride- This was by far the most amazing theme park i have ever been on, the theming of the ride and the ride itself is out of this world! You must ride it at night though! Simply amazing!Due to the park being so busy the day we went, they decided to do two performances of Ignite the Dream, if the schedule has two performances i would recommend to stay for the second one as the crowds are not as busy. I can honestly say that i have never seen anything like it. the whole show is unreal its so magical! The best night time show i have seen in any Disney park. I absolutely loved Shanghai Disneyland. I have been to every Disney in the world apart from Tokyo. Its by far the most beautiful park i have been too and the Castle is spectacular and HUGE! I do wish i got to go on the other attractions and that i had more time to see a show but just prepare yourselves for the crowds and you will be fine! Have a magical time!"
515,5.0,Apr 2018,"Singapore, Singapore ",The shows are amazing ,Shanghai Disney probably has the best shows by far among the resorts I have been to. Most of the shows are in both either Mandarin or English. I really love their shows as they were well planned and they incorporate gymnast and circus in their show which make it really amazing. I am once again a child in the resort. 
516,3.0,May 2018,"Orange, CA ",Beware of the Crowds!,"If you’re like me and you want to see all the Disneyland’s in the world then this is definitely a must see. However there are some things you should know ahead of time. I went on a Monday when it was raining and I arrived 30 minutes before they opened. It was already a mob scene! Remember that the Chinese do not cue orderly so they do everything possible to jump ahead. The point I’m making is make sure you get there before the park opens. I would get there an hour earlier if you can. Not only is there a line but you will have to walk quite a bit from the parking lot to the front gate. They do not have trolleys like they do in America.Fast pass is a nice idea in theory but in actuality the park opened at 8 and fast pass was over by 9:30. Again I went on a rainy Monday. It’s a beautiful new park with some cool different rides. I enjoyed the Pirates of the Caribbean as well as Winnie the Pooh’s honey hunt. Towards the middle of the day the lines were up to three hours to wait for rides and quite long for food too. This park is just too small for the area and not enough rides. Of the rides they do have they don’t have enough of the boats, carts, etc to accommodate larger crowds. God bless the Chinese for being so patient and willing to wait 2 and 3 hours. I think this park would be making major changes if it were in America. Take your own food and drink. That will save some time. The sign says no food but nobody listens and when they inspect they don’t take anything away. Be patient and flexible and know what you’re getting into beforehand and you should have fun."
517,5.0,Apr 2018,"Mountain View, CA ",Come Prepared and Buy Premier Access or Suffer the Consequences,"My son and I are hardcore Disney theme park fans. We have been to all the Disney parks worldwide (Anaheim, Orlando, Paris, Shanghai, Tokyo) except Hong Kong. We were apprehensive about visiting, given the negative publicity around huge crowds, long lines, and cultural differences (pushing, queue cutting, spitting, public urination/defecation), but were ready to accept them as we were eager to experience the latest and biggest Disney park. Buy your tickets online in advance through Klook.com and arrive early (7:30am). Avoid weekends if possible! Download the Shanghai Disneyland app for your smartphone. You will need the app to buy Disney Premier Access (600 RMB, US$95) as soon as you are admitted to the park. Premier Access gives you 7 FastPass tickets which you can use at any time. You absolutely should do this, because FastPass tickets sell out early. It is worth the 600 RMB; otherwise, you will be standing in queues that can be as long as 2 hours.Although we did experience large crowds, attempted line-cutting and some pushing, overall they did not distract from the two highlights of the park, the Tron and Pirates of the Carribean attractions. Read about these attractions online and see the YouTube videos about them. I won't repeat their descriptions.  Both attractions warrant the praises bestowed on them; they were both exceptional and consistent with the entertainment experience you expect from Disney."
518,4.0,Apr 2018,"Basingstoke, UK ",extremely crowded,"We were only in Shanghai on the Sunday so disneyland was very crowded and up to three hour queues for the rides. All the fast passes were gone.The midday parade was very good, the shows are mainly acrobatic based so not as good as the usa ones, but different. A long walk from where the taxis drop of and pick up.A good day ot as always but dont go at the weekend."
519,5.0,Mar 2018,"Las Vegas, NV ",Every Disney fans dream!,"This place is amazing!  The colors, rides, and complete uniqueness make it a ""must-see"" for any Disney fan.  The castle draws your attention immediately upon entering.  The rides are unique to this park, which makes it special.  The only thing that was disappointing was the sheer amount of people in the park.  The wait times for all the rides were so high we had to purchase the Disney Premier Access (which gives you a FastPass for eight of the more popular rides) on our second day at the park.  If we had not purchased this pass, we would not have been able to ride any of the most popular rides.  Visiting this park was truly a bucket list item and I will be back again!"
520,3.0,Apr 2018,Singapore ,Touting good time... in the happiest place on earth,"Prior to going to Shanghai Disneyland our Shanghainese friends advised us to book our tickets online, make sure we get there at 7am to queue to get in first when the gates open at 10am. With a toddler in tow, there was no way we were going to stand in line three hours before the park even opens. So we decided that we would reach at 10am, assess the queue/crowd situation before deciding on whether or not to even enter the park.On the way there, the subway was considered empty for Shanghai, which we felt was a good sign. There was a tout onboard selling Minnie Mouse hairbands and rain coats for the ""wet"" rides... not sure that this merchant or merchandise is endorsed by Disney...Upon arrival at Disneyland, we were pleasantly surprised that there was a short queue entering the park for the security check (less than 10 pax infront of me). So we proceeded to buy the tickets. There my group was persistently harassed by a tout who insisted that we purchased tickets from her as she would give us a discount. She even offered to give us the tickets for RMB50 first and to collect the rest of the money only after we successfully entered the park and she wanted one of our passports (we were a group of 6 adults and 1 child). When we declined her, she got more aggressive and raised her voice at us and followed us all the way to the ticketing window and only disappeared after we ordered the tickets from the counter. Once more, is this endorsed by Disney? Why were there no security there to discourage this type of behaviour? After we entered the park, we were greeted by Fast Pass touts who tried to sell us their Fast Pass. We tried to get our Fast Pass from the machines only to realise that it is all finished for the day. This is at 10.30am, 30 mins after park opening. Throughout the day, we were consistently harassed by Fast Pass touts. Is Disney now selling their Fast Pass? As we queued for our rides, there were touts going down the line selling princess key chains and Minnie Mouse hair bands.... are these ""merchants"" and merchandise Disney approved? In addition to this, people were smoking non-stop in the queues which made it unbearable especially for rides that had more enclosed queuing areas. AND of course the cigarette butts were just littered where the smoker was queuing. Truly magical. Plus the queue ""cutting"", pushing and shoving to get into theatres for shows - I felt like I was part of the pre-show, perhaps a war scene in Pirates of the Carribean. The queues at the rides were not unbearably long, it was reasonable. The rides were good. Even the toilets were cleaner than Universal Studios Singapore - at least there were no smell. The theme park food was even good, based on what I had (braised pork with rice and braised lamb with rice)...BUT the touts spoiled the magical feeling and I feared for our safety at some point, and through no fault of Disneyland - not to mention the inconsiderate smokers and other unsavoury behaviour would make me think twice about returning or recommending it.   Last but not least, we went at 10.30am on a Friday morning leading up to the Labour Day holiday. There is no need to queue for three hours prior to opening."
521,4.0,Mar 2018,Malta ,Plan ahead,"Avoid weekends and holidays. Plan ahead and buy tickets beforehand by downloading the app... get there in the morning and head straight to Tron Lightcycle (we only waited for like 15 minutes, compared to others who waited 2 to 3 hours), then to Soaring Over the Horizon. These are the two most popular rides. Take some cardigan with you - the place is huge and less built than the city, so it felt chillier than the city centre."
522,3.0,Jul 2017,"Durban, South Africa ",Give it time,"Disneyland is the happiest place on earth right? Well not at shanghai Disney. The staff are not trained adequately and besides waiting sometimes more than 3 hours in the line for 1 ride, it takes what feels like forever to finally get on and takes even longer to get off.the staff are highly inefficient when it comes to getting people on the ride and off the ride which is why the extremely long waits. I do hope the staff learn and become quicker because its really boring when it takes longer to sit on a ride waiting to jump off than the ride itself. A lot of time is wastedOther than the lack of training, Shanghai Disney has the potential to be out of this world amazing... for now its just okayP.S  the app is very helpful so make sure to download it"
523,5.0,Oct 2017,East Scotland ,Third Disney Park for us,"This park is huge!We arrived by taxi & the walk from the drop off area was really long. There wasn't much queues for tickets & we were soon in the park. The weather wasn't on our side but it didn't dampen our spirits!The park never felt crowded & there are lots of rides.The castle is huge & the kids met a lot of characters.Not being Chinese speakers meant a couple of things were off limits to us, but not so much that it would impact your day.The parade is the best I've seen.We left via train, this is so well set up and a lot cheaper than a taxi. Loved this park."
524,1.0,Apr 2018,"Canberra, Australia ",The crowds were insane,"This park has so many major operational flaws.  There are not enough rides and shows to accommodate the massive crowds they are dealing with.  The whole thing from the beginning was a debacle.  I'm a huge disney fan and have been to WDW, DL and DLP.  I went in with good expectations for this brand new park only to be disappointed right from the start.  We arrived at the park about 50 mins before opening.  We expected to see some crowds but nothing like we encountered.  After waiting in line to get through security for 1 1/2 hours, we then waited in line to get through the entrance turnstiles for another 1 1/2 hours until we gave up because there were still thousands of people in front of us.  The system they have for checking tickets, etc at the turnstiles is absolutely ridiculous and places more pressure on the crowds.  We left and came back in the afternoon but of course by then the lines for the rides and shows were enormous.  There was truly no way to get on anything.  I'm not opposed to lining up for rides but I draw the line at 2-3 hour waits.  We visited midweek too - a Wed and a Thurs.  The next day was even worse - this time we arrived 1hr 45mins early and there were more people lined up to enter and they closed Disneytown down for the day for an event.  We turned around and went home.  Came back to the park at 7pm, rode Pirates with a 50 min wait and then Buzz with a 10 minute wait and then left.They need to limit the amount of people they let in each day until they get more attractions.  Hated it.Castle was beautiful though!"
525,3.0,Apr 2018,"Orton-on-the-Hill, UK ","Too many people, not enough rides.","As a Westerner and a Disney fan, this park has too few attractions and too many people.  Hopefully they will add more rides as the years go on.  Must dos are Tron and Pirates. If you've been to a Disney park anywhere, you've done everything else.  Pirates is especially good, nothing like Florida or Paris, great state of the art graphics. Fast passes are gone within 30 minutes of the park opening and you have to pay extra for a fast pass for Pirates.  Average queue times, about 90+ minutes.  Food is cheap but average, merchandise is cheap – Disney polo shirt £15/$20, in Florida £65/$80 for the same shirt.  Avoid the people in the park trying to sell you FAKE merchandise, how Disney let them get away with it is a mystery.  The Chinese don’t do queuing too well and you can do the whole park in 2 days max if you have queue for everything.  The fireworks at night are more a light show on the castle. Good experience but won’t rush back for a few years"
526,4.0,Feb 2018,"Shenyang, China ",Fantastic experience!,"First things first, download the app, make use of the map and definitely buy fast passes. Plan ahead - be there as EARLY as possible. The best rides, as mentioned before, TRON light cycle (best time of my life) - thrilling, Soaring over the Horizon - beautiful, Pirates of the Caribbean Battle for the sunken treasure - exciting, Roaring Rapids and then take a stroll through Alice in Wonderland garden. The parade, usually at...5pm, I think it was, was quite cool too. Wear comfortable shoes as you’ll be walking ALL DAY. Don’t miss the fireworks/projection mapping in the evening, be there early and find yourself a cool spot in front of the main castle for the best view. "
527,5.0,Apr 2018,"Johns Creek, GA ",Loved It!  Only wish I had more time.,"I was in Shanghai for a student trip.  We had a full agenda, but managed to cram in an evening at Shanghai Disneyland, although unfortunately it was raining.We loved the Tron ride and also Pirates.  Both were unique to that park and it was great to experience them.Given it was a Monday evening and raining, we didn't have the large crowds, but it was definitely challenging to be soaked and in business casual attire.  We would have preferred to rent lockers for some of our stuff, but found this difficult as you switched from English on the first screen to Chinese on the subsequent screens, we couldn't figure it out, so that meant hauling backpacks in the rain and having our bags put into a bin while on rides, which was not fully comfortable.The gardens and maze for the Alice in Wonderland were amazing and we enjoyed the view despite the periods of intense rain.  We only wished we had more time and a little bit better weather."
528,5.0,Dec 2017,N/A,Great experience with family on boxing day!,"Came here with my family and despite having come across some bad reviews about the bad crowd behaviour, everything was really smooth and the staff were helpful (especially the manager in Mickey Mouse Restaurant, he was damn nice!!). Honestly speaking, I did not see any unruly behaviour amongst the locals and the tourists and overall our experience was truly amazing! Love the rides, Tron is my favourite!"
529,2.0,Apr 2018,N/A,Horrible Experience!,"We stayed in Kerry Hotel Pudong. They have a coach every morning to Disneyland at 7.30am. If you're going with toddlers make sure you bring strollers. From where the coach drop you off to the entrance of Disneyland park its about 1 hour because of the crowd. We bought the 2 days pass online for weekday (Mon & Tue). Download the Shanghai Disney app. Its quite useful once you're in the park.The queue on both days were horrible. Just to get in the park was about an hour plus. The locals are not bothered about personal space. They come very close to you and if there's a gap in between they will cut you. Sigh! Once you're in the park there a strollers for rent at RMB90. And once you're in quickly access the fast pass and book your rides. You can only book 1 ride at a time. I would suggest Tron or Tarzan. Because of the insane crowd that day, by 1pm the fast pass was fully booked. Queuing up for other rides/shows was crazy. Min 45 mins to 2 hours. There a few restaurants in the park to eat or you could head to Disney Town for more varieties and cheaper meals. On the 1st day we had lunch in the park. On the 2nd day we went to Disney Town. I would suggest just to eat at the park cause even you pay slightly more its more convenient than exiting the park & re-entering. But then again feel free to explore.Shows are all in Mandarin but entertaining. The locals there behave quite bad I must say. When we entering the hall for the Jack Sparrow show some of the ladies pushed the attendants to jump over the seats. And while we were watching the Tarzan show a lady next to us was talking very loudly on her mobile. Even when we told her to shush, she didn't bother. Don't miss the fireworks show at the end. It's the best but its was just overcrowded. I wouldn't go back to Shanghai Disneyland again. Great theme park but the people, yikes!"
530,4.0,Apr 2018,"Bristol, UK ",Alone in Disneyland,"Benefit of you are here alone is you can play faster for some machine as you don't need to go in normal line (Single rider). However, fastpass is your heaven without it you need to spend 45 minutes up to 3 hours to wait, so come here early as you can and try to get at least 1 fastpass from neither Tron or Horizon because I do think those two are the best. Food here are quite expensive than usual. Full of Chinese more than 70%. I do recommend you to spend here since it open till it close. Haha"
531,5.0,Apr 2018,"Shanghai, China ",Modern fairytale,"Of course, the main problem of a park built within 3 hours drive from 300million people is that is always crowded. I have had the seasonal pass for two seasons now and I can assure you there is no period of the year when the queues get better. But it's worth it. Pirates of the Caribbean and Tron are worth the wait and alone the ticket. The food is extremely Chinese and it's forbidden to bring food inside. But you can get out, eat in one of the Western restaurant in Disneytown and then come back."

This is definitely one of the smaller and less charming locations, but it’s still Disneyland. And everyone knows that Disney is the happiest place on earth. If you avoid going over the weekends or on Chinese holidays, the park is not very crowded, and you can do everything in a day. If you go on a holiday, you won’t be able to move.This park has several great attractions, including the best Pirates of the Caribbean ride out of all the parks and an amazing Tron ride. It’s definitely worth checking out!"
533,1.0,Apr 2018,N/A,Absolutely Worst Disney,"This is the worst Disney out there and I know, I've been to them all.Pros: Park admission and hotels are reasonably priced. Tron, Pirates and Raging Rapids are some of the best rides out of any of the parks.Cons: Cast members argue with each other, lay down on merchandise and sleep, are rude or argue with customers. Rules are not enforced AT ALL! People try to cut line constantly or push their child ahead to get ahead in line. People push at the shows going in and out. It is so dangerous!!! I'm surprised no one got trampled going in and out of any of the shows! I saw child biting people to get through crowd.There are people hiding in line or around corners selling fake merchandise. This is all over the park. Disney should really do something about that.The bathrooms are some of the most unsanitary I've ever seen. There are only a few rides so be prepared for lines all day that are over 2 hours long. If you don't use the digital fast pass system then you are most likely not going to ride anything."
534,5.0,Feb 2018,"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia ",Disney Magic,This is my second time here and I understand that the park will be building more. I like the fact that you can get in out from Disneyland to downtown disney that gives you more food options. The Disney magic is always alive the moment anyone enters Disneyland. This park is no exception . 
535,3.0,Apr 2018,"Brooklyn, NY ",Not the Happiest place,"Been to several Disney parks, this is got to be the least Disney-like.  There is very little Disney atmosphere, no cheerful characters, decorations or Disney theme.  And lines and lines and lines everywhere and unfortunately, a lot of line cutters.  TicketsBuy the tickets on line, you will received a confirmation on your phone and you will be checked in at the park. The purchaser have to present an id at the gate for the ticket checkers to check in the guest.  The tickets will be printed at the gate.Getting thereThe drive is about an hour from the center of town.  A friend drove us there, he did not go in because he did not want to deal with the long lines.  there is a drop off and pick up area in the parking lot that will not charge a fee.  I was told that the train can also get you there within an hour.Entering the parkThousands of people are trying to get entry to the park (Saturday).  A long walk from the parking lot.  Upon arrival at the front gate, you will be send away from the entrance.  Everyone has to walk around a BIG loop to gain entrance to the park (at least a 20 - 30 minute walk). They tried to create a little more buffer for the massive crowd in the front.  After the loop,  If you already purchase a ticket, go to the right and through security, took us about forty five minutes.   If you have no tickets, go to the left and purchase your ticket.  Remember, no outside food allowed, they will take it.  After security, go directly to the entrance, the ticket checkers will check your phone and provide you with a ticket.  That took about half an hour. (Already over two hours on line, we got there by 8:00 AM)Fast pass/Disney park app/single riderYou can forget about the fast pass if you are a foreigner, we tried to down load the app on our phones (US &Canada) and the fast pass does not work.  Guest service was no help in getting the app to work.  But the app does provide you with some helpful information, such as map and show time.  etc.  Fast passes can also be obtained at each area's guest services.  But by the time you get there, it probably will be all gone.  Single riders is a better bet, make sure you get a piece of paper as you enter each ride, this is your pass to get on the single line.  They will not let you get on the single ride without the paper.The parkits huge, lots of walking but with very little Disney-like areas.  As you enter, there are shops on both side of the street.  The park is a circle, therefore, you can walk to the right or the left and will go to the same places.  Or go directly into the middle (castle).  There are guest services in each land, maps and time (show and ride) are available for all guest.RidesBe aware, there are long line for everything, because of the lines we only got on a couple of rides.  Tron was an interesting roller coaster, fast, no huge drops and well worth the wait.  The spider like ride was okay, but not worth the two hour wait.ShowsSaw two, Pirates of the Caribbean and Tarzan, both are very entertaining and highly recommended.  All in Chinese, but the action is really good.AttractionsStar Wars and Marvel are mostly picture taking and movie watching.  Good as a resting place after all the walking.Food and SouvenirsRelatively cheap comparing to all the other Disney parks.  T-shirts are $25 US.  Buy before noon and you will get an additional 10% off.  Food is also affordable, long lines at some areas and shorter in others.  Instead of waiting on line, walk around and you might find a stand with no line.  There is a HUGE souvenir store before the entrance of the park.  There is another one at the end of main street inside (right before you get to the castle).  Of course there is a gift shop at the exit of every ride.  But to save time shop at the two main stores, they have almost everything.Over all, the park is okay - its new and huge.  Be patient, lots of people pushing and cutting lines,  But unless you have a day to waste, not highly recommended."
536,4.0,Apr 2018,"Nottingham, UK ","An excellent Disneypark, I should know! I've been to them all!","If you can see past Chinese culture/behavior then Disneyland Shanghai is a must.  The park is really well built with excellent rides and themes.  Tron and POTC are brilliant.  What Disney really need to clamp down on is the local behavior of the Chinese as they think nothing of pushing in and its common, that and the every 50 to 100 meters of locals selling merchandise that is fake.  What I don't understand is how they get in? 1 or 2 you'd understand but they were everywhere selling fake Mickey Ears!"
537,5.0,Apr 2018,"Groningen Province, The Netherlands ",Best disneyland in the world,"Before you go to this place, you should download the disneyland shanghai app. So you will know all the lines and waits for games.I went to disneyland shanghai in the end of november 2017, weather is really cold. But it is not crowded. So i can enjoy all the games and attraction.Note: a lot of chinesse people love to cut the line."
538,3.0,Apr 2018,N/A,Long walk,"Before you can reach the entrance you would have to walk. It took us around 30 minutes from drop off to the line for bag check then probably another 20-30 mins there then line to entrance which is faster maybe 10-15 minutes. So it will take more than an hour to get inside. The place is really nice especially it’s kinda new only a few years old. Like any Disneyland queue on rides are long. They have a parade in the morning & afternoon. Their fireworks is ok, but comparing to HongKong Disneyland, HK is better and you wouldn’t really walk that far just to get to the entrance."
539,5.0,Apr 2018,"Heber City, UT ",Great,"Great Disney experience, Tron and the pirates of the Caribbean ride are amazing. Pork dumplings were delicious. Character dining was way over priced and  mediocre"
540,4.0,Apr 2018,malaysia ,Very crowded ,"Absolutely crazy, people are everywhere and mostly are of local chinese. Food are good but pricey. Average waiting time are about 60mins and those favourites waiting time goes up as high as 190mins. Parade was at 12pm and definitely a must not missed. Water cooler are easily accessible at food courts, restaurants and near to washrooms. Lots of place to sit but only lack of shades. No outside food allowed. The pastry serves absolutely yummy great buns, cakes and desserts. The checkpoints before entry will make sure all foods are not to be taken in including selfie sticks. "
541,4.0,Apr 2018,"San Francisco, CA ",Nice park,"I have only been to the original disneyland, and that was quite a while ago. But the Shanghai Disney park is very nice, open and spacious with room to move.Not as many rides as the original, but it obviously growing and adding more attractions. The line waits are seriously long..get a fast pass or the premium package."
542,5.0,Apr 2018,"Cardiff, UK ","Nice park, long lines, good value","Wasn't expecting much but thought this was a must-see now that it's open. We were based near Nanjing Street but it's easy to get to tech park by Metro. 3 lines and an hour later ( for about 50p) we arrived at a new dedicated metro station. It's a pity it isn't connected to Pudong Airport which isn't too far away.We stopped at the station coffee bar for a fast breakfast before buying our return tickets - to avoid the inevitable rush after park closing. It's about a 10 minute walk to the park. Queueing for the security check took about 15 mins then maybe another 20 minutes to buy tickets. One day ticket prices are low compared to the US. Booking in advance could be best if you're certain of when would be going - we wanted to be flexible. The ticket booth staff spoke enough English and major cards were accepted - not always the case in China.The park is slightly different as Main Street is replaced by a more non-description collection of stores etc so the approach to the Castle isn't quite as magical as it is in MKs elsewhere. The Castle is huge and the gardens around it are very picturesque. It helped that we visited on a sunny day.In terms of rides there are plenty. The problem was that the lines were very long. Pirates was the best. It's a real upgrade from any other park with a mixture of digital projections, animatronics and boats that don't just float along but can turn through 360 degrees. Unfortunately there was no fastpass and a 90 minute queue. Standby for Soarin was 120 mins and I guess Tron was worse.Fastpasses are available through the Shanghai Disney App and because so many Shanghainese have season passes they were sold out for the day by mid morning. Next time downloading the app and booking as far in advance is a must-do. A cast member did give us access to a closed fastpass station and got us passes to Buzz Lightyear which s the standard shooting gallery. However, the line for that was only around 20 mins anyway.As well as cheap to get in it was relatively cheap to eat at counter service. Lots of people had brought picnics.Toilets were good which can be an issue in China. We enjoyed the day at the park icy closed at 8 after the fireworks which were mainly a lights show projected on the castle. Then we wandered through Disneytown on the way back to the metro station.Definitely worth a visit but download the app, book in advance and reserve FPs for Soarin and Tron. "
543,5.0,Apr 2018,N/A,"Fun, but need to spend extra money to really enjoy. ","We spent a Tuesday and Wednesday at Shanghai Disneyland. We found the park itself was vastly larger than the US counterparts with the biggest difference being the open space. Most rides are updated and are superior to the US  equivalent ( attention to detail, latest technology).  The negative part of Shanghai Disneyland is in order to really enjoy the park, you have to buy Premier Access at 660RMB per person or about $104USD. This is on top of the park tickets. (Premier Access= paid Fastpasses). Tuesday we were able to hit 2 rides ( pirates and Tron) and 1 show.  Lines are literally nuts to butts. Any room left in lines you will be passed by other guests in a move we dubbed the “Shanghai Shuffle”.  Wednesday we were able to enjoy almost everything the park had to offer using Premier access and the priority entrance in Mickey Town (downtown Disney) for resort guest. Some quick service dining options you order and pay then jockey for position to get your order filled in a mix of a mosh pit meets Disney dining.   There is a culture difference between Shanghai Disneyland and other Disney parks. Try to remember this, stay on site, and but Premier Access to really enjoy this park. "
544,1.0,Apr 2018,Chicago ,A not so magical experience,"I have been to Disney parks in Orlando, Anaheim, Paris and Hong Kong.  All were really fun experiences.  Disney was either unprepared for the crowds at the Shanghai Disney or is only interested in selling as many tickets as possible regardless of the wait times experienced by their customers.  I prepaid online for tickets and never even entered the park.  The security line took about an hour and I thought after that wait I would be able to enter the park.  I then realized the second line to actually enter the park was even longer.  Thinking that maybe I had arrived at a bad time I went to Disneytown and had coffee and killed some time.  When I went back what had been two security lines was now one making the line just as bad as it had been a couple hours earlier.  Imagining what the waits must be like inside of the park and being confident that the fast passes were gone I decided to forget the whole thing.  Almost tongue in cheek I went to guest services (oddly no line) and asked if I could get my prepaid tickets refunded.  The response was that the park always has lines like that so no refund.  The irony is that the entire time I was there the loudspeaker was telling me in Mandarin and in English to ""Have a magical day.""  Not so much."
545,5.0,Apr 2018,N/A,Some suggestions for foreign Disney fans,"As a big disney fan and a season pass visitor, I have some suggestions for first time visitors to make your journey a wonderful one.For a one day or 2-day visit, I suggest to spend some extra money to avoid crowed people.Choose the options based on your budget:1. VIP tour service, about $500 per person, you need to reserve on the official website or via telephone before you go to the park. 6 hours visit with a professional staff introducing the story of each section, no queue for any attractions and a VIP position for firework show at night.(best position)2. Fast pass ticket, having a meal at royal banquet hall in the castle.FP is about $25 per attraction, you can also get free FP with their app. I suggest to buy FP of Soaring over horizon if you didn't get the free one.Meal is $70 at the castle and DO REMEMBER to buy a VIP position of the firework show(about $30, second best position)The meal and firework show VIP service also require reservation, call them at least 3 days before your visit.If you have more than 2 days visiting disney park, go to buy yourself a season pass ticket, it is more economy.Top attractions imo:soaring over horizonpirates of the caribbeantronmeet with disney princess/Jack Sparrow/Judy and Nick etc. They are really lovely and some could speak English. People are less than the attractions.Parade and firework showThe three performances in house are in Chinese but still good even you don't know what they are talking about. Star Wars fans don't miss the star war bay, it is near the Tron. Few people go there because it is not popular in China.Some Tips:Single rider pass is usually faster than the normal one, don't believe the minutes it shows. Except the dwarf rollercoaster, if you are outside the waiting cave, it will take one hour.Go early and scan your ticket with the disney app, get your FP immediately.It is Disneyland! Dreamland! Enjoy!I don't use tripadvisor, so if you still have questions you can write me emails(simonz.lycn@gmail.com) and I will reply if I have time."
546,5.0,Dec 2017,N/A,Best day ever,so we went to Disney Shang on December 2017. Inspite the weather is cold but that two days was magical. First thing when come must go to Tron first.. thumps up the best coaster for Disney Shang.. then head to Pirates Carribean then to Seven Drawfts coaster. We had so much times there. You also need to see the Tarzan performance. We don't have alot of time to catched up taking foto with the characters but we got a lot free stuffs. Yippie.... 
547,4.0,Apr 2018,"Singapore, Singapore ",Be prepare to queue,"This Disneyland is huge - loads of walking. Please read up on sites that recommend strategies for visiting Disneyland especially if you have only one day to visit it. Becos of the huge population, be prepared to queue. Go half an hour before the park opens cos you need time to clear security and collect your tickets. We went 10 mins before the park opened on a Monday and waited an hour to get in. Lucky we had 2 days here - Day 1 to cover most of the rides, and Day 2 to watch the shows, do 2 rides we didn't manage to do on Day 1, as well as repeat our fav rides. Download the Shanghai Disneyland app (better to do this in your home country where it could be faster and easier) - so easy to get the FastPass (which runs out  usually by about 10.30am). It also indicates how long the wait for the rides are, and how to get around the park.What I love: Pirates of the Carribean, Alice in Wonderland Maze, Camp Discovery, Soaring, Taking photo with Darth Vadar and Kelo Ren. (I'm too chicken to ride on Tron, but I think its amazing and oh soooo beautiful at night) .Its very clean and safe. Shopping-wise - I think Tokyo Disneyland has way more kawaii (cute) stuff."
548,3.0,Apr 2018,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ",Wonderful rides with terrible China people,"The park is new and rides are fun.Mobile app is extremely useful for checking the queues, showtime and getting around in the insanely large park.Well the facilities are good, but it was not really a happy day for us in a dreamy Disneyland.In China, line-cutting not a shock or we should say it is a culture here? Sadly no security or crew is managing the lines. Avoid being line-cut in your own way, else spend an extra hours on all the queues. Even if we confronted people who cut the line and the disneyland crew who was there witnessed the whole thing, she pretended that nothing happened.Scalpers are all around, inside and outside the park. No authority in the park to shoo them away? I guess this might be the reason that all fast-passes were out early in the morning.To experience the rides, please enjoy at least 1 hour queue for each ride before enjoy the ride. And if i remember correctly, disneyland rides were not as short as Shanghai's. Averagely queue 1 hour for a 1 minute ride.Dinings are surpringly within expectation, not really sky high prices like other entertainment parks would charge.Visit any other Disneylands and only come to Shanghai's when you have visited them all."
549,4.0,Apr 2018,"Colombo, Sri Lanka ",Loved it. ,Shanghai Disney land is fairly new and as a result is super crowded. All Park is huge and is pretty amazing with the best rides. The staff were really kind and helpful. The gift shops were very good and affordable. Not over priced. The only downfall was that the past pass is impossible to get. When asked for a past pass they want you to download an app and register on the app ( which has never happened in any other Disney lands we have been too ) this “app” does not support foreign users. As a result the queues for the rides were around 165 mins ( almost 3 hours ) which isn’t worth the time or the effort. At the end we ended up paying 80RMB for a single pass for a ride. So it’s definitely not a tourist friendly park. The food is fairly ok. Nothing all that great and 90% Chinese dishes. The evening firework display is absolutely amazing. And is absolutely worth a visit. 
550,1.0,Apr 2018,N/A,Spent the whole day and did get 2 rides,"We came urly in the morning with the metro to Shanghai Disneyland the square in front was blocked with fences so we needed to walk extra long way to get in.and there starts the waiting. The time to geht in the parc and got tickets did take 70 minutes. Because we where urly the line for the pirate's of the carabien  was only 45 minutes, but it was  More than a hour . We wanted to take a picture with Mickey but that cost extra money.We did not see any disneypuppets walking around in the crowd , maybe to dangeres because the parc was full with people and that on a normal weekday and no holidays...At the and of the day we got to the Tron waiting time 90 minutes .It is a very good ride and worth waiting .But overall no happy disneyfeeling. The worst off al the disneylands in the world"
551,2.0,Apr 2018,"Jakarta, Indonesia ",It’s crazy over there,"People said Disneyland is the happiest place on earth; well, Shanghai Disneyland is definitely not. I visit the park on Wednesday, and not a holiday season. The first person who greet me when I just arrived is a ticket scalper. I was queuing at the entrance, then another ticket scalper in the middle of tue queue and keep pushing me. After I enter the park, thought that finally free from all the scalper, i was quite shocked that I found fast pass scalper which I think is one of the reason that I was unable to get any Fast Pass (it always runs out!). The queue itself is crazy and worsen by the all the keychain and fast pass seller in the middle of the queue and will keep pushing you. People there also doesn’t understand the meaning of queue. They will keep cutting the line, and sometimes, climb the fence. The attractions are okay. Tron and Pirates of Carribean are awesome! But sadly it’s not worth the queue."
552,4.0,Apr 2018,"Suqian, China ",Best crowd controlled disney,"Arguably my families best disney park experienceTickets were purchased via the app and the required scan worked via a screenshot meaning no need for data use but, that wouldn't have mattered because there is free wi-fi easily accessed across the park.A 'typical' Disney park would have been rammed but, crowds were managed well here, as a relatively new park it was clear to see that was considered into the design.The photopass was brilliant, and easy to use. Which of course meant we left with some great photos of the day.Not every place accepts card, and the only ATM despite claiming otherwise are available at the front of the park so, make sure you carry plenty of cash. The do take AliPay, I just wish they also accepted WeChat which they do in the Disneytown section.No line was more than one hour which is quite acceptable we felt. They were always sheltered which is of course brilliant to help prevent both hypo and hyper thermia"
553,2.0,Apr 2018,N/A,Waits are ridiculous ,"Totally ill equipped for the number of people here and the amount of attractions. Nothing to do in line. Not enough fans for cooling. Definitely not what you would expect from the brand Disney. Opened way too soon for the attendance. Can’t imagine what this would be like in the busy season. Staff is well trained and park is clean but waits are excessive with little or nothing to do while in line for as much as 2 hours or more. And some of the best rides are closed. Subway in is very convenient and concession prices are reasonable but there are product salesman that accost the locals while in line. That too is not very Disney. Soft opening of Toy Story land was a welcomed surprise. Never been first to enjoy a park attraction, especially a Disney one. Hope they get geared up soon for the numbers likely to attend in the future.  Fortunately a lot of attendees are constantly on their smart phones. That kills the wait time for many except the very young ones. "
554,4.0,Apr 2018,"San Francisco, CA ",Nothing went according to plan,"I had researched extensively before our trip to Shanghai Disneyland since we only had 1 day there, and coming from the US, knew it would probably be our only chance to visit.  I  made a list of rides we wanted to go on, made sure we got there early to line up, downloaded the app, and pre-purchased tickets online.  We thought we had a leg up on everyone when we arrived around 7, but the entrance line filled up quickly and people were pushing past us right & left.  There was a large group in front of us that kept adding family members.  They only opened maybe 5-10 minutes before 8:00 AM, and when they did, people BLEW past the poor security officers and started running.  Give them your passport at the gate, they take a pic of you, give you your paper tickets, and you're through.  Things we were unprepared for:--'Pirates"" was supposed to be our first ride of the day, but it was ""temporarily closed"" when we got there, and wouldn't let you book Fastpass for it--Tried to book Premier Access Pass on app, but both of my credit cards got declined due to fraud control, even though I had notified my credit card companies ahead of time I would be in China!--""Roarin Rapids"" was violently bumpy, and pretty much everyone wears a parka on the ride in China, even though no one does in the US--""Challenge Trails"" was closed for maintenance, and we had been looking forward to this for months before our trip.--The single rider line for ""Tron"" was 60 min long / regular line 75 min long.  Instead of a separate single rider line, at the beginning you still line up in the regular line under the canopy.  Once you hit the building, a cast member will take you out of the regular line and send you to an inside single rider line.--The last 2 seats of Tron coaster are for handicapped, and you sit upright (not bent over like a motorcycle).  I was disappointed to be seated in the back as a single rider, but after doing both (upright & bent over), I surprisingly thought the upright seats were way more thrilling!--""Buzz Lightyear"" line was a nightmare.  It barely moved, and people start getting impatient.  One guy had his face planted in my husband's backpack he was so close.  Another kid tried reaching past my teenage son so he could slip by. Luckily there were 5 of us to form a wall, otherwise people would've been pouring through.--Very few Westerners.  We are Asian-Americans from US, so we kind of blended in although we did not speak the language.  We are used to the culture, so the pushing & line-cutting not a shock for us.  Despite all this, I loved the park itself--such attention to detail.  Very new, modern & clean compared to Disneyland in CA.  We even got to walk through the new ""Toy Story Land"" which is not technically open yet.  TIP: Use the app for Fast Pass, and keep checking periodically to see when you can book the next Fast Pass.  If you're not going to use FP or get a Premier Access Pass, don't go at all.  The lines are insane."
555,1.0,Apr 2018,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ",Miserable Experience,"The crowd was more than expected and the waiting time for each game were extremely long at average 2 hours with half of the time under the sun. Some of the rides/games were under maintenance. We waited for 1.5 hours for the pirates ride, and it was closed due to technical error right before our turn. Disney should have conducted the inspection regularly to avoid wasting our time. Is it a strategy to consume customers' time so that the new customers will opt for 2 days visit due to the long waiting time and rides under maintenance? This is my first and last time to visit Disneyland Shanghai and it makes me doubt about visiting other Countries' Disneyland."
556,3.0,Apr 2018,"Singapore, Singapore ",Good rides but definitely not a Disney Experience standarf,"This Disneyland is very different from any other. The rides are very high quality, specially Pirates of the Caribbean and Tron. However it is not the happiest place as the other Disneylands. The reasons are:1. I counted 9 people in different rides selling counterfeit during the lines. That really makes uncomfortable because they are trying to sell so they are very near the visitors.  2. The culture of the people is very disrespectful, they don’t queue, are very near yourself without giving the proper personal space and they spit all the time.  That makes the whole environment very uncomfortable for any non-Chinese person.3. Employees are not as good as other parks to try to make your experience unforgettable.  Some try, but the standard is not consistent with the rest of the parks. I wouldn’t return to this Disney Park. "

One of the Disney that i really want to visit after visited the other like : Hong kong Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland. In shanghai you will saw a different angle of Disney that show you the part of Mandarin/Chinese site.Because the show, announcement and feature including the greetings would be in chinese language :) ... very extraordinary isn't it.You will find a Captain Jack Sparrow, Snow White, Mickey and Donald Duck speaking chinese. Like it.the complex pretty complete with huge area that you can explore. Please make sure you have a good winter jacket on the winter seasons because it really cold and the wind is quite strong. Might be a good time to visit when in summer (maybe)wait until 8 pm as they will have spectacular Fireworks show on the main castle with laser show performance.Very easy to access and use MRT/Subway."
560,4.0,Apr 2018,"Shanghai, China ",prepare and plan...ahead,"it is a pity that the world's latest Disney is so fraught with problems however if you are prepared to plan ahead and spend ""real"" money you can enjoy this place.Stay in the resort hotel - you get VIP treatment and a side door in, bypassing the bag check, ticket check and fast pass b s. In fact this is the key advice - if you pay the big bucks (it is shanghai - remember) you will enjoy the place. Much is made of downloading the app that gives info on waiting times. Note that wifi does not seem to be universal so better if you rely on own provider to use the app.As for the resort itself, I have been to Hong Kong one and compared to this that place was off the scale. Shanghai Disneyland is geared up to give Chinese people who might never get a chance to venture out what Disney is like, so that means food, service and also even cultural stuff. Expect a lot of bustle in any indoor shop or place where you buy things. Also staff do not speak English.In saying that the place does keep tradition with the end of proceedings and actually the way it is designed does resemble what I saw in Hong Kong in terms of design.Bottom line is - pay the money stay the hotel and enjoy it the way you would expect. But plan ahead! One thing about Shanghai is money talks and that is paramount at this place."
561,3.0,Apr 2018,"Melbourne, Australia ","Big with people, Lots of People","It was pretty convenient to travel to Disneyland. We went with our children (4yo & 8mo) and my parents. We arrived there at around 9:20, despite amount of people around, it only took us 20 minutes to go through the security check, and another 20 minutes through the main gate.As we spent 2 days at Hong Kong Disneyland already, we didn't go for the rides at Shanghai Disneyland. By looking at the wait time, fast pass is a must (even the explorer canoe has 60-minute wait time). There are free fast pass you can collect and also purchased ones available. Both options have limited pass, so have to act fast want to get on the rides. The resort is very big with lots of people. We mainly walked around to take pictures. Watched a show outside the castle, but it got cancelled halfway through due to the slight drizzle. Booked a lunch at Royal Banquet Hall. Cost us ￥1800 for 4 adults' and 1 child's meal (Set menus with options of 2 course or 3 course). We only had 1*3-course meal, the other 3 meals were 2 course (entree+main or main+desert). Before we entered the dining area, we had photos taken with Minie Mouse (free for download). During our lunch, other Disney characters greeted us and had photos taken. After the meal, we had free priority access to watch the Frozen sing-along stage show. The show was in Chinese (no English subtitle unfortunately, which Hong Kong Disneyland did). My older child still enjoyed the show despite the language.We had been walking around all areas all day, taking photos and checking out the merchandise, The shops were pretty quiet at the start of the day, but got crazily busy as the day progressed. They have some generic merchandise and some exclusively to Shanghai Disneyland.Watched the parade from distance, then accidentally walked with the crowd behind the parade. People, lots of people, lots and lots of people. Queues to the toilets are common, but not much of a queue jumping witnessed considering the amount of people around. Overall, a lovely day especially for my older child.Pros: Some different rides to other Disneyland          Easy access via Metrol Line 11Cons: Lots of people on a weekday, and more on weekends and public holidays          Long wait for any rides without fast passesWould I recommend to others? Yes, Disneyland is Disneyland, it is magical even just to walk around"
562,5.0,Mar 2018,"La Habra, CA ","Buy the Premiere Pass to avoid the pushing, cutting and long lines","Really had a great time at the Shanghai Disneyland. Here is what worked for us:1) Buy the Premiere Pass (~$110 in addition to your regular admission). The pass gives to anytime fast pass access to 9 of the best rides. For us, that translated to 15 minute wait times vs. 1.5 hour waits for non fast pass. Also, you may have already read that pushing, and line cutting are the norm in China. Since this irritates me, the fast passes helped circumvent this issue. The Premiere Pass can be purchased thru the Disney App. Then scan your phone at the rides to gain fast pass access. Worked seemlessly. Bring battery charger with you as you will be using your phone continuously.2) Large Park with plenty to see and do. Generally very clean ( even the bathrooms ). But was disconcerting to see one mother have her child relieve himself in the bushes ( ~20 feet from a restroom) . I don't understand WHY3) Visited in the end of March. Weather was 72 degrees... PERFECT!4) Pirates of the Carribean was our favorite ride. A mixture of 3d digital and hard props.5) Good food and plenty of choices. Restaurants inside and just outside the park offer choices to suit your fancy.6) Only negative was that they closed at 8pm. A bit early compared to other Disneys."
563,3.0,Mar 2018,"Prague, Czech Republic ",Be prepared for waiting,"You must be patient and prepared for waiting. Everywhere. You have to wait for security screening. It took us about one hour. You have to wait for attractions, 30 to 180 minutes. Do you want to take a picture with Mickey? You have to wait about 30 minutes. And also be prepared to defend your position in the line, there is a lot of people trying to skip the line.After waiting, attractions are amazaing, as you expect and the castle is beautiful. For local visitors it is perfect choice where to spend a day. For those, who knows US parks, I am not sure if it worth a visit."
564,4.0,Apr 2018,"Cincinnati, OH ","Clean, lovely, and magical--got really lucky with crowds","If you've been to Disneyworld (Orlando), you will recognize a few rides--Buzz Lightyear, Peter Pan's Flight. Fast pass is not much advantage on Peter Pan. Soaring is a lot like the ride at Epcot. Use your fast pass on that one ASAP or purchase it; lines were consistently 2+ hours on that. Pirates of the Caribbean is 20x's better in Shanghai (4D experience). Very few coasters, sadly. Tron was fantastic and smooth but a little short. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train was a lot like Thunder Railroad, but not quite as thrilling. Because of our friend's careful planning, the longest line we waited in was about 60 minutes for the Challenge Trails at Discovery Canyon. In the rain, this ropes course was a bit perilous but really fun. We purchased a single fast pass for Soaring Over the Horizon, which was a smart move since you can use it any time that day. That frees you up to use your two ""freebie"" fast passes for other rides. We were there on a Chinese holiday, but the crowds were (miraculously) manageable. We had cool weather and some rain, which helped thin crowds. "
565,3.0,Mar 2018,"Singapore, Singapore ","The place is nice, the crowd not so...plus they don't communicate in English","My least favorite compared to the other disney resorts, simply because of a few reasons. First of all, they do not communicate in English, so it's really tough for me to order food and buy some souvenirs. Second of all, the crowd do not know how to queue and they like to bump into each other...probably a common thing in Shanghai. Third of all, you will see people smoking everywhere. It's very inconvenient if you are not a fan of cigarettes.Having said that, we managed to see a lot of attractions. Even though most of the shows are in Chinese, we tried to remember the scenes from the movies and it helped a lot. The fireworks was good, this is definitely the highlight of the theme park. If you want to have lunch at the castle, do remember to book in advance, because it can be quite difficult to secure a table there."

567,5.0,Apr 2018,"Chicago, IL ","""Magical""","Well, i have to say after reading other reviews, I thought we not going to enjoy this park but we ended up having a great time. We, got there at 8:00 am Monday and there was a line already forming for the  security check.  We got through it, and yes people do cut so hold your temper because it will not make a difference. Next was the ticket line, I suggest to buy your tickets on line and bring in the confirmation.  There is no will call so just get in the line with your confirmation and the form of ID you purchased with.  We brought our passports but they only needed the one that purchased the tickets with.  Once in the park we tried to buy the Disney Premier Fast Pass.  This is a pass that allows you to get on the main rides without waiting in line.  It costs 270 yuan.  Buy it! It will save you so much time in the park and it costs about $43.  The best money you will ever spend in China! If you have problems buying it because of the internet, just go to guest services.  The rides where great and we di"
568,5.0,Mar 2018,"Houston, TX ",Cherry Blossoms and Gardens in Full Bloom! The most beautiful International Disneyland!!,"This was our last and most beautiful interior gardens of the International Disneylands to visit (we have visited all except Tokyo Disney Sea). The castle is stunning and all the classic rides are updated - totally worth the visit.  We stayed 4 (!!) days. The light , fountain, and fireworks evening show was so beautiful!!   This is the longest we have ever stayed in any one park, but it made the entire experience very low stress (and it was because the way our flights worked out - I would recommend 3 days)!  We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel Club level and it was amazing.  Highly recommend it as the staff and service are beyond compare - there are basically 2 meals you can make of it plus a teatime and bedtime with Mickey.  Also, the best part is that the Hotel can book one fast pass a day for you in addition to the one you get once you get inside the park.Definitely download the app.  You will not be able to ""prebook"" fast passes until the moment your ticket is scanned but get familiar with it as you will want to grab the fast passes the second you enter the gate!  The gates were not supposed to open until 9 am but this Disney is notorious for opening earlier so we were inside the park  by 8:30 (I think they may have even opened at 8 am on days they said 9 am opening, and 7:30 on 8:00 days!) The crowds compare to Disney Tokyo, so I highly recommend having a plan for Fast Passes and determining your first rides of the day.  I would suggest either going to Soaring or Rapids as soon as you enter the park as those lines go up to 2 to 3 hours, or booking a Fast Pass for those rides.  They are fun, but not worth 1/3 of your day in line!  Also highly recommend the meal at the Castle at the Royal Banquet Hall. First of all, it has the best food in the Resort except for Aurora at the Disneyland Hotel.  (an aside, the food at Aurora is AMAZING!!!, while you should definitely watch the fireworks at the Park, Aurora is another great place to watch the fireworks for a different experience as they have the music going while you watch the show from across the lake - of course you can't see the fountains and visual display though!).  Back to a meal at the Castle.  It's very similar in set up to the American parks where you first have your picture taken with Minnie in her Royal Costume (no princesses at this castle meal).  She looks adorable - I've never seen this costume anywhere else.  Then you go upstairs for your meal and Mickie, Donald and Daisy come out and spend time at each table, take photos and sign autographs - so it's kind of like a Breakfast at Mickey's in the Florida Contemporary Hotel. It's great to meet the big 4 at your convenience and have a great meal as well.  We did this in Paris and the food was TERRIBLE.  Here, it was excellent!Now, for the insider tip, at the beginning of the meal, there will be a placard with an offer for 200 RMB per person (in addition to your meal price) to have access for the reserved area for the firework show right in front of the castle.  You also get a Minnie or Mickie Shanghai popcorn bucket (adorable with Asian touches!) or a Rapunzel mug (go for the popcorn!).  THIS IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!  First of all, this Firework show is AMAZING.  Having a front row view is fantastic and magical.  This castle is different than every other castle and has an incredible stage, fountains, lights, projections and firework cannons that shoot from the front of the castle.  Just the Star Wars portion of it was worth it!  Second of all, the CROWDS ARE INSANE for the fireworks show.  Chinese people love entertainment and the entire park comes to the area in front of the castle for the show.  Having a ""front row"" area with room to breath is worth every penny. You don't get a seat, just reserved space with elbow room, stroller room, etc.  I can't recommend this reserved space enough as the crowd is beyond ANYTHING I have ever seen at a fireworks show.The park is GORGEOUS but for unexpected ways.  Of course, Hong Kong is beautiful because of the natural mountains surrounding the park and the lush tropical landscape; this is different because it is in an industrial area and there is no moat of land surrounding it.  Shanghai Disney is beautiful because the GARDENS ARE INCREDIBLE!   Try to go during Cherry Blossom season, the blooms are stunning with the Castle in the background.  The weather is PERFECT.  This also might be why we the crowds were high though!Don't shy away because of reviews saying the people are rude, children urinate in public spaces - we did not see ANY OF THAT.  People can be aggressive in the lines but the cast members are quick to cut that nonsense out and make people go back to place in line.  The cast members are kind and helpful.  Even though we do not speak any Mandarin, we were able to get by with English and some pointing at photos on menus ;-)Bottom line:  Spend more than one day so you don't feel overwhelmed, have a plan for fast passes and first rides of the day, enjoy the shows (go for the Castle meal and book the reserved seating for Fireworks), and go midweek!  You will have a blast with those perspectives in mind."

570,5.0,Mar 2018,"Burnaby, Canada ",Time your trip carefully!,"We visited the park on a rainy Tuesday in March and had a fabulous day with our 12 year old daughter.  We bought out tickets online ahead of time and arrived at about 9:30 AM.  We had to wait in a long line up to get in (it took about 45 minute in the pouring rain, but that was the worst of our waiting all day).    I think if we had come a little bit later we would have had a much shorter line up to get in.As soon as we had our tickets we signed up for fast passes using the Disney app… we got Soarin at 11am as our first set of fast-passes.    We then headed straight for Pirates of the Caribbean and only waited 15 minutes…. Just spectacular and so much more impressive than the US versions.  We really enjoyed the Tron roller coaster and the Mine Train and some of our classic favorites like Peter Pan’s Flight and Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters.  We didn’t wait more than 25 minutes for anything all day, and were very surprised that the Tron ride always had a really short line.  I think that since the local school age kids were in school that day, there was a pretty young crowd in the park.  By early evening the crowds had really thinned out and we were able to get lots of rides in.Overall impression?  It felt like a classic Disney resort experience and it had some impressive technology in the park.  This was my first international Disney experience so I found it fun to have Disney infused with Chinese culture.  The park is not very big and could really use a few more anchor rides, especially considering the massive crowds that are usually there.   I’d highly recommend a trip here as long as you time it carefully."
571,5.0,Mar 2018,"Shanghai, China ",Take it easy and enjoy. Midweek visit,"Finally we made it to Disney. Took sick leave at work, got our Minnie ears on and arrived there at 8:30 in the morning.Honestly I was expecting horrible experience, after reading all these reviews, but ended up having amazing time. We had some snacks and water with us: no one took it away, but they did check our bags. Started our day with breakfast inside the park : Mickey shaped muffin and latte = 50 kuai. Cheaper then Starbucks and with view on princess castle. Priceless! And the waiter was so unbelievably nice, so that kinda set the mood for next 13 hours. We didn’t have in mind to get on as many rides as possible, rather preferred to enjoy ourselves. Did 5 attractions in result: 3 major once and 2 where we didn’t have to wait at all. Waiting time was 1-1,5 hours for Tron, Pirates and some other thrill ride. We played charades and had great time. I mean when you go to place such as Disney u certainly should be prepared to wait. What’s the point of whining about long lines, not gonna change anything. For food went to some canteen like place: rice with chicken and some veggies (including soda) = 75kuai. Same dish but ribs 110kuai. Not super cheap, right, but won’t make you cry. Portions are huge, so u certainly will be full. Didn’t encounter any rudeness nor from guests nor from stuff: everyone was nice and happy. Toilets were clean,paper and soap available(rare thing in China, trust me)Visited souvenir shop after the park was closed, they should bring more cartoons there, was missing Aladdin, little Mermaid and a lot of other major movies like Mulan or Hercules.

Taxi back was 120 yuan.We had major issues at the gate with our pre paid voucher as prepared by the travel agent.Still 7 people later and after a lot of fuss we were in. (We arrived at 10.30am and tickets for the day we’re sold out!!)We had a walk about but weren’t prepared to queue for 4 hours. Everywhere extremely busy and  I agree with previous comment - don’t let so many people in. Perhaps then people will get a ride.  I felt sorry for the kids who were naturally very excited but the queues were just so great. Quite a lot of stress for the parents.The place does look amazing and with a quarter of the people the experience would be much improved for so many reasons.I won’t be back
573,4.0,Apr 2018,N/A,Shanghai Disney - suggested tips for a smoother experience ,"Before arrival, keep an open mind about crowds,  try to tune out or focus on positive things when having the occasional negative encounter. Download the Disney apps, buy tickets online and keep the receipt. Arrive before 8am and avoid public holidays and the hotter months. Bring passport and ticket receipt with you. The first 20-30min as you meander your way from the transport drop off to entrance could be challenging due to the sea of people and miles of zigzagging fences. After the security checkpoint (don’t bring food or sharp objects), present your passport and ticket receipt to the staff at the turnstiles to redeem your tickets. Immediately after you’ve passed the turnstile, scan the QR quotes on the ticket with the Disney apps, then get your first set of fast pass (only one ride at a time). Consider buying premier pass for your favorite ride to avoid the (possible) 135min wait. The apps contains a mobile map and updates on show times and waiting times . The pirates stunt show and Tarzan shows are highly recommended. Our family enjoyed the Soaring Heights ride and Peter Pan rides. Tron also looks great but we were too scared to try. Try to have lunch before noon ahead of the crowds, and if you have younger kids do hire the stroller. The Alice in wonderland maze and the enchanted castle are great for the kids. We spent almost 12 hours in the park and enjoyed it very much. Remember all of the fast passes and premier passes will run out in the early afternoon or even late morning so act fast !"

575,4.0,Mar 2018,"Dortmund, Germany ",Good but ONLY in combination with premier access ,"I went to Disneyland Shanghai in the middle of March. So not a peak season and on Wednesday. It was incredibly crowded!!! I have never ever seen so many people in an amusement park before! And don’t forget that mostly there were Chinese people, so rude, unfriendly and with no manners at all. Maybe, just maybe, Disney should try not to make all the money in the world and limit amount of tickets per day, so people can actually have fun, but it probably won’t happen, so... I was determined to have a great day for myself, which i did, here are my two cents. I liked the one in Florida better, but this one is not all bad. First of all, you have to be mentally prepared to be pushed THE WHOLE AND ENTIRE day. Remember: manners are out in China. The funniest thing is even if you start to push, you are still not as good at it as them. Which is actually a grace for us. So just shut mentally down. First line will be to enter the Disney, the bags will be checked and they confiscated my Sun Screen (it was a spray, so take cream instead). Second: do download the APP, otherwise you are lost! Do it before, at home or hotel. Third (which is not for everyone but you might want to think about it): the moment you enter the park, get yourself a premier access. Costs unfortunately around 80€ or 90$ but otherwise i don’t know what you’re going to do there! At a non-peak season middle of the week day the lines were 70-180 (!!!) minutes! 180!!! You are just gonna waste your time. Forth: do NOT eat in park itself. Go to Disney town (you can re-enter the park with your ticket but the bag will be checked in order to find food/drinks), there are a lot of options there including (thank god) the Cheesecake Factory. Fifth: if you want to buy anything (although i have to say merchandise is catered for the Chinese taste), don’t do it in the park. Too many people in there, again being pushy and the stores are way too small. Again, go to downtown Disney, there is a huge store with everything you can find in the park minus the crowds. Or even better yet, in the Bund area there is a Disney store too, with different merchandise but way cheaper and convenient. So all in all: i managed to make the most of my day, with premier access you get fast pass to 6 or 7 attractions, that doesn’t completely eliminate waiting, but i managed to visit other attractions i wanted, had a dinner at Cheesecake Factory and bought souvenirs. Pirates of The Caribbean is absolutely stunning, i liked it a lot!!! Otherwise be prepared to wait up to 170 minutes each time. Maybe you’ll be able to ride 3 times... Unfortunately... "
576,5.0,Apr 2018,"Portland, OR ",Great Shanghai Disney Resort Experience while in wheelchair with temporary physical disability due to injury,"This is a review of the Disney Shanghai resort from the perspective of someone that recently tore his Achilles Tendon and is not able to walk at all or put any weight on one foot.  My family of four (wife, 2 kids and I) are US citizens that have been living in Shanghai for a few years.  This was our fourth trip to the resort (we went on the day before the Tomb Sweeping Qing Ming holiday) but our first time doing this with someone in a wheelchair.  Overall, we ended up having a great time and want to share our tips on how to maximize your enjoyment when one of your family members is in a wheelchair.To start, the park is often crowded and lines exceeding 2 hours for some of the most popular rides.  With the new electronic fast pass system that you can access with the Disney resort APP, you will probably only be able to get 2 fast passes for the entire day as it is so easy to use (no more racing around to the FP machines) that more of the park guests are utilizing them.  As soon as you get into the park with your tickets, make sure to scan everyone's tickets into the APP to create a Fast pass group and then request your first fast pass.  If available, the 2 best rides to use fast passes on are Soaring over the Horizon and the Roaring Rapids rides.Next, you should go into the Guest Services center right after the front entrance where you enter the park.  At this center, you can ask for a special Disability Access Service card.  This is absolutely key to enjoying your day at Disney if one of your party is in a wheelchair.  They will take your family's picture and write your name on the card.  With the card, you can request a ride you want to go on and they will write down the current time and use the estimated waiting time for the ride to determine when you can go to that ride.  For example, if it is 9am in the morning and the current wait for the Tron ride is one hour, they will write that you can go to the Tron ride at 10am.  When you go to the entrance, you generally go to the fast pass entrance and show them your card.  They will verify the ride and time, and then help escort you in as if you had a fast pass.  Once you finish riding that ride, you can go to the nearest Guest Services booth and then request to ride on another ride, where they will repeat the procedure again.  The general idea is that if you are uncomfortable waiting in long lines due to a disability, this lets you get on the rides without having to wait in a long line (but you can't get on them faster than the current wait time.).  It is a great service and the Disney employees were always happy to help and very courteous in general.  By using the card strategically for the longest wait rides, you should be able to ride almost all the major rides and also go on many other shorter wait line rides during the in between times.From an accessibility perspective, you do need to be able to stand up and shuffle a step or two to transfer from your wheelchair into the rides.  I used my arms and one good leg to help do this as there were typically lots of handles/bars on the rides to grab onto.  We went on these following rides without any major issues:  Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, Soaring over the Horizon, The Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Pirates of the Carribean, Tron, Buzz Lightyear, Peter Pan's flight.  We did not go on Roaring Rapids and could imagine that ride is a little more difficult to access unless you can step up/down into the raft.  All the shows, Marvel Universe, Star Wars Launch Bay, etc. are generally not a problem to access in a wheelchair.  Whenever our family got on the ride, they would always take the wheelchair and have it ready for us at the end of the ride.  It felt like a VIP service and at times, we couldn't believe how nice the employees were to our whole family.Here are some other things to be aware of while at the park.-  We saw very few other people with disabilities or in wheelchairs.  In general, China is not the most friendly place to those with accessibility needs or disabilities.-  Because of the culture of not going out as much while disabled or injured, be prepared to get some stares from the guests that may be in disbelief that you are at Disney in a wheelchair.  -  Overall, the vast majority of Chinese guests are polite and well behaved at Disney.  However, there are always a few bad behaving guests doing things like smoking in places they shouldn't, pushing/shoving in lines, cutting in lines or even letting their kids urinate in public.  If you go with the right mindset and are prepared, you will find that these few guests should not take away from your ability to have a great day at Disney.  -  The bathrooms also all seem to have accessible stalls and urinals.-  We ate lunch at Barbossa's Bounty and later on at the Cheesecake Factory in Disney Town and once again, all the staff were very polite and wanting to help us as much as possible.-  This should be common sense, but if your injury or disability makes it very uncomfortable to sit for long periods of time, or very difficult just to stand up and down, it may not be an enjoyable experience if one of your main desires is to go on the Disney rides.To conclude, we were pleased with how the Shanghai Disney resort treated our whole family and would recommend this as a place to visit even while in a wheel chair!"
577,2.0,Apr 2018,Tokyo ,Too Crowded,"I like Disney and have been to the parks I Orlando, Tokyo and Paris.  This park was nice and everything you expect from Disney, but the lines were brutal.  First a very long line for a bag check, then an equally long line for tickets even though we had already purchased them online.  Then... no maps in sight, I was told go to customer service... another line.  At this point it is more than two hours, and we hadn’t seen anything yet.  We hurried to get anSoaring fast Pass, but they were already gone.  My tips:  1. stay at the Disney hotel.  It isn’t that expensive and allows you into the park early, wish we would have done this.2.  Get the app and an account before you go.  I tried unsuccessfully but wish I would have tried harder.  Every where you go you are told just use the app.  3.  Buy the fat passes for all the rides if you can afford it.  I assume by this point you’ve already spent a lot to get there, it’s a shame to get that far and not get to do many rides like us.  Very disappointing experience.      My least favorite Disney experience.   The only saving grace was Tron is really cool and the Star Wars character meet and greets had almost no lines."
578,3.0,Apr 2018,"Melbourne, Australia ",Average,Average experience. The lines for rides were  between 90 and 170 minutes!!! Spent the whole day there from 10-8pm and did one ride.

579,2.0,Sep 2017,"Baltimore, MD ","Crowded, Rude People, and no enforcement of Non-Smoking","Park employees and security personnel were terrible at enforcing smoking/non-smoking areas.  That, along with rude people who ignored smoking rules made for an unpleasant start.  While waiting for the parade, there were people who pushed their way to the front at the last minute, along with other rude behaviors.  At lunch time, there was literally nowhere to sit, not even on the walls along side of the paths.  All of this was on a weekday, non-holiday day!"
580,2.0,Apr 2018,"Watchung, NJ ",I said 'how bad could the lines be?' ,They were awful. We arrived at the metro stop at 730am. It took until 930am to get through security and the turnstiles. The lines were brutal. We couldn't figure out how people managed to get ahead of us! Old and young just pushing and jostling. You can't get your fast pass until you get your paper ticket. So the first pass we got was for Tron at 10.20am. You can't get another one until after that. At 10.30 the only fastpasses available were for either buzz lightyear at 12.50 or Peter Pan at 5pm. Soaring was already gone. So we basically got 2 fast passes all day. So unless you pay extra for premium access you are doomed. The regular lines for everything were brutal. With people being so rude. None of the Disney 'cast' were the slightest bit cheerful - not a smile among them. Definitely not the Disney I have come to expect. Don't go!!
581,3.0,Apr 2018,Singapore ,On a non-peak day,"We can’t help but compare it with Disney Land/Sea Tokyo as we were in Japan 3 months ago.  We found Shanghai Disneyland to be a very much less pleasant experience unfortunately.   Reasons:1) The crowd - people just found ways to cut queues and they argued loudly when confronted.  I guess making a scene here is pretty normal.   Took us 45 minutes just to finally enter the park even though reached at 7::45am.  This also happens with queues for rides. From 8:30am to 8:30pm, we managed about 5-6 rides. Each queue averaged 1.5-2 hours wait time.....for a ride that lasts 50-120 seconds.  Come mentally prepared to wait wait wait.2) The Fast pass:  The moment we got in we managed to secure fast pass by mobile app (you can download the app after You enter the park by scanning the QR code).  And you’re allowed to obtain the next fast pass after about 2 hours later.  However, the Fast passes were so quickly snapped up for ALL rides within a few hours of opening!  We only managed to get fast passes for only 2 rides even though we were prompt to check and were there from 8:30 am til closing time.  One can’t help but wonder if this was some syndicated effort as there are touts inside the park walking around selling fast passes! Or it’s just because it’s a huge park with just enough visitors on any given non-peak day to snap up all fast passes.3) the Crew: we thought they were impolite and rough in handling the crowds. Again, we couldn’t help compare it with their Japanese counterparts. The guards will also use loud speakers to loudly (and angrily) shout instructions. Perhaps they have to be this way here.4) The Food:  taste is subjective but our verdict: thumbs-up down (3x).   Overpriced, uninspiring, run-of-the-mill fare. Just eat to fill tummy. Not for savouring.5) WiFi is congested.With all that said, and if with all those factors out of the way, it would, otherwise, have been a great place to go in terms of ride qualities. It’s Disneyland after all."
582,5.0,Mar 2018,"Sylvania, Ohio ",Didn't want to leave,"Start by saying that we are true DisneyWorld fans.  But this park is so close to perfect - the technology and cleanliness is superior.  We went during a busy time, so we opted to spend the extra for the Premier Park pass which allowed us 8 fastpasses.  Pirates of the Caribean is astounding!  Tron is good fun, Soaring is fabulous.  If you don't have a fastpass, the lines are long and intimidating.  I noticed a lot of line jumping and the lines tend to be packed tightly.  Fast pass eliminated this.  The Park itself is much larger that the Magic Kingdom in Orlando.  Guest services helped us set up the App on our phone for fastpass (no paper copies like Orlando). We spent three full days in the Park and enjoyed every minute!"
583,5.0,Oct 2017,"Asheville, NC ","I’m in love, I’m in love and I don’t care who knows it!","I absolutely adore this place. This past fall, I bought a season pass (worth it if you go at least 4 times, and then you get your money back + discounts at some restaurants and stores)! I went around 10 times by myself or with friends and I always found something new to do.  Here are my top 5 favorite attractions:*Tron- the classic ride of Disney, it’s fast, smooth and cool at night too when all the lights are on outside! *Pirates of the Caribbean boat ride- it’s in chinese, but oh my gosh, it’s great! Captain Jack Sparrow is pretty realistic and you’ll laugh, you’ll be surprised and you’ll have a great time!*Soaring over the horizon -  probably the longest line you’ll wait in, but it’s worth it! Amazing graphics and beautiful scenes! *Tarzan- this isn’t a ride, it’s a show and it amazes me every time! I’ve seen it 3 times and each experience I find something new I hadn’t noticed before! It’s an acrobatics show and the amount of dependency the actors have on each other is incredible. Wow. It’s just stunning. -Frozen show- so good! It’s happy and covers the entire plot pretty well in only 20 minutes - and in chinese! The crew that performs is adorable and a mix of Chinese and foreigners on stage. I also have quite a few friends that work at Disney, so it’s always a blast seeing them perform, and they do a stellar job of it too! They’re kind and welcoming to kids (and adults) and easy to talk to! Another perk - the Shanghai Disneyland castle is the BIGGEST castle of all Disney parks!Disney Town is great as well (you do not need a Disney pass to enter) and I’d recommend Cheesecake Factory for an evening meal. It has helpful waiters/waitresses and the food is mouth watering. I highly recommend the loaded tater tots from the appetizer menu (I eat that as a meal, they’re ridiculously good) and the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake for dessert (it’s divine). But probably do this last because the meal is heavy and you don’t want to walk around with this in your tummy all day. So yeah! If you like Disney and want to be entertained alllllll day long, I think it’s worth the money! ¥¥¥P.s. Christmas at Disney is gorgeous, but chilly (the picture at the tree is in Disney)! And the evening fireworks show is spectacular!"
584,4.0,Mar 2018,"San Diego, CA ",Disneyland on a Mega Scale,"Easiest way to get there is to take the Metro, cheap and easy.  Use the Shanghai Disneyland App to purchase tickets in advance, otherwise you will spend hours in line at the ticket booths which are very slow moving.  With the App purchase go directly to the entrance turnstyles show the ID number you used when purchasing the tickets and your in!The front entrance is similar to the entrance at Disneyland California, but even though there is a train station, there is no train, or monorail infact.  Main Street is only a few buildings long, then you hit the mega huge castle.  Stage shows are performed on the front of the castle and draws huge crowds.  Watch out for fake Chinese vendors walking around selling knock off disney stuff.  Kind of surprised this was allowed.  The park is massive, the parade takes about 2 hours to travel through the entire park.  This disneyland is very different that the ones in the USA, it has some of the same rides, other new ones, a huge pirates area.  Expect long lines for rides, food, shopping and for any show."

Good access by metro - Line11 ( when you arrived, take your return ticket in the ticket machine to be relax at return time.4.

586,2.0,Mar 2018,Woonona ,Torture,"Have never been to a Disney but have been to all the major Australian Parks. We took the Taxi from cbd to Disney which was a ride in itself as we had a young Chinese driver who thought he was a Finnish Rally Car driver. Super easy and cost is 113 yuan. $28 AUD. When we got off at the Taxi Stand. We had to walk a long long way with bugger all signage, just followed the locals. We ended up in a maze of steel barriers and were herded in like cattle by Chinese officials with super large hats. This is where we realised that Disney might not be the experience we were hoping for. This queue was very long and very slow, took about 50min to get through. Lots and lots of pushing through. Chinese here were really bad sports at queuing. We had to form a wee chain and move in unison to beat the buggers at this game. Honestly they are unreal. We watched 6 of them weave through a giant American guy and commiserated with him. He just shrugged and said “ What can I do” he was on his own with a young child so could not form a chain. We get to the end of this mosh queue and it turns out to be a security check. A man with a giant hat is letting people go in groups then having to physically block the queue while yelling at everyone. Wow what a start to a magical experience. Thank god we did not go in the summer. No shelter at all. Well this whole trauma was so they could do a ‘security check’. The guy in front of us had a huge carry on wheely bag. The guard stopped proccessions to no doubt negotiating his cut for all the merch in it. The people between him and the one barging through us were simply putting there bags on the bench, going through the detector then reaching around and grabbing their bags.... when in Rome. We followed suit and we were through with no bag check. Our two illegal apples were through the very important food, eh I mean security check. Anyway, fast pass system is a joke, queues are awful. 60min minimum and this on a slow day. Food and beverage options for snacks etc are bad. We had a really nice lunch at the pirates of the Caribbean restaurant. Really really good and for $20 AUD each. Best experience of the day. Overall this place has no heart and no Disney Magic. No characters. Oh we did see an impromptu Beauty and the Beast play in the picnic area. But is was a total WTF moment. It lasted 10 min and made no real sense to the movie scenes, a Chinese take I guess. Super lame effort. Our boy was so un-impressed and my wife was almost irate. I just tried to stay calm and chin up the whole thing. By 6pm we were done and gapped it, abandoned the fireworks as too hard and had enough of being taken for complete mugs. If your an Aussie, don’t bother. Go to The Gold Coast. The rides are, over all a lot better. No real thrill rides here at all. Luna Park has more thrill. The only good rides are Tron and Pirates. The Soaring thing had a 180min queue all day so did not do that. If you don’t like your kids or want to punish them, then this would be a great option. "
587,5.0,Mar 2018,"United States, ",So Much To See,"This was my first time at Disneyland Shanghai.  I read many of the reviews ahead of time in order to be best prepared for this whirlwind one day visit.  I did the following: 1. Downloaded the Disneyland Shanghai App and created an account.2. Bought my ticket in the App.  Weekday visits are ~$20USD cheaper than weekends.3. Identified the Fast Pass rides that I wanted to sign.4. Brought my ID that I referenced when purchasing the tickets (otherwise no ticket issued).5. Identified the best subway route from my hotel in Pudong (5RMB total!).  Disneyland station was much closer than taking a taxi cab and walking from the drop off area.6. Arrived before the 8 AM opening on Saturday.  We were queued up outside the security gates until about 7:50AM.  Upon opening everyone rushed forward and some people were making any excuse to pass the people in front of them.  Metal detectors kept going off but no one searched.  Most of the focus was on bag inspection.  People brought their own food and none was confiscated.7. Picked up my paper ticket at the entrance (skip the ticket booths) after showing my ID.8. Signed up for my first fast pass on the app and then proceeded to visit my top rides or shows. 9. Monitored show times and ride wait times via the app.10. Repeated fast pass sign up every 2 hours (minimum interval to get another fast pass) until they ran out (happened around lunchtime). 11. Rode rides and watched shows until hungry or too tired.  Food is expensive. Overall the most popular rides were Tron, Soaring, Pirates and Seven Dwarfs.  Most of these had 150 minutes plus during most of my visit.  The best live shows were the parade and Tarzan. I spent 7 hours but was too tired to catch the fireworks show.    Definitely will come back again and maybe even spend 2 days."
588,4.0,Mar 2018,"Phoenix, AZ ",Fun but I had NO LINES!,"Not quite sure I understand how I managed to go on a day with ten minute queues but I will take it! This isn’t all the magic of Disney (see Orlando for that) but it was worth the trip outside the city. You can only take that many buildings for so long! I loved their Tron and Pirates ride— so fun! Pirates is better than the original, impressed! Something I didn’t think about — all shows and rides are in Chinese! This makes total sense but I quickly opted out of the shows, haha! Also note that a certain percentage is not really Disney affiliated so those rides are a bit unique! (Think actual canoeing...)All in all, glad I came but I think the low low low crowd had A LOT to do with it. "
589,1.0,Mar 2018,"Sydney, Australia ",Shocking Experience,"Absolutely awful. Spent the entire day in queues which ranged from 90 to 120 minutes in length. Were there for the whole day from 8am and managed 5 rides. Kicked off the day by being herded like cattle in a queue vfor over an hour so they could check your bags to make sure you weren't bringing food into the park, this is before lining up for tickets. Disgusting way to treat people and everyone was queue jumping. Nothing is in English there, none of the staff speak any English so be prepared to struggle. The park centres on a ridiculous app with fiendishly complicated and very expensive fast pass procedures. There are no actual maps anywhere in the park! You'll be lucky to be allocated one single fast pass that's all we got the whole day. Park is completely lacking in atmosphere, doesn't feel remotely like Disney at all. There are not enough rides here not by a long shot and far too many people, all competing to go on the same handful of rides. If you've been to an American or European Disney, or any decent theme park, give this a miss you'll be disappointed. Unless you're happy to just walk around and not even attempt going on any rides. "
590,1.0,Mar 2018,"London, UK ",Horrid experience - very very long queues ,We came here on a Wednesday in non peak season and yet it was super crowded.  I have been to Disneyland and Universal in multiple locations but never experienced crowds like this. The average wait time was 90 mins. We could do only 3 rides from 10:00 to 8:00!Also there are NO shows in English! Not even 1. That's very disappointing - places like Paris and HongKong have at least 1 in 3 shows as English. 
591,4.0,Mar 2018,"Ipswich, Australia ",Typical Disney Magic,"We have now been to all the Disney Parks except Paris (to-do list entry). Shanghai is amazing and all you would expect of a Disney Park. It has a few attraction missing, all the mountains for instance (Thunder, Splash and Space) but it has THE best version of Pirates of the Caribbean of all the parks. They are the only park at present to have Tron, which we have never experienced before and it is amazing. And their version of the Storybook boat ride is better in my opinion than the ones in the US also. It was nowhere near as crowded as I anticipated it to be but then we went on a Thursday and Friday and it was drizzling on and off both days."
592,5.0,Mar 2018,Texas ,Resort stay,We visited in March of 2018. This was the only Disney park that we had never visited. It's a great park is much bigger than other Magic Kingdoms. Be prepared for lots of walking. The best way to visit this park is to stay at one of the two resort hotels. They have a special entrance for resort guests that saves lots of time when entering the park. We only paid 750 CNY at the Toy Story Hotel. Buy your tickets at the hotel and it gives you access to the special entrance and they give you bonus fast pass selections. Next to the Special entrance is Disney Town with a Chesscake Factory and Wolf Gang Puck restaurant. Skip eating meals in the park and eat at any of the restaurants in Disney Town. The cost less and have quicker service. This park is hit or miss with crowds. We visited on a Wednesday and rode every attraction. The following day the park was very crowded and we could only get two fast passes. Tip is to ride TRON during the last hour the park is open. the line gets really short even on busy days. 
593,4.0,Dec 2017,Singapore ,Exciting Day,"Disneyland will be quite distant from the centre of Shanghai; it takes about an hour to get there. Unless your accommodation is close to the park, travel earlier to avoid huge crowds when buying tickets.Be wary of peddlers who will try to sell you fake tickets, claiming they bought extra tickets and try to sell it to you for a lower price. Once you pass the security and entrance gates, connect to the Guest WiFi and obtain your FastPasses for the hot and popular rides. FastPasses are free and are given on a first come first serve basis, so get yours as soon as possible on the Disneyland Shanghai App once you're in.Also, the PhotoPass is also very worth it if you want to download your pictures from the rides and images taken with mascots around Disneyland. With the PhotoPass, photos taken will be available online for download. Personally, for me, it is very convenient and cheap. I do not indeed like printed pictures, the idea of soft copies makes more sense to me. Plus, the PhotoPass is sold at a reasonable price!Many rides are closed for maintenance, but it was still as good! Queues for the rides can get long, so plan your time wisely. Fireworks was spectacular, especially since it is at night. What a beauty!Certainly will be back when the whole park is open!"
594,5.0,Mar 2018,"Helsinki, Finland ","Had a magical day - no crowds, no Fastpasses, no worries","We arrived an hour after opening, waited for a while for the security check, and went to see if we could get Fastpasses. Unfortunately we couldn’t log on to the guest wifi, so we had to continue without the app or Fastpasses, which turned out to be perfectly fine!We headed to Tron first: 15 minute wait, so much fun! Went to the Pirates and Horizon rides, only 10-15 minute waits! Got some snacks, enjoyed the other fun activities and just enjoyed the atmosphere at the park. When we went to get another map, a kind employee asked us if we had the app, saw that we couldn’t log on to the wifi, and put her own phone number so we could get access to the wifi and it worked! This helped a little, but honestly, we were fine without it...!I guess we got lucky! We only saw one kid pee in the bush with some help from his dad, there was security and cleaning staff everywhere. Truly enjoyable and magical!"

From a Florida boy living in Japan. ------------------California, Tokyo, Florida have NO SLOW DAYS anymore, this place has slow days still, so choose non weekends and non Chinese holidays and you can easily find a nice slow day to go. We waited less than 5 minutes on each ride/attraction both days we were there. Staff is great and friendly and again BEST Disney experience I have ever had. I dont think I can ever go back to Cali, Tokyo or maybe even Florida. My kids would kill me. They were spoiled  with riding whatever they want, whenever they want and how many times they want with Shanghai Disney Land."

Average waiting time was around 20mins. Three of the best rides we ❤️:Tron @ TomorrowlandPirates of the Caribbean @ Treasure Cove Soaring Over the Horizon @ Adventure Isle - this is very similar to Agila of Enchanted Kingdom PHDisneylandVisited:Anaheim, Paris, HongKong, Tokyo &Shanghai 😊"
597,5.0,Mar 2018,"Santa Rosa, CA ",Must Have Been My LUCKY DAY at Shanghai Disneyland!,"Visited the park for 5 hours late on a Friday afternoon with a group of about 35 business colleagues. First time visit. Air quality was very good - blue skies which had not been the case during the week. The park was nearly empty. Easy to get close in park with bus. Did not wait very long to enter park. There were nearby lockers for backpacks. We waited 25 minutes to do Pirates of the Caribbean - the actual ride felt pretty short but was exciting. I am older so my experience at Anaheim is really outdated on this ride. We watched one of the parades easily enough. The park is clean and the map is really easy to follow. Went to the food area and had snacks and drinks in Cheesecake Factory followed by dinner in private dining area. Dining room at exterior balcony to observe the fireworks show - which was very nice but not has large or impressive as other Disney shows. Overall, this was a great excursion and Disney magic is present. Highly recommend."
598,3.0,Mar 2018,"Ramat Gan, Israel ",Seen better parks,"I’ve been to some parks, but this one is not as interesting as the others. Sure, the scenery is great and the Disney magic is present, but one cannot ignore the lack of rollercoasters or other trilling rides.  "
599,4.0,Apr 2017,"Leopold, Australia ",Great place aweaome attractions,We went here with no expectations and were very happy.  Even though all the shows are in Chinese (obviously). They were all entertaining and we enjoyed it thoroughly.  We caught the metro out to it and it is easy cheap and no problems.  The Mabel exhibit was amazing.
600,5.0,Dec 2017,"Brookline, MA ",Same Disney Vibe - Half a World Away,"Being from the States I was worried that I wasn't going to enjoy myself here, due to all the seemingly negative reviews about Disneyland Shanghai online by travelers. The girlfriend and I ventured here anyway, and I am very glad we did.Overall Positives:- Despite other reviews I've seen, the park was kept very clean. I saw many maintenance workers throughout the day and really saw no issues with litter or cleanliness (certainly no more than I see in WDW).- Whole Park had free guest wifi. This was a big help to those with slow phone service in this area. The only downside was you DO need a text message code to get on the wifi, so you will need to have at least enough phone service to receive the text message.- Lots of security and cast members visible throughout the park. The whole time I felt very secure and it seemed with the uptick in security/staff presence, guests were well behaved for the most part.Overall Negatives:- Guests were somewhat rude (lots of pushing and personal space issues when waiting in line). A bit of line cutting as well, but it was not out of hand, if you block them they basically just stop.- Uneccessary Running. For some reason, most people run from the Subway to the entrance of the park. It's not neccessarily a bad thing, but it causes a lot of commotion and can be unsafe if you are in the way of a stampede of people. Once inside there is barely any running.- Unauthorized people selling items outside and inside the park. Often times in the bathrooms, in line at the entrance, and in line at rides, you will find guests trying to sell 2nd hand merchandise. They won't bother you, just weird for even being there. Best to just ignore them or tell a staff member.- Fast Passes are useless after 12pm. Since there are only 7 rides that allow fast passes at Disneyland Shanghai, the passes run out quickly. Using the app you can get one per person immediately after entering the park. Fast passes for Soarin are gone 20 minutes after park open. Most other fast passes will be gone by 11:30am.-  Waiting time is pretty lengthy. Because of Disneyland Shanghai's popularity, the amount of people they let in, and that there are only a few non-child oriented rides, the waits for rides gets kinda ridiculous. By 12 pm Tron and Soarin had over 100 minute wait times (they hit 180 minutes and 210 minutes respectively at their peak), and all other rides tend to get at least a 50 minute wait by 12:30 pm. My advice is get there early to get on as many rides as possible while the waits are managable.Ride Highlights:Peter Pan's Flight - Absolutely classic and stunning. This ride gives a well needed update to the original at WDW. It's got a better wow-factor with bold scenery and a tech upgrade.- Seven Dwarfs Mine Train Ride - Probably extremely similar to the same ride at WDW, but if you've never been on it, I urge you to try. Loved the nostalgic atmosphere  and characters of the Snow White incorporated into this ride. Also just a fun mix of indoor and outdoor ride time, with thrilling bank curves and small drops.- Pirates of the Caribbean Battle for the Sunken Treasure - Absolutely Amazing! By far the best ride of the day. I was floored by everything about this ride. I was expecting the same old animatronic pirates like WDW, but boy was I wrong. This action packed ride made my whole day. There's no fast pass available for this one, but don't let that fool you, it's a ""must see"" attraction. - Roaring Rapids - Extremely similar to the ride at WDW's Animal Kingdom. This one had more dips, spins, and rougher rapids than I remember however. You'll get a bit wet, but it's minimal. There are ponchos for sale for 10¥ each, but you really don't need one. Multiple people also offered us their poncho once they got off the ride, but still the ride doesn't warrant a poncho.- Soarin Over the Horizon - It's a fantastic ride that get you super immersed in flying over some of the worlds most beautiful landscapes and monuments. That being said, it's almost identical to the one in WDW Epcot. For some reason this ride is the most popular and has the longest wait at any given time. Consider riding this one early in the day. We got in line for this when it was a 165 minute wait, but only had to wait 110 minutes (winning?) so take that as you will.- Buzz Lightyear Planet Rescure - Always a fun time for the whole family. It's an interactive one where you can shoot at Zorg, again similar to the one in WDW Magic Kingdom. Highly recommended though as it's a great stress reliever and kind of different than the other rides in the park.All in all, this is certainly one of the best things to do for families, friends, or couples in Shanghai. Be prepared for both the positives and the negatives of the trip and you'll do just fine. Enjoy!"

602,5.0,Feb 2018,"Manchester, UK ",A Great Experience with minor issues,"I was extremely impressed with the Chinese feel in Shanghai Disneyland. The offers and prices for all the merchandise are the best I’ve seen in any Disney park! The cast members are extremely helpful and efficient and do their best to communicate with international travellers. The food was amazing (minus the peeking duck pizza from Pinocchio village Haus which was in my opinion very disappointing). The prices in my opinion are reasonable compared to other Disney parks around the world.The bus service from the Toy Story Hotel to the park was very convenient and I never waited more than 10 minutes for a bus.The Chinese people do not understand personal space and it’s non existent to them. When waiting in queues I felt like I was being very intimate with people and it made me extremely uncomfortable. Many times I advised them to not get too close but being English they A, did not understand and B, even if they did understand they wouldn’t care anyway.Throughout the 4 days we were there we used the park entrance at Disney town as we were staying in the Toy Story Hotel. Access was given 1 hour before the park opened. It gave Disney hotel guests the chance to utilise the fast pass system and we managed to get on all the attractions at least twice during our stay in Shanghai. Meet and greets with the characters had hardly any wait at all and I would highly recommend purchasing the photopass. The photos the photopass cast members took were fantastic and I’ll treasure the memories for life. The character interactions in Shanghai Disney were the best I’ve had. Queue jumping is normal in Shanghai Disney but we didn’t let it happen to us. Illegal sellers were in the queues selling Disney merchandise but we have no idea why or even how they have got through security.. surely they must know what they are intending to do when they have their bags searched. I witnessed many being escorted out of the park by security. Do not purchase tickets from anyone other than an official Disney retailer as you will be wasting your money. Each ticket requires a photo to be taken upon purchase to prove you are the buyer.. if your photo doesn’t match the ticket it becomes void. The firework and projection show we didn’t end up seeing because it was too busy.. everyone is literally squashed together with their hands in the air filming. Kids on shoulders also reduces vision. In my opinion as the park expands and more people visit this is going to create huge disappointment and issues for all guests. We visited during the Chinese New Year celebration and the shows and Chinese feel was just stunning.I’d highly recommend visiting Shanghai Disneyland but I would avoid busy times and public holidays if you can. If anyone has any questions please feel free to ask.. Thanks for reading my review and I hope you have a magical day. "

The two pirate attractions were fabulous, but the rest of the park was a little disappointing as there were not very many shows and rides at this time.  Undoubtedly, these will be added over time.  The price was very reasonable."
604,5.0,Dec 2017,"Singapore, Singapore ",One of the best Disney Parks!,"The park was surprisingly extremely clean and has a very DISNEY vibe! The crowd during December had very little people, so it was easy to navigate around without the swarm of people. The crew members welcomed everyone and helped out greatly. My favourite parts were the disney town (outside) ,the pirates of the carribean ride (spectacular) and the miraculous hotel service and hotel they privided(shanghai disney hotel). But the park had one disappointment, a few people had cut the queue! Anyway, there were some extremely enjoyable and interactive parts like the princess disney transformation ( which my youngest daughter, Daphne loved !) . So to round this up, I think that this is an excellent place for young and old ones to go to."
605,5.0,Oct 2017,shanghai ,Get the App,"There's tons of info out there about what to do and what to see but most important - get the app.  Among other functions, It allows you to get your fastpass tickets on your phone, and tells you how long the lines are at different attractions.  You can also purchase a fastpass for a ride for 50 RMB since you can only get free ones ever few hours and the lines can be long on most days. "

607,5.0,Mar 2017,"Shanghai, China ",Better than Hong Kong and Paris,"I was really impressed by the new Disneyland, highly recommend to get there early to avoid the queues and probably avoid the weekends and holidays altogether.

608,5.0,Nov 2017,"Los Angeles, CA ",An amazing park,"Disney World has more to offer overall, but for a single theme park, Shanghai Disneyland is phenomenal.  The scale of the castle blows all other Disney castle out of the water.  There might not be as many rides as some of the other Disney parks, but most of the rides are designed with more advanced technology.  e.g. their version Peter Pan was far superior to others I have visited although following the same general storyline.  The Pirates of the Caribbean attraction left my friend and I in awe.  As for food, it was difficult for our party of more finicky Americans. Fortunately, we found some delicious pizza.  As for the etiquette, Disney should not be blamed for the behavior of their guests.  I have read horror stories from the opening year, but we didn't experience anything too extreme.  There were a few peddlers in the line leading to the main entrance, but they weren't pushy. We didn't witness any public urination in the park whatsoever, so that was a plus (I did witness that a couple times in Disneyland Paris, however).  The greatest violation in etiquette was line cutting, which was attempted on my party probably 6-7 times over the two days we spent at the park.  We were adamant about maintaining our position in line, however, and formed a physical wall when the line cutters approached.  They would inch forward or around, which was pretty annoying, but no one ever became confrontational. In the end, no one cut in front of us.  It can get your blood boiling, though."

610,4.0,Dec 2017,N/A,A fun last minute trip to Disney,"We live near Shanghai and were hesitant to go since we hear so much about the crowds and wait time for the rides.  Also, the air quality is so often in the hazardous range so I don't want to be outside all day with gray skies and nasty air.  And pay a bunch of money and wait in long lines.  Buuuuuut, we had a GREAT day.  We looked at the aqi forecast and saw that it would be pretty good, and it was. It was also very cold, so we bundled up.  We chose to go midweek due to crowd size and also the cost, which is cheaper than weekend.  To me, this is the only way to go if possible--midweek, good aqi, not holiday, not perfect weather, when everyone else will be there.  The crowd was manageable and some rides had no lines or short wait time all day.  Others we had to plan and use fastpass for.  I can't imagine going there on a ""busy"" day.  We used the Disney app all day.  It was very helpful.  Another ride tip--go in the single rider line if you don't care if you ride with your friends.  We did this and basically walked on the ride before even the fastpass riders."
611,5.0,Nov 2017,"Bellevue, WA ",The happy's place on earth,"Yes, we were all every excited about visiting Shanghai Disneyland.  It was our family first time at Disneyland and our kiddo's very first in Disneyland.  We went on a weekday to avoid the crowd, which worked our pretty well.  My kiddo is too young for most of the rides, but all the rides we went on only waited for about 5 - 10 minutes.  The longest wait time was around 30 minutes, that was for the princess photo moment.  The weather in Nov could be a little wet/misty, but not too bed. We will be back the next time we are in Shanghai."
612,5.0,Jan 2018,"Brasilia, DF ",Wonderful,"My family and I went on a Wednesday in one of the few egg blue skies days of our trip inwinter. During the weekdays the ticket is cheaper and there are less people. We bought the ticketsdirectly in the park and the line was extremely quick. The park follows the same Disney pattern,being well kept, clean and big. Unlike other reviews, I didn't find any of the workers in the parkrude or unhelpful. Maybe it was because the park was relatively empty, but any time I had adoubt and questioned any of them, if they couldn't answer they searched for someone who could.We didn't catch any big lines or had any problem using the Fastpass available in the park. If youhaven't previously downloaded the app, the are several stations in the park where you can getyour Fastpass, but only with a Chinese and English language option. As we are a family ofadults, the main attractions we went were Pirates of the Caribbean, Soaring and Tron. The firstone is an upgraded version of the same attraction in Orlando, Soaring was identical and Tron wasan amazing ride, especially in the first row, and I recommend choosing the single rider for thisride as the line is less than half the time of the other. As for the shows, the Parade was a mustwatch, while the pirate show was half the time a comedy show in Chinese. The Tarzan show hadreally great acrobats but, like the other show, it lacked the heart and family feeling of the showsseen in Orlando. The food in the park was expensive so we preferred to have dinner at theCheesecake Factory in Disneytown. We went there by the subway line 11, which begins at theHongqiao Railway Stations (lines 2 and 10) and it was almost empty both in the morning and atnight, so we went seated the whole 11 stations, I think, until the Hongqiao Sation. I suggestbuying the return subway ticket when you arrive at the Disney station the avoid lines to buy itspecially after a long day of walking inside the park."
613,1.0,Feb 2018,"Auburn Hills, MI ",Chinese at their worst,"I’m not a racist, but the Chinese that come here and the scalpers/fake merchandise peddlers are the worst you can find in the country.People were cutting in line, pressuring you constantly (even within the park) to buy fake stuff, and they even stole our baby stroller... the park staff was absolutely useless as well. I checked the internet and I guess getting strollers stolen is nothing new. Disneyland refuses to change their policy to check strollers or to keep a staff out to keep an eye on them. If this is something that happens often, why not change the policy or let families take their stroller in? By the way, the staff only provided a temporary stroller that was filthy that I had to clean myself. Crumbs and stains all over it... just stay away from this place. It will be the worst experience of your life."
614,4.0,Feb 2018,"Beijing, China, ",Go on a rainy day!,"Thankfully I went on a day when it was raining and snowing in January. That meant no lines. The best ride was the TRON ride which had a 10 min wait. The other rides were not that great in my opinion but make sure you bring a rain coat for the water rides! Everything else had about a 1 min wait. Had dinner in Club 33, the food was alright the duck foie gras being the best dish. The fireworks were great from Club 33 but the rain and snow really hampered the experience. Main point if you can brace the cold weather go on an ugly day since there will be no lines. Also they have lockers for storage. In addition all the rides are in Chinese. The best thing is you can take the subway all the way to the park and if you have the subway app you can use your phone to pay for the subway via QR code. Also worth checking out the restaurant Hatsune by the port in Disneytown. Some great Japanese food there and reasonable prices! "
615,3.0,Jan 2018,"Singapore, Singapore ",Not magical enough.,First time to this Disneyland. Nothing much and rides are not really fantastic. Hotel staff help me book the ticket online which avoid the queuing. Overall is one visit is enough. 
616,3.0,Oct 2017,"Sydney, Australia ",Not quite the happiest place on Earth,"I have to say, although the rides are pretty damn good, it does not have the charm of Disneyland LA, being so new. The lines were pretty awful. Expect 2-3 hours!! And people are quite happy to push in and do everything they can to get past you if you refuse to let them through. You need AT LEAST 2 days to be able to explore the whole park. Food was pretty meh, BYO snacks. You need your passport with you (most places require this in China). The second day we did it was drizzling rain which shortened the queues a little. DEFINITELY make use of Fastpass which is FREE. Download the app before you get there, arrive as soon as it opens and lock in your fastpass times which you can use every 2 hours. Time slots go pretty quickly so choose carefully. We stayed at the Toy Story Hotel which was beyond fantastic!"
617,2.0,Jun 2017,"Colne, UK, ",So disappointing,"My wife and I have been to all 6 Disney Parks in the world. We came here on her birthday as a treat to complete our Disney Parks. I can't begin to explain how bad it is.We arrived at 07:30 for the 8am opening time and queued for 45 mins just to get in. We then queued for another 45mins for security before we even got though the gates. People were pushing, shoving, cutting in line. Children were crying and it was so hot and stuffy. At this point we could have turned around and walked away. On entering the park we went straight to Tron and got a fast past. We then went on Buzz and then onto Tron; both rides were good. Thats where it ended. Times were well over 75mins for anything else and that would have been fine normally in a different Disney Park if it wasn't for the rude and terrible locals. In the days leading up to going we were told tickets were sold out for the day but then noticed that locals get in using their ID cards. They take massive rucksacks of food and just spend the day eating and throwing litter and urinating in the bushes. I saw people selling fake Disney merchandise in the ride queues and even saw a proper fist fight!! In Disney! The locals are awful as well. Unlike in any other Disney Park, and I include Tokyo and Hong Kong in this, Shanghai Disney people do what they want. The push in line, cut lines; in fact lines don't really exist. They are rude and disgusting as well. Children urinating in lines and litter is everywhere. They seem to be constantly panicking as well. When a line opens they run like their life depends on it. Same for shows, restaurants, tills opening; anything really. We are seasoned Disney visitors and we made our day our own and actually enjoyed it towards the end. That was because we just gave up doing anything and just enjoyed shopping eating, walking around, a couple more rides then the fireworks which were good. DO NOT make a special trip to go to Shanghai Disney especially westerners. If you are in Shanghai and want to visit then do so at your own risk knowing that it is the worst Disney Park ever. So disappointing."

There were hundreds of thousand of people in the park, we had to wait in long queues for no matter facilities/restaurants/restrooms/stores. It took us 75mins to wait for a stupid merry-go-round and 200mins+ for the roller coasters. The fast past machine broke down, which made the day even worse. Just don't go to this place on holidays."
621,1.0,Oct 2017,N/A,Trip with my little sister,"This is probably the worst Disneyland. The only reason why I'm rating it 2/5 is because I love Disney. But the experience itself was the worst. There were no friendly staff, every attraction has someone who is cutting the line AND there are people smoking while in LINE WHILE THERE ARE KIDS AROUND. The parade was also probably the shortest Disney parade in all Disneyland. ALSO there are people who are selling fake Disney items. How do they even get in?Disney should seriously do an overhaul in this place."

623,5.0,Jan 2018,"Mansfield, MO ",Disney Does it Again!!,"While in Shanghai, we decided to try out their Disney Park and were delighted with the Asian spin on a beloved classic:  Disneyland!!  We had a wonderful time and were delighted by all the attractions!! The food was delicious, too.  We opted for Chinese since we were in China!! It is the year of the dog for Chinese New Year and Pluto was featured on the decor for the upcoming celebrations! We rode the Tron coaster, boasting the fastest of all Disney parks combined.  Also, the Pirates of the Caribbean ride was the best one we’d seen.  Super cool and even though we didn’t understand the their language, we are familiar enough with the movies to enjoy the ride experience.  We rode multiple times as it was super cool.  We went on a weekday as the price was less than their weekend pricing, although their weekend price was still a fraction of what a USA park would be.  Very affordable although the food and gift shops were typically pricey.  We went for one day, however, I would recommend two or more, especially if you go in peak season or have children 10 and up. My husband and I loved our experience there, along with our 19 year old daughter.  "
624,2.0,Jan 2018,"Cheshire, UK ",Unmagical day at Disney,"I'm a huge Disney fan and Disney always feels magical to me even Disney stores but this Disney kind of ruined the magic for me. To start with the staff were so rude unfriendly and unhelpful! The website doesn't state you need passports and I was nearly refused a ticket I was asked if I remembered my passport number and I said I'd look for ID pictures on my phone as I did someone shoved me out the way and the server ignored me! Then told me to go to guest services and said I was lying (unsure what about) so the start of my day I was already angry! Luckily my boyfriend had his Disney Paris annual pass so we were eventually let in the park. The maps were not given to us and they had none in English anyway but signage was awful had no idea where I was going. Wait times were a joke 2-3 and a half hours all the fast passes were gone, people were pushing and shoving everywhere no manners whatsoever. I got a seat for the parade 45 minutes before the start to be shoved out the way and barely seeing anything. I was upset and angry the whole day because of the rudeness of the people and the staff I hated it tbh!"

As well highly rec. to download the app it’ll tell you live, the waiting time per ride. I’ve done Thor twice as it was amazing!!

Pirates Sunken Treasure ride & C Jack Sparrow’s Stunt show were remarkable!  I’m sure the little girls will agree, our final stop Encounter with endearing Stich was delightful.One note though, we went on a high volume day due to Winter Holidays. The queue for rides were long so we opted for the Premier access making the trip more costly. Great there was easy quick access to Disneytown, we went over for breakfast, afternoon Starbucks cuppa & dinner before we headed home. Overall a lovely Birthday out at Shanghai Disneyland."
628,4.0,Dec 2017,"Brisbane, Australia, ",Authentically Disney and Distinctly Chinese,"I love Disney and their parks, I have been to all of them several times and this was my first visit to the Shanghai Disney to complete them all. This is a park that should be visited for several reasons. Firstly, we spent two days at the park but in reality, it could be done in 1 day if you plan properly or otherwise 1.5 days. From our experience we had great service and found the staff very helpful and most spoke English to a satisfactory level. Our pre-purchased tickets from Australia had a few issues and the staff tried to help us resolve them even though it wasn't their fault, which took quite a while of their time and they kept trying. The best English was at the Food and Gift Shops whilst in the park. However, in reality, most things could be done without speaking or by just pointing. If you can book your tickets on the website, with accommodation or on the app before you get there. This will mean that you will have ticket linked to your account before you arrive and when you log into the app you will be able to access Fastpasses quicker. The lines are quite long, so arrive as early as you can before the park opens to get in quicker. Once your ticket has been scanned you will then be able to access Fastpasses through the app. The park has free WiFi and the app has live wait times for the rides. YOU WILL NEED A PASSPORT TO ENTER THE PARK. Shanghai Disneyland offers several rides that are unique to the park, it is my strongest recommendation to go on the Tron Legacy ride. It is simply fantastic, it is a super fast coaster that is set on a Tron lightcycle. It is a relatively short ride but has the longest line in the park. In addition, the Pirates of the Caribbean Ride is unique to this park and is completely different to the other versions of this ride, relying more on digital screens. There is no fastpass for this but the lines were never too long. Arguably busier than Tron is Soaring over the Horizon which had its FastPass exhaust the fastest in the Park and had a 3hr+ wait time at all times. Other rides include, Snow White Dwarf Mine, Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, Peter Pan's Flights and Buzz Lightyear's Planet Rescue, all of which have Fastpass. It was noted that this park has less of a focus on rides and more on entertainment attractions, which are all in Chinese. The Enchanted Storybook Castle is the biggest Disney Castle and can be accessed from all four sides leading to a large middle. It can also be climbed as part of the ""Once Upon a Time"" Adventure and contains a restaurant. It is worth coming and looking at the castle from all sides, especially the inside. The food isn't too expensive for a theme park, but if you are after options for Western Food then it can be quite limited. They also have a few popcorn containers and variety of special novelty cups that can be purchased. Overall, this park is good fun and worth a visit, however it must be remembered that they are seeking to introduce Disney to a market that isn't as familiar as the rest of the world."

And there u get good quality for your money.In SH Disneyland you pay a lot for unfriendly worker and cheap junky quality.And be prepared to line up... I mean line up like crazy. 2hours waiting is pretty normal there. In this two hours you have enough time to look on all rough and rude people there.Seriously it is a very disapointing place...

The characters, the Disney music & the smell of caramel popcorn.I did, however, get the feeling that it probably wasn't as spectacular or magical as Disney parks in other parts of the world. Two negatives were the amount of people & that most of the attractions were done in Chinese, but that is expected with the size of the attraction & the fact that it is in Shanghai.I would definitely say this is a great place to spend time at while in Shanghai.

So off we go with my best friends and 5 kids aged 4 to 14 years!We booked our 2-days tickets online on the disney website and this went very well. The website is available in English and explanations are very clear both to book tickets and to retrieve tickets at the entrance. The website is also full of useful infos on the park. After that our experience was a mix of positive and negative experiences.On the plus side :- Brand new park with top of the edge attractions (Iron and Pirates of the Caribbean are really stunning)On the negative side:- lack of signs and directions in the park- no schedule of the Characters meetings, parades and fireworks. So we had to ask all the time to know what is happening in the park... Which is really difficult as the staff does not speak English and even when we spoke to them in Mandarin, they acted as if they did not understand us as we were foreigners. What is more the staff all over the place is really not friendly, no smile, no hello....- In the various attractions everything is in Chinese with no English subtitles.In conclusion The place is lacking the Disney's Magic feeling and the Disney's friendliness. As foreigners, we did not really feel welcome!"

I just got home from a trip to China with 2 days at the Shanghai park. The Pirates ride is amazing, one of the best rides I've ever been on. Tron is really fun. The lightshow/fireworks are great, the parade was cool. The park was just missing the magic. Maybe it was the people sprinting all over the place to get ahead in lines, maybe it was the line cutting, or the hustlers selling bootleg souvenirs both inside and outside the gates. It was also not the immersive experience that you find in all of the other parks. Sure it's huge, the castle is massive, but you can see it from almost everywhere in the park. Want to feel immersed in the pirate world of Treasure Cove, don't look over the lake to the giant castle looming over everything. The new Chinese way seems to be having the biggest, the most, the longest. Shanghai Disneyland fits the bill, it's definitely the biggest, it has the longest parade, the biggest castle, but it's not the best by a long shot."

Be aware that the shows and performances are done in Mandarin.  So it is funny when Jack Sparrow is speaking Chinese.  However, if you know the story lines you can figure out what is going on.  I would definitely recommend getting to the park early to get the fast passes as the line up for rides were up to 210 minutes.  Getting to the park was very easy by subway.  There was a 50/50 split in terms of food choices between western and Asian food."
641,5.0,Nov 2017,Canada ,"Wonderful, you will definitely enjoy it!","Please wake up and go as early as possible. The park is big, buy the tickets online - it is really easy. If you can find some map online, also get to know the layout in advance and make a plan for your route according to different performances that take place at different time/place. We lost a lot of time on that, at least we saw a parade at 2 pm ;)))). I was really excited to be there though, it was purely a family trip with 4 adults and one 3 yrs old. We all enjoyed, but if we didn't have a kid, we would probably skip Winnie the Pooh, and Alice in Wonderland. The best was Pirates of the Caribbean (for adults), kids under 5 y.o. will be scared there I think. Read the rating for other attractions and choose wisely coz you'll definitely can't cover everything in one day because the queues are CRAZY - have to wait for 1 h or even 90 mins in some! Maybe you can also figure out how to get Fast pass coz it will definitely save your time. Anyway, you will definitely enjoy it! I wanna go again."
642,3.0,Jan 2018,N/A,Mediocre Disney park,"We spent 5 hours in the park on a Wednesday in January and did pretty much all the rides. We were lucky with the queues and I must admit Tron and Pirates are astoundingly good.However there just aren't enough attractions there and the park, whilst massive, feels very sparse as a result. This probably explains why on busy days the queues reach up to 3+ hours for the main rides.It lacks the charm and atmosphere of European or US parks in my opinion. Also the fact that Disney allows hawkers selling counterfeit Disney products in the queues is incredibly poor form. You spend all day being hassled. This could very easily be controlled but it isn't and it ruins the magic a little.Overall it's fun but it needs a few years to grow and improve. I wouldn't make a special trip."

However, there’s more of a Chinese feel to it than to Hong Kong Disney, that’s for sure. Main Street has been replaced by Mickey Avenue and it’s easier to find Kung Pao chicken for lunch than, say, a hot dog.Easily the best attraction, Tron ride, an exhilarating roller coaster in the park’s Tomorrowland area is the first of its kind in a Disney park. Riders race headlong into dark tunnels interspersed with shows of red, blue and yellow lights. The Pirates of the Caribbean is equally amazing and technically astonishing. Gone are the classic animatronic characters of other parks. In its place, high-definition, computer-animated trip across the ocean floor when the riders move between to real boats while an animated pirate ship battle takes place in front of them, sending animated (and real) water into the air.This isn’t Disneyland in China; it’s China’s Disneyland.

A lot of persons get food and drink removed. I don't know the detailed regulations but me and my friends showed all the food and drink we had  to speed up a search. We had a bunch of packed biscuits and cakes with filling and packed bread and packed cheese in slices.Also 4 bottles 0.5L and one 1.5L.From all the stuff only 1.5L bottle was to be removed (we just told we will dring it right away), stuff said that fine. We did as we told and took a bottle with us.In the every park toilet there is a drinking water so you can fill your empty bottles. No food was taken from us, but I saw many persons who were forced to throw away some eggs and home-made sandwiches. I spend a whole day and have ridden at almost every attraction, on some of with I ridden few times.I was using Disney Android App to get some fast track to speed few quotes.I never waited longer than 20 minutes on a ride, but maybe because I was aware of quote size because on App information and when I saw a long quote I just walk to a place where quotes were shorter at this time.

646,4.0,Jan 2018,"Sydney, Australia ",Different Disney experience ,Shanghai Disneyland is quite large with some awesome rides. (Tron and Pirates of the Caribbean are amazing!) The park is well worth the visit but ensure you use the app and get fast passes for the busy days. While there are some great rides we found that it doesn't have anywhere near the amount of attractions as Anaheim. Toy Story land opening in April will hopefully go towards helping with that. It also desperately needs a train or monorail as the distances between attractions is bordering on ridiculous. There seemed to be a number of hawkers outside and inside the park selling fake Minnie ears and key rings. I thought this was rather strange and it leads me to question the security of the park. The castle is huge and all in all we had a great time! We would definitely come back!

650,3.0,Dec 2017,Hong Kong ,4 Hours Queue and ¥50 Hot Dog,"While waiting in many of the lines at Shanghai Disney, it gave me a chance to write this review. For a lower price then Hong Kong Disneyland​, which we visited only two weeks earlier, Shanghai offers a theme park that is 3 times larger. But what about the experience?First of all we were quite surprised by the way we were let in to the park. We purchased the full price tickets at the hotel (Novotel Clover) but we were asked to pick up the tickets not at the ticket booth but from a guy waiting at the gate. There were many scuppers selling discounted tickets and memobilias at fraction of the Disney's​ prices in front of the security guards, but they do not seem to care. Perhaps Disney condone this as I wondered how middle class Chinese would be able to fill the park at the official prices they charge for entrance.  Our tickets were required to be scanned by an employee using her staff card to be validated. I suspect there is a scheme where employees are allowed to bring in their friends and relatives​ at discounted or free entry fee, and that is why we were asked not to approach the official channel for collection of our tickets. Disney must know they are losing profits on these unofficial tickets, but it does help to artificially maintain their attendance figures to justify such a huge investment.Once inside, there were quite a number of hawkers selling counterfeit Disney products, especially Minnie's head bands. In fact our shuttle bus driver from the hotel was selling the same on the bus.  There were many attendants, but all of them turn a blind eye to these activities. The crowd generally were behaving orderly, but the attendants do not seem to be maintaining order when they are needed.  It is quite common to see people pushing in front of queues, smoking, rushing to their seat or selling counterfeit products. The park has an app that is quite useful with a map and time indication of the upcoming events, shows and the the waiting time for the attractions. It also has a pre booking for fast passes of the more popular attractions, so theoretically one do not have to wait in line. When we arrived at the park just two hours after it first opened, all the fast passes for all the attractions have been completely distributed.  The waiting time for these attractions range from 2 hours to 4 hours after just two hours after opening! Despite the park opening hours are over 12 hours, it would only be sufficient for 3 popular rides in the course of the day.  Even the unpopular rides are over 60 minutes wait.  Although there is a two days admission options to give sufficient time to go through the park, there is definitely an unsustainable number of attendees inside the park for it to be enjoyable. We noted the car parking were only half full, but the park itself is over crowded. It says something about the mode of transportation most people took to get here and also their level of income. This goes back to the observation of the unofficial entrance fee to increase the attendance record.  A clear indication that people were let in at discounted or nil entry fee is that high number of hawkers selling counterfeit products. How is it possible for Hawker to pay ¥499 to get in to the park to sell products that are ¥10 each? We did not buy from the hawkers but were hoping there would be some selling food, because the price of a simple hot dog was ¥50, prices were just unrealistically high.There was no fireworks display on the day we visited due to the heavy smog and pollution. Our driver told us that air pollution is very bad in Shanghai and we would not be surprised that the fireworks get cancelled often. We could only see 500m in front of us. The details of the buildings and rides are the same if not better than those we saw in Tokyo and Hong Kong.  They were space too far apart though for our liking.  It took us at least 20 minutes to walk from the car park to the main gate.  Bigger is not always better. The real short coming of Shanghai Disney is the management.  Although we did not finish seeing, not to mention riding, the attractions, my daughter said that this is one Disneyland she would not wish to come back to."
651,4.0,Dec 2017,"Sydney, Australia ",Great fun for all ages,"Firstly, download the Disneyland app as it tells you the wait times for rides - invaluable when choosing which to go on. Lines are long but it is what we expected and use the app! Light show at the end of the night is a waste of time, so use this opportunity to go on rides as wait times fall by 90%. Tron is a must and Pirates is pretty good. Everything Disney is expensive, but again, you expect that."

And at night, they have a spectaculer fireworks show, must see!! And when i suggest you to buy 2 days entrees ticket. Because 1 day is not enough to play all the attractions. "

Very nice place, there are a couple of new rides that we tried - tron the ride, tronrealm the Chevrolet digital challenge which is an exhibit of how they perceive cars would look like and function in the future  and soaring over the horizon which is a 3d ride. They also have similar rides at tomorrow land, fantasyland, adventure isle and treasure cove with hkg disneyland. Overall great experience!"
654,3.0,Mar 2017,"Hyderabad, India ",Too crowded on weekends avoid,"Shanghai Disney land a wonderful place and is quite big. We visited with a child on a stroller; for which facilities were adequate. The problem is queues due to crowds, one would waste considerable amount of time waiting for the rides; more so for popular ones.  The only redeeming evening is the parade in the evening which is quite good and exciting to kids. Overall the experience was disappointing considering the price paid."
655,3.0,Jan 2018,"Shanghai Region, China ","What to know before you go -- Westerners, Do your homework to make it a great day!","Disneyland Shanghai is similar to all the other Disneyland Parks.  The difference is - not a lot of English.  When asking questions of staff at rides/food/directions - they can answer simple questions related to their job, but cannot have conversations.  Not a problem, unless you have a problem.  Rides are all in Chinese even when subtitles were possible.  Guest Services inside the main gate entrance – spoke excellent English and were able to help us more than any other location in the park.Fast Pass or Premier Access?Free Fast Pass is only in the morning and first come first serve – they are free but you can only scan one ride at a time and cannot do another scan till you finish first scan.  You also are tied to a certain time to enter the ride.  Can buy single fast pass for individual rides (50RMB each) or a bundle Premier Access for (270RMB) with these you can enter same fast pass line anytime!  With all – you can only ride one time – you would have to buy more passes to repeat rides. If you have the app installed you can buy more passes as you go along.  If not – you have to go back to the main guest services at the entrance gate to buy additional passes.  It was definitely worth doing the pass.  You can see wait times on the app while you are in the park. These ‘fast pass’ lines are only on 8 rides – everything else regular lines.  This is Maindland China - there are many people and lines are almost always long.Disney Apps (Disneyland Shanghai)Download before you go! We did not download and tried at the park – it did not work for both our phones (IPhone and Xiaomi).  We were told our operating systems might be the problem.  You will certainly want the Disneyland Shanghai App to buy fast passes, etc.  I can see some fun apps available that I wish I would have had at the park. Check them out and download before you go (It is easier to download apps in your home country vs. in China as internet is not always strong)Various (We visited in January 2018)Food/drink Carts were all closed by 6pm even though the park was open till 8pm.  Could only buy meals (not pretzel or popcorn, etc.) at certain restaurants after dark (which was about 5-6pm)  Very odd?  The park was very dark at night.  Hard to see signs, walkways, etc.  Not enough lights?  The lights that were on kept dimming and others were not on at all.  Not sure what was going on.  Maybe a one-off day?  "

657,3.0,Jun 2017,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates ",Soooo big,"Went there the first day they opened it, its huge, you might wanna wear your most comfortable shoes. Alot of shops and restaurants around. But before you get there you need to walk sooooooo far before reaching the entrance. "
658,5.0,Mar 2017,"Shanghai, China ",It's Disney - and they did Great for kids and adults.,"I can not say enough how good of a job they did with Disney Shanghai.  It feels like you are in Disney, because you are.  It has some similar attractions like a castle and various rides - but I have to say if you like, Disney in the US, you can't do Disney Shanghai in a day.  1. Get there early.  If you have limited time, stay in a Disney resort hotel.  2. Use fast pass.  First thing you do - get the fast pass - Tron and Soaring are a long wait and will likely be out of fast pass within a few hours of opening.  Both of these rides are well worth waiting for even without the fast pass, but if you have little kids, you will need to take turns.  (like what we did)  We didn't do roaring rapids as it was cold when we went.  Seven dwarf mine ride is great - and our kids loved the Pirates ride - (a lot more high tech and modern than the Orlando pirates ride - but don't recommend the fast pass for this ride as it is less popular)  3. food - Disney food is not cheap -but you have several good choices - we tend to try and keep the kids moving by not sitting down for a long lunch - there are several options for a quick meal - likely if you took the advice you will finish Tron around lunch time - and can grab a burger meal in tomorrow land or for a quicker bite you can get a corn dog or turkey leg along the way.  4. multiple days recommended, especially if you have kids."

Queues for each ride are pretty long so i suggest getting the “Disney Premier Access” pass, it’s basically a fastpass which can be used at anytime of the day but only once. A bit pricey but worth it!

660,3.0,Dec 2017,london ,Ok,"Stayed at Disneyland hotel, took ferry across lake and then can use fast access gate in Disney town. It was a rainy day so less crowded than it could be. Guards at gate were searching bags and confiscating  food insisting You need to buy food inside the park!! Rides are all a bit tame, definitely not white knuckle. Tron is ok. Pirates show good. Touts offering to help you to queue jump for a price, should be thrown out of the park. Queues were very short after 7pm, no queue at all for Tron at 8pm, just walked on. Did not see any Disney characters at all. Maybe they do not like rain? Fireworks and light show very good. Note that park and hotel do not accept Amex. "
661,5.0,Dec 2017,"Singapore, Singapore ",It's that Good,"Why mist Disneyland be located so far off Shanghai? Anyway, it's just me complaining when I'd to take the Metro to this magical land. The train ride was not as mystical as in Hong Kong where the latter had their own Disneyland-designed trains. Still, it was magical.Opened in 2016, the rides are all still pretty new. The cleanliness is spotless. Three points to note:-1. Visit the park on a weekday and find out when is China's school or public holidays. refrain from visiting the park then2. Download the app before flying into China. I had no opportunity to use the app as I could not download it in China. The firewall blocks literally everything from app store to Google and Facebook   3. Their live performances are only done in Mandarin. You will miss the storyline if you do not understand Mandarin but well, the light and sound are still mesmerising."
662,5.0,Dec 2017,"Shanghai, China ",Enjoyable visit with family,"We had a great visit at the Disneyland resort for two days. We visited on a Friday and Saturday, the Friday being much less frequented with people. Saturday off course was very crowded.The resort itself is quite new, it has been very well constructed. The designers have worked in detail to make this an incredible place. Safety and fire precautions are of international standard.The resort offers various Disney theme areas including Pirates of the Caribbean, Star Wars, Cinderella, Mickey Mouse, Tron etc etc.The rides are very well-made all in all. In particular the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, the “over the horizon ride”, the “seven dwarfs mine shaft” ride, the water ride were all really cool. The best ride for me was the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, which was and awesome combination of 3-D movie water ride and impressive Ship wreck scenery.Problematic is of course the long waiting times at the most popular rides. The park is very popular in China and Asia and is normally very full on the week ends. It is therefore recommended to go on Mondays and Tuesdays or Thursdays and Friday. Rides such as the Pirates of the Caribbean ride frequently show more than one and a half hours of waiting time. For families with children this may be an issue, however in China it seems not such a big problem with the locals.As always with these kind of theme parks the prices are very expensive. The two days cost us in total with hotel around 10,000 CNY for all, 4 people. We must of course say, that we did not want to wait in the long cues and subsequently paid 150 rmb per person extra to get the fast access lanes at most rides. The food in the park is of very average quality. However one must consider that there are many thousands of people that have to be fed here every day, which does not allow for a very good and high-quality dining experience. mass production. The food  that is served is very expensive, a four person hamburger and chips meal cost us close to 500rmb. A simple bread sandwich cost 55 rmb. Negative as well on the food side is, that it is all not a very healthy food. Most of it is fast food, lots of sugar, etc. This is where Disney could improve a lot, and not simply take the American standard junk meals, but try to serve a more healthier diet. As we are in China here, this should be a simple problem to solve.All in all the Disney resort is a well worth trip for the family, it is exciting, it is fun, and it is a great experience"
663,5.0,Dec 2017,"Manila, Philippines ",Great Disney Experience,"This Disney is much bigger than HK and uses a lot of new technology. 3D mapping is abundant. For the evening fireworks, the castle had really good 3D mapping though the fireworks itself wasn’t that special (HK fireworks were better).We stayed at Toy Story hotel to take advantage of the special access of hotel guests at Disneytown, which bypasses the long lines at the main gate. The access is only for tickets purchased at the hotel, not for those bought online even if you are a hotel guest. We bought a 2 day pass from the hotel, which worked out for us because it allowed us to enjoy the park at leisure. Disney is open 8am to 830pm, but if you leave the park and want to go back at night to watch the fireworks, you have to be back in by 8pm. The shuttle from Toy Story hotel to Disneytown is from 7am to 11pm, running about every 10mins.The best rides are Pirates and Tron. Seven Dwarves Mine Ride was good but not worth the long wait. We were able to do it with a 5 min wait bec we were at the Park by 830am and there were no lines. Camp Discovery is like an obstacle course and not for the feint of heart (I am afraid of heights). Another favorite is Buzz Lightyear, which was also our favorite ride in HK. An Attraction not worth the long wait is Enchanted Storybook Castle. Crystal Grotto and Soaring Over the Horizon are good but not worth lining up a long time for it. Go to the park before 10am since it seems like that is when the crowd starts.We watched all shows and Tarzan (acrobatic show) and Fandago were good, however, all shows and attractions are in Mandarin only. The Frozen sing along only works if you know Mandarin.There will also be people who cut in line so we just blocked their way and stood our ground. Overall, the park was clean but the women’s bathrooms could get a little gross, especially the stalls with floor type toilets. Mickey Ave is their version of Main Street U.S.A., and the HK version is nicer, longer with more stores for shopping. Tomorrowland looks futuristic and features Buzz, Star Wars, Tron and also a Baymax Show.For meals, we ate at Cheesecake Factory, Wolfgang Puck and Blue Frog in Disneytown (set meals for 2-3 pax are at around 300-400 rmb compared to a family meals at Disney for 320rmb). Prices come out the same or slightly higher than eating at the Park Restos but the quality is much better. The ribs and venison at Barbosa’s in the park were tough and hard to eat (my ribs with corn cost 110rmb plus 35rmb for the hot chocolate specialty drink upgrade). Flavor was nothing great either. Don’t bring in food in the park because security checks bags and confiscates food. Bottled water is ok.I would go back to this Disneyland. It’s new, big and there really are lots of things to do. Two days allowed us to do all the worthwhile and new major attractions."
664,4.0,Dec 2017,"Seoul, South Korea ",Nice addition to the Disney parks,"Shanghai Disneyland is a fun destination for families.If you want to use Fastpass, you must download the Shanghai Disneyland Application on a mobile device. We planned to get paper Fastpasses but none of the machines were available when we got there shortly after opening. The most popular attractions are the Soaring ride and Tron Lightcycles.The Tron Lightcycle ride, unique to this park, is a highlight, as is the Pirates of the Caribbean, which is very different from the versions in the United States but very good. Be warned that the ""challenge trails"" in Camp Discovery are actually quite challenging for younger kids (under 10) or those with a fear of heights.The park did seem less well lit at night than the other Disney parks we visited, and there were multiple places we saw random people selling small knockoff souvenirs like keychains after dark, something we've never seen at the other parks. But overall the ""Disney magic"" is alive and well at this park."

668,4.0,Dec 2017,"Langkawi, Malaysia ","A few hits, a few misses","The best ride in Shanghai Disneyland is the Tron Lightcycle at Tomorrowland. It was really fun and exhilarating. Since I'm a Star Wars fan, I enjoyed the Star Wars launch bay (also at Tomorrowland). The other really fun one is the Pirates of the Caribbean Battle for the Sunken Treasure. The whole thing was very real. Buzz Lightyear Planet Rescue is fun as well and you can compete against one another in a laser shootout. The Challenge trails at camp discovery is one to do if you're up for something physical. Tarzan call of the jungle is good if you're up for some acrobatic show. The misses: Give Alice in Wonderland maze a skip. Nothing like a maze. Captain Jack's Stunt Spectacular was Not to our liking. Maybe if you speak very very fluent Mandarin, then it might be to your liking. Our prowess is much lesser, sadly. The queues are generally very long which can go up to 2 hours so be prepared. "
669,5.0,Dec 2017,"Greater Sydney, Australia ",Wonderful Disneyland,This is the one place you can visit and leave your age at the entrance. Its quite a long walk from the entrance to the ticket entrance but displays of fountains and Fantasy Land in the distance make the anticipation exciting. The entrance is welcoming with perfectly manicured flowered gardens made into a face of Mickey. Must see the daytime parade with all the usual favourite characters waving and acknowledging you.Lots of eateries and we chose the Mickey hall which offers different styles of food where you dine all together after collecting you food choice. Highly recommend the Seafood Laksa which has a Mickey shaped egg on top. The best Laksa I have ever had.Much larger than the Hong Kong Disneyland with more rides being added. Pirates of the Caribbean is worth it. Disney shop is also a must. Tron is fast and exciting and have your photo taken with the bronze of Walt Disney and Mickey.

We went second week in December which meant the queues weren't too bad at all. Making use of the fast pass is a must but be quick as they go really fast. Go in the week (not Monday or Friday) for the shortest lines. I was worried there was going to be lots of line jumpers but actually we didn't encounter this at all. What we did get was a lot of attention from Chinese guests as it seemed we were the only western family in the whole place!We had passes for two days and this was just the right amount of time, even with line times of on average 10 mins per ride. As we were staying in the Disneyland hotel, we entered via a separate gate which saved loads of time lining up for security. My husband and daughter ran straight to Tron ride which they said was amazing, Be sure to head there first as it's very popular.  All in all we had  a great time, I would definitely NOT want to come here in school holidays though. Haven't been to Tokoyo or HK Disney but been to both in US and in my opinion Shanghai Disney does not compare to US Disney.... still a fun day out (crowd permitting!)"

But we did not experience anything of the sort. Myabe because it was rainy/drizzling the lines were short only about 10 minutes wait each so we can ride the attractions more than once. None of the spitting too. We recommend Tron, Fandango, Pirates  of the Caribbean, Peter Pan Flight and the Buzz lightyear ;-)"
673,4.0,Apr 2017,"Karachi, Pakistan ",Wow Experience,My favorite ride is TRON and you will find it in tomorrowland. The park is huge and difficult to cover in a single day.

674,1.0,Dec 2017,"Singapore, Singapore ",The saddest place on earth,"I have never been to a Disneyland that brought me saddess . Upon entering the happiest place on earth I was sorely disappointed. "" Main street USA "" didn't offer much options compared to Hongkong and Paris.  Food was mediocre at its best.  And don't get me started about the rides.  Tron was regarded as one of the good rides,  but unfortunately it didn't pack a punch.  Fast pass was redundant , so was the app.  Unable to grab any fast pass as the app said that ""it failed to connect"" . The only two ways to get fast pass are 1. Purchase the fastest pass - RMB 300. 2. Wait in line for the tauts to offer you a "" happy"" price to get ahead of the line.  This would set you back at RMB 50. Also noticed that while you are queuing for the rides,  you have "" private resellers "" selling "" official "" Disney merchandises at low low prices.  If you are a collector of Disney toys, you won't be awed by the selection of merchandises offered at the park .  You are much better off purchasing it down town at the flagship store.  Walking around the park,  you don't see much characters out engaging with the guests. I guess they are either hibernating or on Christmas break.  Winnie the Pooh, seemed to have lost alot of weight. His new diet is totally working!  The staff,  oh boy,  the staff!  I don't even know why they are there.  No smiles, just a straight face.  Mickey must not been paying them well.  Goofy, please look into it. The overall trip was a disappointment and I didn't even bothered taking any photos.  "
675,4.0,Dec 2017,"Sydney, Australia ",Go for the authentic Disney experience,"Having been to the Disneyland in LA once and visited the one in Tokyo multiple times, it still occurred to me that this one in Shanghai is worth a try, having been a long time resident in this city after all.Short version of my review: it is good. Good by worldwide standard of the Disneyland resorts and kids will love it.The long version:This place is as good as any Disneyland resort can get. It's big, it's clean, it's consistent with the other Disneylands in its theme and the way the place is run, there's a big beautiful castle, there are parades and stage shows, you get to meet heaps of Disney characters. Oh of course the narritaves are done in Chinese, but the translation and voice acting are so darn good.That said, the place's still a bit of work in progress. If you are a ride lover this place is a hot or miss: there are a few good rides and that's it - and all of them are packed with long queues all day and none are actually worth a 240 minutes wait (unless you are a local on a seasonal pass and just want to kill a few hours with friends).Unfortunately that means of you don't like the rides or can't beat the crowds you are done here. To beat the crowds you all need to take advantage of the FastPass system like in any other Disneylands, however the system here can get unreliable at times. Disneyland Shanghai allows (actually encourages) you to reserve the FPs from the official mobile app, but sometimes it doesn't work or only works in a fairly random fashion, while the paper one mysteriously going out of order entirely. That all be annoying for visitors who aren't tech savvy or strictly believes in the rule of first come first serve - but that seems to be tolerated like any glitchy tech advances in China - it has to be good if it uses the new tech even if it comes with some unexpected hassle.It's also worth noting that the place lacks a sister theme park like California Adventure or Disney Sea which also result in the lack of ride options.That said, a lot of rumors about this place seems to be rather unfounded. The whole place runs in a nice orderly fashion, and most visitors are very well mannered and are just having a good time just like any ordinary Disneyland goers in any other countries. There are actually affordable and decent food options just a few steps outside the park entrance so no one have to be starving during the visit without eating expensive food. Even the air pollution wasn't that bad on the city outskirts.Bit of cons: the park is too far away from the city which means a lot of travel and you'll have to watch for the last subway train (and the connecting ones) if you intend to leave right before the park closes. Getting around the area around the park is a LOT of walk and confusing because those area is probably up for future expansion any possibly a monorail. The cast are generally polite and helpful but the languages they'd use could be not the most professionally hospitable ones but the ones who do not speak Chinese probably won't notice. Also I am not sure I agree with the ways the management jack up the process of certain things once they get popular (yes I'm talking about the weekend tickets and yes the turkey leg too).Also don't visit the place on a holiday! That might sound obvious but I did made the mistake to visit on the Christmas day considering it isn't a national holiday. It turned out the tens of thousands of people  have been thinking the same.Bit of cons though."

I would really recommend the Tarzan show, you don’t need to speak any language to understand what’s going on and the dancing and acrobatics were phenomenal! The only suggestion I would make would be to add subtitles or an audio translator headset as when the shows were in mandarin (not unreasonably!) so much of if went over our heads. In Hong Kong they had a screen that didn’t distract from the show but had subtitles in English and mandarin and that is all this place needs!"
678,4.0,Dec 2017,"The Hague, The Netherlands ",Okay Visit ,"My boyfriend and I visited Disneyland on a bit of a whim as we found ourselves in Shanghai for a few days and thought it’d be a fun addition to our itinerary. I will preface to say we have been to Disney World in Orlando, but are more ride lovers than Disney lovers.For rides, there’s only one real ‘thrill’ or exciting ride- and that’s Tron. We loved this ride. We went on it when we first got to the park (1.5 hr wait) and returned when the Park was getting quieter around 7 pm and rode 2x back-to-back within 45 mins. The queues get a lot shorter after dinner time, so we found this to be a good time to revisit some of the attractions.We liked Pirates Of the Caribbean, but really did not enjoy Soaring Over the Horizon. We honestly could not figure out what it’s appeal was at all. It felt very low tech, and the graphics were all stretched out and low res. We wished we’d skipped the 1.5 hour line altogether. Expect a bit more pushing than in the States, but overall we didn’t find it all that bad. We brought in some protein bars so we’d only have to buy one meal while we were at the park, and that worked out well for us. However, we saw someone’s snacks getting taken away from them at the security check, so if you’re bringing snacks in it might be best to keep them in your coat pockets as the process through security seems to depend on the security person who’s checking your bag. You also do need to bring a passport, so be prepared for that! "

684,5.0,Dec 2017,N/A,We had a magical experience!,"When I read some of the reviews in Tripadvisor I went to Disney Shanghai with 0 expectations (specially in terms of queues and people’s behaviour). However, it surpassed all of our expectations (and more!).   Background: We went as a couple (no kids) and stayed in the Toy Story Hotel between the 20th and 23rd of December 2017 (2 days in the park + half day shopping at DisneyTown and 2 nights in the hotel)  First of all, (if you are able to) stay at the Toy Story Hotel. Not only is a delight for true Disney fans but it’s also very convenient. Buy your tickets through the hotel and you can use the separate entrance from Disney Town with no queues (I was literally the first person to enter the park one day). This would be a huge help when the park is packed. They offer shuttle bus to the park and the staff is the nicest around. To visit the park low season is always better (1 week before Christmas during mid-week turned out to be perfect - our longest queue was 30 mins and we managed to ride all attractions, see all the shows -Frozen Sing-along included haha- and take a picture with Mickey, Pluto, Santa Goofy, Daisy, Donald, Chip and Dale and Woody and Jessie). Make use of the Disney App to get FastPass and see the waiting times. It’s also handy for getting all your PhotoPass pictures.  The park itself is barely 1 year old and everything is brand new. We found most of the people to speak good English and if they didn’t they were always willing to help. Also the floor was spotless and we didn’t see any rubbish around. The toilets were really clean and always equipped with toilet paper.  Food is okay for a park and not super expensive. They have vegetarian options in the park (good veggie burger near Tron) and the pretzels from the stands are really good!  With regards to queues we only found 1 old man that tried to cut the queue with a little boy in his arms. We challenged him with a smile telling him that he had to wait and he did so without further incidents. Everyone else was respectful and did know what personal space is.   As a con I’d say that if you are looking for strong rides this isn’t your park. Tron is a good attraction but lacks speed, strength and loopings. The shows are okay but I didn’t find them spectacular. They are also lacking a night parade as when it goes dark the entertainment is non-existent.  Overall I’d definitely recommend a visit to the park if you are near Shanghai or trying to complete your Disney run. If you are coming specially for Disney Shanghai I’d wait for when they expand the park (which they will surely do in the near future!)  "
685,3.0,Dec 2017,Singapore ,Best advice to have the best experience : Stay in Disney hotel & buy premier access,"We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel, bought the park entrance tickets from the hotel concierge & had a special access for hotel guest to enter the park from a side entrance located at the end of Disneytown. When you enter the park from this side entrance, Tomorrowland is on your left. This side entrance was not congested with loads of crowd compared to the main entrance which we passed by & saw. We were 2nd in line when we arrived at the side entrance on a Wed  8.30 am (park opened at 9am on Wed). This saved us lots of waiting time as you need to go through 2 queues at the entrance, 1st at the security check then the 2nd at the park entry turnstiles. I read of people starting to queue at the main entrance as early as 5 am and complaints of Q cutting, rowdy rude behaviors etc. At the special hotel guest side entrance, no unpleasant experience at all and u get to enter the park ""first"" ""fast""We bought our premier access tickets (the whole set for the 8 most popular rides) on our mobile phone Disneyland App immediately upon entry into the park (this is the earliest possible purchase as your ticket card must be scanned/activated at the park entry turnstile & your photo taken before u can purchase the premier access. u can't buy premier access in advance). The hotel staff assisted us in downloading of the Disneyland app and scanning our tickets' QR codes into the app when we bought our tickets the night before and this app is required to buy premier access tickets, get free fast-passes & view the queue times for all rides.With this premier access we did not encounter any unpleasant experiences with any Q cutting/pushing/rude behaviors in all the popular rides and could finish all within half a day. In fact, we did most of the popular rides twice with short q times by also taking the free fast passes using the Disney mobile phone app. Worthy Notes : 1. The premier access ""physical paper"" tickets cannot be bought in the park anymore (contrary to write-ups by websites on this topic which said you can purchase them at Ave M Arcade/Mickey Arcade). Premier access tickets can only be bought on the mobile phone app.  2. Make sure your mobile phone is full charge as you will need to scan the QR code on your ticket at every fast pass entry twice for verification and get your credit card info ready on hand which is required for the mobile phone purchase. Your photo taken at the entry turnstile is also used for verification at the fast pass / premier access entry.3. One mobile phone can be used to manage all the premier accesses and fast passes if you are in a group.  4. Free fast passes can only be taken for 1 ride at a time  & u can only take another fast pass for another ride after you use up the fast pass for the current ride u have.5. Premier access entry is the same as the fast pass entry.6. For the Discovery Cove attraction, there was no premier access or fast pass and the waiting time is 2 - 3 hours long ! If you want to do this, go there first when you enter the park at opening immediately after you buy the full set of premier access. This should shorten your wait time for this attraction and since u have the premier access for the 8 popular rides, you can take your time to ride them at a relaxed pace as waiting time is only 5-10 mins even if the normal queue line wait is 75 mins to 90 mins ! 6. make sure you buy the premier access tickets immediately upon entry into the park in the morning as it may be sold out within a few hours of park opening depending on the crowd level for that day.7. Start the park as soon as it opens as some rides are not crowded with 5 mins wait even without fast passes or premier access. The Q times for the normal lines got longer and longer as the day progressed, ranging from 30 mins to 120 mins during our visit.I rate my experience in Shanghai Disneyland as very satisfactory because I could finish all the popular rides in half a day, took them more than 1 time, and did not experience any unpleasant ""ugly"" Q cutting as described by other reviewers however my overall rating for Shanghai Disneyland is average because I find that all the rides there seem to have been moderated into milder versions, the spins and swirls were less drastic and fast hence not very thrilling. Even for Tron ""THE roller coaster"" was not so scary. We did however had a reasonably enjoyable family time there."
686,5.0,Nov 2017,N/A,"Disney, with Chinese characteristics","We went on the Friday after Thanksgiving, figuring it'd be a little less busy on a weekday.  We had a great time!  We bought the premier pass - which gives you Fast Passes whenever you want for each of the rides that have them (but only one per ride.)  However, the best ride is definitely the Pirates of the Caribbean, which doesn't have a fast pass, but it's worth the wait in line! We also used the Shanghai Disney app, which tells you the wait times at each of the rides, which is very convenient.The castle is big, and since it's so new there are a lot of newer characters represented in the castle.  Tron is cool, but too short a ride to spend a long time in line for.  I was disappointed that there was no actual ride for Star Wars, but perhaps that will come in the future.  The most popular ride there is Soarin' for some reason, with wait times often 2 hours.  The only Fast Pass we didn't use was for the Roarin' Rapids, as it was a little too cold for getting wet in our opinion.The food was decent with Chinese flavors, but the lines to pay were a little chaotic (Chinese characteristics.)  Also, the walk to get to the gates of the park were pretty far.  All in all, it was a great trip.  We ended up taking the metro home and it was an easy ride.  The prices (if you've been to the U.S. parks) were cheaper.  If you love Disney, you'll love Shanghai Disneyland!"
687,5.0,Dec 2017,"Raleigh, NC ","Best Castle of all Disney Parks, Best Pirates ride too","So this trip to Shanghai Disney marked off my bucket list of having been to all of the Disney Parks worldwide.  Three standouts here worth mentioning, but as with all Disney parks everything was done well.    The Castle is the first thing to catch you eye, this is nearly a full sized castle as near as I could tell, very large and the most elaborate one from best as I could determine not having the all the castles side by side.  The only disappointment was that you could not discover much of the insides of the castle although it looked as though it was large enough to allow some reasonable exploration, perhaps these are paid for or exclusive tours, who knows.   The Pirates ride here was awesome.  Mind you I like the original Pirate of the Caribbean ride, but it is quite a bit dated at this point.  This Pirates ride seems specifically crafted from the Pirates movie, as opposed to the other way around.  There is point where it seems you go underwater and then pop back up later that is just really cool.The last unique item is the TRON ride.  The ""seats"" look like TRON cycles and move quite fast.  I didn't get to ride this one as the wait was just too long (2:30 hours), so get your Fastpass on this one if you go.  One honorable mention is their version of Soaring over California, which in their case is Soaring over like a dozen Sites of the World.  Very cool overall, but the photography was a little goofy in that anything that was vertical was highly distorted in that it ended up being curved.  Likely this is a limitation of the technology, but it detracted from the overall ""awesomeness"".  If you like theme parks and Disney parks in particular, need to try this one out."

689,5.0,Sep 2017,"Kfar Saba, Israel ",Amazing Amazing Amazing place!,"before I was only in the HK Disneyland I liked it a lot but can't compare with SH one! even tough I heard its huge - It wasn't too different for me than HK by size , but the attractions in SH are much better! The attractions are very very modern , combining new effects , new equipment thats serves a whole new different experience ! Luckily I came on a day that wasn't so busy , so we literally finished almost all the attractions in the park during the day . We came quite early - at 09:30 in the morning and the park  was still quite empty - no lines at the tickets booth at all! It was great to see it wasn't as busy and terrible as people describe it! i just think its better to not visit it during holidays - or Summer holiday otherwise it will be aa busy and terrible as people say- also better middle of the week and not weekend :)over all its an amazing place - beautiful and much better and exciting than I expected it to be! GO VISIT !"
690,5.0,Nov 2017,"Shanghai, China ",school trip with students,"a very fun day of seeing china's version of mickey and friends, great rides are scarce ( tron is awesome ) but mostly geared for families and kids under 12..still worth it and with good weather a nice way to spend a day"
691,5.0,Dec 2017,"Omaha, NE ",Beautiful Park,"We had an amazing day at Shanghai Disneyland. The queue for opening was more organized and efficient than any theme park we've been to in Asia. Be aware that children over 140 cm need an adult ticket. We didn't know this so we were sent to guest services to exchange my 10 yr old's ticket. Luckily they let us skip the queue afterwards so we could walk right in. You also need your passport unlike at the other parks. The park itself is beautiful with an amazing castle in the center. We didn't bother with renting wifi so we had no internet to use the app, but the fastpass kiosks were easy to use and allow you to pick from any of the rides not just the one they are near to. We were able to ride everything we wanted to. We got ahold of fastpasses for 4 rides before they ran out at 12. All the rides were updated compared to the ones in the states, with amazing effects (It is a new park after all). The only exception was the seven dwarves mine train which is half as long as the one in FL.If you are staying at a Disney hotel then buy your tickets from them. It will allow you to enter through Disneytown instead of the front entrance, which is a shorter wait and puts you right outside of Tomorrowland. We bought our tickets online and  weren't able to use the special entrance because of it. We loved this park and felt it really had a lot of Disney magic. Everything is in Chinese and the cast members have limited English, but truthfully we saw few westerners there so I don't expect them to cater to us. Signs are in English and we had no problem navigating the park."
692,4.0,Dec 2017,"Singapore, Singapore ",Shanghai Disneyland in December,We went on a weekday where ticket price is RMB 370 for anyone above 140cm. It will increase from next month. It was cold and wet as it was raining the whole day. The plus point of that is that most of the rides could be taken within 10 mins. But what was lacking was information on whether the fireworks display would carry on. Although we heard some announcement in Chinese that it would be held earlier. Confusing. 
693,4.0,Dec 2017,"Estero, FL ","Not the best, but totally worth a trip","We had a great time and loved the park. It's huge compared to the other parks, and seem a bit empty because it's so large. The food was different but great, and the waiting time for rides was nothing at all. (Depends on the season, I'm sure!)"
694,5.0,Dec 2017,"Orlando, FL ",No crowds mid week,"For Americans try to download and sign in to the Disney Shanghai app before you get here., otherwise you’ll have to make a new sign in with Disney. (Which is what I had to do. It’s no trouble, just annoying to have another sign in. )I bought our tickets online through the app and just showed our passports at the gate to get our tickets. Once you have your tickets, scan in your tickets in the app to get your Fast passes. You can only get one fast pass for your group and then the app tells you when you’re eligible for another fast pass. We took metro line 2 from East Nanjing road, to metro line 16, then to metro line 11 that dead ends at the Disney resort for a whopping total of 5 yuan! Definitely worth taking the metro. We arrived at 11am on Tuesday and the Soaring fast passes were all gone. We got one for the Seven Dwarfs mine train, which I recommend since it has a longer wait than most rides and is a really quick ride. Once we were in the park, we headed straight to Tron because it only had a 10 minute wait and it was soooooo much fun!The park was remarkably not crowded at all which was very surprising. My only complaint about the entire day is that there were multiple restaurants (Wandering Moon and Tribal tables) and food kiosks throughout that were closed so I’m assuming this is the low season for this park. I went on all of the rides except for Soarin’ since it was up to a 120 minute wait by the time I was over to it. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride was amazing!!! Much better than the one in Orlando. I will definitely come back to this park when I return to Shanghai!"

696,5.0,Nov 2017,"Singapore, Singapore ",November is best,"I was there in mid-November and its the best time to visit with minimal queues.  Weather was cold though.Guess i caught it at a good time as Tron in the opening hours was no queue and at midday was less than 40mins wait.The only ride i could not take was “Soaring over the Horizon” which was perpetually 90mins and i didnt get a Fastpass for it.  Should have anticipated that.  A must-go is the Pirates of Caribbean ride - technology used there is amazing !Rest of the rides were reasonable for wait times.No point waiting for the fireworks as I was told its nohing compared to Hong Kong Disneyland or Tokyo Disneyland.  Not sure why.Do download the Shanghai Disneyland app in the app store or googleplay as it shows wait times for every attraction.Camp Discovery is a challenge trail and took a while to queue but you must deposit everything at the lockers (here is another queue), but its a good attraction to give the teenage kids something different other than the typical ride."

700,3.0,Dec 2017,"Fuzhou, China ",It's a good day out,"I went with my friends as a birthday treat. As a Disney fanatic the expectations were really high, I was hoping for a similar experience to the parks in America. However, I found myself quite disappointed. The whole experience was pretty good, it was an enjoyable day out. But there were a few things that caught our attention. When we went to buy tickets, they asked us for our passports. We didn't know we had to bring them because it was not noted on the website, so we ended up having a full security check. When we entered the park, the staff seemed quite afraid to interact with foreigners which really changed the tone of the day. The biggest thing for me was that it was extremely difficult to find anyone to speak English. Granted, it is a park in China, but it is also Disney; an internationally acclaimed magical brand. The rides and the shows were all in Mandarin with no options for English version, not even headphones. Throughout the day I only saw 2 princesses (Cinderella and Snow White), Mickey once and Winnie the Pooh. The magic of Disney was lacking, and to top it off they made us pay for 'peak season' tickets, but when we got into the park we walked on all of the rides. Overall, the rides were good and it was a fun day out, just not in the traditional magical Disney way."
701,4.0,Nov 2017,"Los Angeles, CA ",Great Time if you Prepare,"We spent a full day at Shanghai Disneyland and had a wonderful time thanks to planning based on the many reviews here. Tickets and getting around: We bought our tickets and downloaded the park app from the USA before we left for China. This was critical since it meant we didn't need a local phone number to access the app or wifi.  When we got to the park we just accessed the app through a local data only SIM card we had purchased at the airport. Having the app was a huge time saver as we could register for fast passes and see how long the stand-by wait times were at each ride no matter where we were in the park. Tip: if you're using your phone to show your fast pass at the ride entrance don't turn it off after you go through. You'll need to show it again and inside the ride you may not be able to access the internet. Keep you paper tickets handy for this as well. Also, bring a battery to charge your phone so you don't have to look for outlets. Getting to and from Disneyland: we took a taxi from Pudong. 100 RMB. At 7:20 am it took almost an hour with traffic. Going back at 7:30 PM it took about 30 minutes and cost 150RMBRides: Our favorite by far was TRON. It's one of the most unique and exciting rides we have ever been on. Pirates of the Caribbean was pretty good. My wife liked the visuals and effects. Soaring was disappointing. This was surprising as many people rate it a favorite and it had the longest wait times of any ride. Luckily, we used a fast pass. Not worth waiting in line for.  Roaring rapids was our first ride of the day so the wait was short and it was fun. Tip: don't buy a poncho. Just grab one from someone coming off the ride. We had no trouble doing that. Food: We found the food we tried to be good and not too expensive by theme park standards. We loved the corn dog purchased from a cart in the Adventure Isle. We had a lunch of burgers, fries and drinks from the restaurant in Tomorrowland. 90RMB for each meal. Tip: bring empty water bottles from your hotel and just fill them up from fountains by the restrooms during the day. We went on a Friday and got to the park at about 8:15 when they started to let everyone through security and into the park. Highly recommend you get there early so you can sign up for fast passes. We only managed to sign up for two sets before they were all gone. The free ones run out quickly. You'll also be able to ride at least one or two rides before the lines get insanely long. Yes, it was crowded and the wait times for the rides were long, but plan your day and you can still have a fun time. We went in late November so the temperature was cool."
702,4.0,Nov 2017,N/A,Its Disney! it will make you smile.,"Went with some friends on a day off, and i even as an adult it was great. Now you need to keep in mind that this park is smaller than the ones in america, but this park is still great and every thing you expect from the magical world of disney. The day tickets are around 500 RMB per person which is around the £56 mark. And prices in the park aren't to bad either a little more then you would pay outside but you expect a slight increase. the park opens at 9am and coleuses at 10pm giving you plenty of time to do lots.  There is loads of shows and experices going on all day and character meet and greets. theres the princess show in front of the castle to meeting Darth Vader and of course the legendary disney parades around the park and the firework show at the very end of the day. there a good mix of rides for all ages but if you are a roller coaster lover you will be a little disappointed as there is only one, Tron. tho don't let that put you off as this ride is fantastic and the only one out of all the Disney's (or so they say). I ended up riding this coater 4 times. The other highlight for me was the Pirates of the carrabean stunt show. If you have kids or are a big kid this is a must do."
703,4.0,Oct 2017,N/A,Amazing :),"We really enjoyed visiting Disney in Shanghai for my 30th birthday. The sights and sounds were fantastic. The staff were very helpful. We enjoyed some very delicious food and drink whilst staying there. The only thing that I observed that was not so positive was the instructions for the so-called Halloween parade and fireworks. We were advised by the staff in the Toy Story hotel to queue up early for the parade and fireworks so that we would get a good view, etc.Having been to Disney in Paris and HK, as well as other theme parks around the world, we were well aware of this rule. However, when we queued up for the Halloween parade a lot of people pushed and shoved very violently, nearly causing accidents (these people were not children, probably were more like over 70 years of age!). I am aware that this is of course no reflection of Disney in Shanghai. The actual parade was terrible though, it lasted all of ten minutes and was very poor. We could not see because of people pushing and being very rude. There were only three Disney villains, despite the massive build-up that was advertised. Very disappointing for Disney.In addition, the fireworks were not all that spectacular, Disney parks around the world do a much better job in this regard. I was quite disappointed with this element of the visit, particularly because it was advertised as being a 'Halloween spooktacular'. I felt that I could have done better in my back garden. Furthermore, I disagree with the other reviews that say that this is the same size as HK Disneyland, it is probably 3 times the size! Plus you need to take into consideration that it is 1 year old and is still being built up, HK will remain the same size but Shanghai will grow and grow. Definitely worth a visit in the future again!"
704,5.0,Nov 2017,"Ottawa, Canada ",Fun time,Visited with friends.  It wasn’t that busy as it was raining.  The Tarzan show is excellent with acrobats and music.  The rides were good and they had a lot of choices for food. We had croissant sandwiches with a couple Julie and Benoit we met from Montreal. We watched the afternoon parade which was fun to watch the children’s faces as the floats went by.  We walked on to a couple of rides.  
705,3.0,Oct 2017,"Johannesburg, South Africa ",Magic relived,"On a very gloomy and coldish day, I regretted having agreed to accompany a colleague to Disneyland. It was definitely a staying indoors weather. I couldn't bail out as we had already bought tickets online. Yep, so I had no choice but to honour my promise.I wanted to wear a beautiful bright dress but it was cold and wet. This didn't deter the numbers though. They were eager beavers in long queues at the entrance. I was balled over by how swift and efficient the queues moved. I am not really sure how strict they are about the passport policy. I had my passport, but my friend had a copy on her mobile and was allowed entry. Disneyland can be easily accessed and a convenient trip using the metro and get off at... You guessed right, yep Disney Resort. It took us over 35 minutes, 13 stations later and it was only 6 RMB. A nice three minute walk from the metro station to the park.When we entered we were welcomed by a Disney parade. It felt great being transported back to my childhood. The dazzling and spectacular costumes, music and dance was beautiful.Every Princess dreams of being whisked away to a magical gorgeous castle. The grounds are well utilised and kept. There were very long queues for the rides, taking pictures and food. I think maybe there should be a limit to the daily visitors. The food was expensive as expected but not tasty. The food halls were full and dirty. With so many people, there should be someone clearing and cleaning tables as soon as people leave.The castle has shows, dancing and singing. Unfortunately the shows are in Chinese but same version as the English songs. I enjoyed the waffles though a bit dry but they were colourful and somewhat tasty. I hope in future that Dreamworks Animation allows Po (Kung Fu Panda) to visit Disneyland. Hee hee hee. Since I am in China it would have been an awesome surprise. Just my two cents worth. All in all a good day out and a new experience."

The first time, I went to visit Shanghai Disney Resort was, way before it opened to the public. It was during the construction. I couldn't go inside because of security reasons. I watched it from far away from the highway. Then finally, in May last year construction for Shanghai Disney Resort Subway Station came to an end. It is the most beautiful Subway station of Shanghai or may be in China. After that, Shanghai Disney Resort was open to the public. But only outside, including parks and Disneytown. Not the Theme Park. I still remember the first day. So many people walking peacefully outside the Theme Park. It was before the Hot, Hot, Hot Shanghai Summer. I waited almost eight years for this day. Wow! It's much much more than I expected. Shanghai Disney Resort is a Heaven on Earth. This place is full of magic. You feel... You hear... Everywhere... More like a whispering. Anything is Possible! Just like Walt Disney said, ""If you can dream it, you can do it."""

We got asked for photos ALOT from other people visiting the park which we politely adhered to.Fireworks was more of a light display/projection mapping on the walls of the castle with a few smaller fireworks particularly towards the end of the display.If your a vegetarian there isn't much available to you food wise, with no none meat options in 2 of the restaurants.

714,2.0,Nov 2017,"Dongguan, China ","Hugely disappointing, sell out or overrated ",Honestly I was expecting much more. Queuing 40 minutes for a 1 minute Tron Ride was ridiculous and most other themes were hardly worth mentioning.The Pirates of the Caribbean was good fun as was the rapids ride but either Disney Worlds are for 13 and below or this is a Disney sell out. Either way not worth the visit unless your a young family.
715,3.0,Oct 2017,"County Cork, Ireland ",Good but not for foreigners,We had a nice time at Disney but for foreigners it's hard as most things in Chinese. The parade is good & some of the pirate rides. But fir the money I would save it & go to real Florida Disney.

717,4.0,Nov 2017,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, ",Magical experience,"Took metro line 11 to get there. Bought our tickets online as cheaper. Reach there by 8 am and then join the q to get our preordered tickets. Once done, we can entered into Disneyland. Must download the Shanghai Disney Resort App to see estimated attraction wait times, make Disney Fastpass and Disney Premier Access selections, view entertainment schedules and browse interactive maps. Use the given Guidemap to help you. First we headed to Tomorrowland.  We took the TRON light cycle power run, one of the fastest coasters in the park.  If you want a milder ride, then go for Jet Packs. Not to be missed is the interactive Stitch Encounter and the Buzz Lightyear Planet Rescue.  From Tomorrowland, we headed to Fantasyland to catch the show performed live in the Storybook Castle.  Then we went for the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train ride, exciting, challenging. Then was time to q up for the live performance Frozen as one is not allowed into the show, ten minutes before showtime. Heart warming and lively entertainment. Alice in Wonderland maze caught our eyes next. We chose our own winding path through the maze to get to the Mad Hatter’s Tea Party. Next up was Treasure Cove where the ride Pirates of the Caribbean took us to join Captain Jack Sparrow on a high sea adventure where we encountered spooky skeletons, loud noises, water drop.  After that, we joined others paddling the water vessel through the waters of Treasure Cove and Q’olari river.  Remember to watch the live performance of Captain  Jack and friends at the theatre. At Adventure Isle, we took the thrilling flight around the world, Soaring Over the Horizon. We too managed two trails, Challenge and Vista. Our final stop was at Gardens of Imagination where we visited Marvel Universe, Gardens of the 12 friends and meet Mickey. Before we left, we saw the stars on parade. Truly an enjoyable and fun day.

718,5.0,Oct 2017,"Success, Australia ",Second Time A Charm,I visited Shanghai Disneyland when it opened in 2016 and had a fantastic time. I decided to return for my Birthday in 2017. I still love the Disney experience at Shanghai Disneyland. It's much better than Hong Kong and still great value. I find the park quieter than Tokyo Disney resort and the attractions just as good a year on. You only need a day and a half to see everything and if you get bored (you won't ) Disney Town offers more shops and dining. This year Shanghai Disney hosted a Halloween party and I feel they did a great job (The USA parks still nail this). I can't wait to return in a year or so as I can see Toy Story land is almost ready.
719,3.0,Nov 2017,"Jakarta, Indonesia ",Disneyland Shanghai,"I visited Disneyland on Monday and expecting short queue on the major attraction game. But apparently, the shortest queuing time is one hour. So we just visited several non queue area and did shopping. Watching one open air show. Taking picture with disney character. We bought ticket via viator. Just scan the barcode in the voucher and showing our passport in the gate. Much easier than queue in the ticket booth. The place is so huge. From parking space to the ticket gate is about 25 minutes walk."
720,5.0,Oct 2017,"Palo Alto, California, USA ",Cute disneyland with some localization,"While this is not as large the US locations, it is still enjoyable. I especially liked the localized sections such as the wall with Disney characters as the zodiac animals and the caramel corn buckets. We went during Halloween where they had trick o treating in disneydown (similar to downtown disney). Lines during weekday were not bad at all, download the app for free digital fastpasses, super convenient and easy to use (they have an english app too)"
721,5.0,Oct 2017,"Bristol, UK ",Awesome!,"We had the best day at Disney in Shanghai! Having only opened last year, the whole park seems to be hi-tech and some of the visual effects on the rides are incredible! We loved tron, the Pirates of the carribean, and soaring over the horizon. The Tarzan show was also excellent!!! The parks easy to navigate, queues weren't too bad even at the weekend, and there are free lockers to use when you can't take bags on a ride which was useful. Staff we great too, my husband left his glasses on a ride and although nobody could find them on the day they did all they could to help and we managed to pick them up the next day once they'd been located! (Thanks!) The light show at the Castle in the evening was wonderful, definitely worth staying for. The only thing we were disappointed with was that there weren't many characters around the park, Infact we only saw Mickey all day."
722,3.0,Nov 2017,"Tel Aviv, Israel ",Average but still magical,"Like every Disneyland, you feel the magic in the air the second you step inside the park.Compared to other Disneyland's, this one is lackluster and rather dull.There are very few rides and most of them are for kids.. only Tron gave me a bit if adrenaline, rest were mehh.Gotta love Mickey Mouse though.. "
723,5.0,Oct 2017,San Francisco ,Timing is everything,"I know that not everyone gets to control their vacation times but if you can, Shanghai Disneyland can be such an amazing place and not the crazy crowded experience some travelers unfortunately have. We were able to visit in the middle of the week right after the national holiday in October. We stayed at the Toy Story Hotel and arrived the day before the actual park visit. It was perfect because we found out that they sell half day tickets (after 4pm) and though they were still expensive, it was well worth it! We were able to scope out the park and get through Pirates, Peter Pan, Snow White, Tron and a few other rides with no lines! On the second day, guests of the Disney hotel get to enter through another door, so that saved a lot of time as well.  Make sure to download the Shanghai Disney app on your phone and bring a battery brick! Fast pass and wait times can all be found through the app, so that was immensely helpful.  As compared to other Disney parks these are the rides TOTALLY worth it:  Tron, Pirates, Snow White train ride, Soaring"
724,4.0,Oct 2017,"Mesa, AZ ",Castle was beautiful,"The castle is the largest castle in the Disney parks, but I was a little disappointed with the size of the park. Although it is not as expensive to get into as the other Disney parks, it didn't seem as big either."

The highlight was the Pirates of the Carribean ride.  We went on a Monday after being advised not to visit on a weekend. The wait time for rides was 30-60 minutes.There are many food options and I especially enjoyed the bakery.There are many options to purchase merchandise and they will even deliver your purchases to the gate which you can collect on your way out.It is very easy to get to by public transport. Take line 11 directly to Disneyland."
727,1.0,Nov 2017,N/A,Not worthy,Not maintained rather managed properlyFor the crowd and population it should be handled wellNeed to wait Long for every rideKids become tired and we loose the interest
728,5.0,Nov 2017,"Bedford, NH ",Fabulous,Disney did a terrific job on this park.  Lots of wide spaces for crowds. Really spectacular castle - the very best of all their parks. Cute ride through and around the castle in boats that are reminiscent of the Jungle Cruise (which they do not have). Pirates of the Caribbean has been redone in an outstanding fashion. They have used video and IMAX-type effects to really step up the entertainment value. No Haunted Mansion or Small world.  Tron looks like it might be a cool roller coaster. Star Wars exhibit was disappointing. The Eye of the Storm show would have been more fun if it had been in English but they have a routine with a wind machine in a typhoon that is VERY cool. Disney aficionados will really appreciate this park.
729,5.0,Oct 2017,"Singapore, Singapore ",Excellent 2 days at Disneyland Shanghai if you possess the know-hows!,"I read tonnes of reviews on TripAdvisor before heading to Disneyland and they've helped me enormously in planning my visit that I just have to write a comprehensive review to pay it forward. Disneyland Shanghai is definitely doable if you know how to prioritise correctly!We went during Halloween and bought the 2-day ticket (it was a Monday and Tuesday). We also decided to stay at a Disney hotel and it turned out to be the best decision as it came with some unexpected perks, and of course, it also saved us tonnes of time (there're shuttle bus/ ferry services depending on which hotel you stayed in) We've never queued for more than 30 minutes for any ride and we got on all the rides that we wanted without buying Premier Access. Here are some tips: 1) Stay at a Disney Hotel and skip the three entrance queuesHotel guests can collect your Disney tickets from the concierge and enter Disneyland from the side entrance (with virtually no queue ever throughout the 2-day we were there) instead of the main entrance. For those who are not staying at the hotels, take note that there are three queues at the entrance. First is the security check, second is the queue to get your tickets and third is the queue to get into Disneyland itself. Imagine how long this might take if you were to go on a weekend/ public holiday!BE THERE EARLY. We were in the park by 8.30am on both days and the park was already buzzing by then. 2) Download the appIt's super useful as it tells you the average waiting time. Also, as you might have known from other reviews, many of the staff are not conversant in English (they can't understand me when I asked for directions of the toilet) so having a guide on your phone will be handy. 3)Get your fastpassesFor those willing to fork out money to get fast passes, you can get Premier Access which will give you access to seven rides. Take note you cannot buy this on behalf of someone else ie. all parties must be present upon purchaseFor those NOT willing to buy the fast pass, I suggest getting a free fast pass for Soaring over the Horizon/ Seven Dwarfs Mine Train first as fastpasses for them will be gone by 10am. Take note you can only get another free fast pass after two hours.4) Itinerary with no premier accessBe there early (BEFORE 9AM). After you get your first fast pass ticket (ideally Soaring over the Horizon), your first ride should be Pirates of the Caribbean (no fast pass). And then you can watch the shows/ take photos with the characters/ visit the castle and by that time, you'd have spent two hours and hopefully can get a fast pass for another attraction. The queues for Tron/ Seven Dwarfs mine train are really short in the early morning. So take those first. Peterpan's Flight was a surprising delight. Buzz Lightyear was OK but better than Tokyo / HK disneyland in my opinion.For those with kids, the Frozen karaoke sing-along attraction had perpetually long queues (1.5 hour at least)!!! Not sure how good it is, but worth a note if your kids are obsessed with Frozen.5) FoodEat at Disneytown. The food inside the park is mediocre and expensive. There's a halal food stall at Food Republic, and Cheesecake Factory serves some mean western food and of course, cheesecake :-) 6) FireworksIf you want to take photos of the fireworks, BE THERE EARLY. The queue to watch fireworks started to form at 6pm (three hours prior) -- the best spot is of course in front of the castle. Otherwise, you can forget about getting a good spot.7) QueueingAlways remain vigilant of people trying to cut queues (be firm!!) and don't expect any personal space when queueing or watching parades (cos the concept of personal space does not exist!!!) Be careful of prams too! I almost got ran over when sitting down to watch the parade :P Overall, I feel that Shanghai disneyland is better than Hong Kong, but not Tokyo :-) Good luck and hope you'll have a magical experience as well!"
730,4.0,Oct 2017,"New York City, NY ",Good For Family!,"I have been to California, Florida, and Toyko Disney Parks. Got to say Shanghai is more suitable for family with kids. Rides are very classic, but not much excitement. Was expecting like newest roller coaster, but unfortunately the only one would be TRON； still too short not enough of FUN. Maybe just personal opinion, but Disney is still Disney, the happines place on earth!"
731,5.0,Nov 2017,South Morang ,Disneyland,Disneyland Shanghai. Excellent. Good  value for money. Probably should go with a guide. Not too many of the workers speak English. Update pass to a fast track pass to get speedier access to attractions. 
732,5.0,Nov 2017,"Jakarta, Indonesia ",A must go in Shanghai,"No matter you travel with kids or just as couple, be sure to visit Shanghai Disneyland. Enjoy the accelerating TRON, the motorbike rollercoaster, the amazing Pirates of Carribean attraction, and also the fun Peter Pan's adventure. The parade of Disney character start at 2 pm when we were there. Book a full day when in here, make sure you wait until 8 pm to see the magnificent fireworks in Disney castle."
733,4.0,Nov 2017,"Tokyo, Japan, ",Very Good - Except for Service,"Our only comparison is Tokyo Disneyland and we thought Shanghai Disneyland - all in all - was equally as good. The Pros include a very large park and an excellent selection of rides (try Tron!). The concessions are also quite good (if a bit expensive), particularly compared to the sub-par food at their Tokyo counterpart. We also really benefited from the mobile phone app, which allows you to sign up for Fastpass tickets every two hours. It also shows each ride's estimate wait time. Very very useful, though it does not work on Android.The Cons are few, but important. Our only real complaint was the service from the food vendors, which was way below our expectation for Disneyland. These services may be subcontracted out, but, bad service in any aspect of the park impacts the experience. We hope this will be addressed.Overall, a great experience!"
734,5.0,Oct 2017,N/A,Awesome day! Much better than expected!,"We visited on October 30 and 31, 2017 which were weekdays and non-holidays. There were a lot of people in the park but it never felt crowded. The longest wait we had was for ""Soaring over the Horizon"" which was 75 minutes long but was worth it. There was only one instance of queue cutting and the park was generally clean with some food wrappers littered in the queue area for Soaring over the horizon TIPS:1. Try getting your tickets from Klook we only paid about 95 usd for a 2 day weekday ticket (vs 100 usd from their website) plus we no longer have to line up for the ticket booth to get our tickets, we just lined up directly to the entrance and showed our vouchers in our phones and our passports which the Disney cast would exchange for a ticket.2. Download the shanghai Disneyland app where you can view the current wait times for the attractions and get fast passes for the popular attractions without having to line up at the fast pass booths.3. Make sure you don't mix up your tickets with anyone else's because they take a photo of you upon entry and re-check it upon re-entry or use of fast pass. They won't grant you access to the park or ride if  the photo is not yours.4. If you created a fast pass party in the app, make sure everyone in the party would get on the ride at the same time or else those who were not with the group might no longer be able to use the pass.5. Fast passes for ""Soaring over the Horizon"" runs out early so we just booked fast passes for the ride with the next to longest wait time (Tron) in the evening then went to the other attractions while waiting for our time slot.6. Utilize the single rider lane, we only had to wait for 20 minutes to get on the Pirates of the Caribbean (80 minute stand by wait time) single rider lanes are also available at Tron"
735,4.0,Nov 2017,"Los Angeles, CA ",Superclean; Short rides; Good value,"Went yesterday and the wait times were short, under 20 minutes for all but Soaring and Peter Pan.  Tron was great and we went for a second time on that and Pirates at 6:00 pm with no wait at all.  Food is expensive (US priced) but entry is very reasonable.1. Bring CNY1 coin to use the lockers2. Keep your paper ticket as you need it on a lot of rides to enter3. Fastpass does not work on the Android app (only ios Apple) so pick up Fastpass at the Guest Services located in each of the ""lands"".  4. The guards take away outside food at the security entrance but as foreigners they gave it back to us5. Restrooms and water fountains are plentiful6. Taxi from downtown was CNY135 during 8:30 am traffic and CNY116 returning with no traffic.  Took one hour/35 minutes, respectively.  Easy to get taxis both ways (no app needed).7. No English maps at entrance but we found some at the Guest Services in Tomorrowland.8. What I would think would be the rides with the longest wait times such as Tron and Pirates had the shortest times.  Rides I consider common such as Jet Packs had 60 minute wait times.  The popularity of rides are different than in the US so plan your Fastpasses accordingly.9. Cannot buy tickets on Android App by Baidu (maybe can on ios. not sure).10. Could not connect to wifi in Park - Guest Services said I needed a local China number to connect (maybe to get a confirmation code).11. Park is very small, can easily walk it twice in one day and do all the rides.  Shows are in Chinese so we skipped them.12. People well behaved, not loud or pushy."

This park is really wel spread out so feels quite big and although we queued for a lot of rides they moved quite quickly, id recommend fast passing Tron and Pirates of the Caribbean if you can. "
737,5.0,Oct 2017,"Makati, Philippines ",Happiest indeed,"2nd Disneyland I visited. In terms of rides, Shanghai DL is better than HK DL. The place is bigger too and grander. And the parade shows are amazing. But I like HK DL’s fireworks show better."
738,4.0,Oct 2017,"Zamboanga City, Philippines ",A Great Family Vacation,"My family spent 2 days in Disneyland Shanghai. The weather was cool. The park was spacious. The rides were great. We esp liked Tron (80mins wait), Seven Dwarfs Mine (50mins wait; but more thrilling than the one in Disney World), Soaring (60mins wait), and OMG.. Pirates of the Caribbean (the effects and digital tech are amazing). My little girls liked Peter Pan. The Alice in Wonderland maze is also something new. My boys loved the Star Wars interactive area. We didnt bother watching the shows since it's in Chinese. The park was fairly clean.If you manage your time well, you can get fastpass to the popular rides. The best light and fireworks show IMO.One thing that will burst your excitement are the Chinese people. They still lack discipline. They will push their way to get a good spot. Be wary of your small children as it can get crowded during the fireworks show. The thought of a stampede was really scary. They will also cut lines if given the opportunity. But I noticed that they'll back off if you stood your ground.There are two entrances to the park-- the main entrance and the one at the end of Disneytown (which leads to Tomorrowland). We walked through Disneytown and went in the back entrance of Disneyland.Wifi was nonexistent for us, we had a hard time connecting to it.But the overall experience by far outweighs the negatives. Disney magic lives on."
739,5.0,Oct 2017,"Fort Wayne, IN ",Great Experience All Around,"After reading some of the reviews on here that people are writing, I am not sure I was at the same park.  In the last 24 months our family of four has gone to every Disney Park on the planet and we really enjoyed this one.  We went here for two days on October 24th and 25th.  First off, the queues to get inside the park are crazy...but if you stay at the Toy Story Hotel you get your own entrance to the park in Disneytown and those lines are minimal.  We arrived 10 minutes before opening and were into the park minutes after they opened.  Once our tickets were scanned to get in, we were able to reserve our Fastpass for our first ride via my phone for Soaring and because the entrance through Disneytown leaves you close to Tomorrow land we headed straight for Tron first and walked right on.  I am not sure if it was because of when we went in October (Not on their holiday week), but the only rides with lines of significance was Soaring, Tron, and the Seven Dwarves ride...all others were pretty small.  The Soaring ride quickly had wait times of 75-90 minutes, but we used our first Fastpass for that which was already for like 10AM-11AM.  The Fastpasses for Soaring also sold out very quickly.  The other main rides had wait times of around an hour at peak times, far less early in the morning and at night.  We were able to ride everything multiple times, and at night even on the Seven Dwarves ride we were able to go on it over and over without any wait.I also thought the park was incredibly clean, didn't see anyone cutting in line or acting badly the entire two days I was there, though the workers were very friendly, and the queues were managed very well.  I don't know if we were just lucky or what, but everything was super efficient and run extremely well.The Pirates of the Caribbean ride is without question the best ride at any Disney park anywhere...it is the best ride I have ever been on anywhere.  It is almost worth going to the park just for that ride, and the wait times were always around 20 minutes which is nothing.  There is no Fastpass for Pirates, but you really don't need it unless you are going at a super peak time maybe.  The Tron ride is super cool as you get to be on your own motorcycle, but is over too quickly and the volume is too high in my opinion.  The Seven Dwarves ride is a lot like the others in other Disney parks, and Soaring is also cool...but the wait times are pretty bad so an early Fast Pass might be a great idea.The only negatives I see are the following.  One, we were there for two days and we ran out of things to do.  This is a good problem to have because the waits were minimal, but there aren't a lot of rides here.  There are a lot of shows, but they are all in Chinese...so we ran out of rides quickly.  The other issue was the food, I felt the food options were underwhelming...it seemed the Western tourists all headed out of the park to Disneytown Cheesecake Factory.  It would be nice if there was some better options inside of the park.  Overall though, it is a great park and if you can go at a time like we did when the waits were minimal, you will have an incredible time."

742,5.0,Oct 2017,"Nashville, TN ",We had a lot of fun,"First of all the good. Pirates, Tron, 7 Dwarves, and Soaring are awesome. We used the app to grab a fast pass for Soaring and then walked right onto Pirates. From there, we went to dwarves and then grabbed a fast pass for Tron as we jumped on Soaring.By lunchtime, we had gone on all of the big rides plus a couple others. We did the castle tour which is amazingly charming if you are a Disney Fan who hasn't lost their childlike characteristics. We re-rode Pirates, Tron, and Dwarves in the afternoon after grabbing a nap at the hotel.The fireworks show was good, but much of the park can only see part of the laser show. The not so good. The queue to get into the park is out in the open with no shelter or seats. Seriously. You build this amazing park and this is the best you can do for a first impression? And the check in process is painfully slow.The lunch was possibly the worst burger I have had in 20 years. I knew we should have walk to Barbosas. Overall. A great day for me and my Disney-loving wife. "
743,2.0,Aug 2017,"Madrid, Spain ","Access and organization really bad, the Park good","The entrance to Disneyland was a nightmare. We went 3 adults and 3 kids and there was a lot of people and nobody doing queues. It took us more than hour and a half with the kids to enter and also we thought it could be dangerous, a lot of people pushing, a lot of kids crying because of the multitude,... Once in, the queues were more than 3 hours in the 3 best attractions, so imagine, you go one day with the kids to enjoy and you have to stay full day waiting in a queue? We were very disappointed...After this, regarding the park, I liked very much and the performances were really good but in my opinion they should revise the capacity limit to enter the Park as it is expensive enough to enjoy the day with your family and not wasting your time making queues. I was expecting more from Disney regarding this.You should not go in Chinese holidays for kids although it is Monday to Friday...."

There was a lot of international food which was very nice (There is a Cheesecake Factory in Disney town) My main issue was the the lines for the big games was always super long, clearly is bc they don't have many Pirates of Caribbean TronPeter Pan The splash mountain version And another more Kids might enjoy, but not really older people since there is no much entertainment for us "
746,4.0,Oct 2017,"Shenzhen, China ",Shanghai Disneyland - Very Different from USA,"I have been to every Disney Park so far except for Paris. I grew up in Southern California, near the original Disneyland. The Shanghai Park has much wider streets, a short Main Street (called Mickey Avenue in Shanghai), and because there is so muck space, the stores feel sparsely merchandised. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride was EVERYTHING! There was a lot it was missing, like it should have had more animatronics but the technology makes the Anaheim version look pretty outdated. We rode it twice and the lines were pretty much walk-on. We went on a Wednesday, October 18 2017 and it was not busy at all. The admission was about $55 USD, a full $100 cheaper than at home in the US. We had intended to make it a 2 day trip but we were pretty much done in 1 day, even being huge avid Disney fans. The employees were friendly. The place was spotless. There was a man selling black market Minnie ears IN LINE for the storybook boats. He had a giant backpack full of them hanging on a post. They check everyone’s bags so I’m thinking he had a “helper” let him in the park. The crazy thing is, it was like he’d set up shop in line and he sold dozens and dozens of them in line. This would NEVER happen in the United States. The Disney fans would have him tossed out on his “ears”. I was infuriated, feeling like he was cheating the US (I know that’s silly of me)....There were a lot of food options and everything was very reasonably priced. The Fastpass system is advanced, and you can choose which ride to get your Fastpass on at the kiosk. So if a land has 5 rides, you can order your Fastpass for any ride in that land from one Kiosk. This is SO much better than how we do it in the US. What WE do better in the US is be friendly. The staff at Shanghai were not UNfriendly, but you didn’t feel like you’re getting a bear hug from them, either. In the US, the Cast Members are all on stage when they are in the park. I realize that the Chinese own this park 51% so maybe the Disney training isn’t as polished as it is in the US. (This was true of my Hong Kong visit as well) The lines inside were not long at all and the line to get the tickets was short as well. We were there when there was no holiday, and that’s MAJOR. Make sure you’re going when there is no Chinese holiday. Overall I’m so glad we went, but I still love my US Disneyland and Disneyworld in Orlando. "

We went on a weekday and was still crowded,  though ticket lines were short with most people having the mobile app. Fewer shows as well - another sore point being that most shows were in Chinese without any English interpretation. Eating joints are plenty - no issues there. Also accessibility is fine with a dedicated taxi line post the fireworks show.All in all,  nothing very spectacular but worth spending a day with kids. "

750,3.0,Oct 2017,"Shanghai, China ","Best Entertainment in Shanghai, but Park Overall Lacking Disney Quality","This park would clearly be a five star review except for how poorly it is operated by the Chinese management. The once beautiful entry plaza has been littered by cattle fencing to push you into a horrible main entry queue which took me 2.5 hours to get through just the bag check and turnstiles on a busy day. Be sure to bring your passport because unlike any other theme park in the world you will be demanded to show it just to enter Disneyland (this is the main reason why the line entering the park takes so long). The most irritating part of the new park atmosphere is staff who use megaphones and microphone packs to boost their voice even when you are standing two feet away from them trying to ask a question. The shows here are numerous and of the absolute best quality including the very best castle fireworks spectacular anywhere in the world. The attractions as well are top notch and very unique to Shanghai. I especially recommend Pirates of the Caribbean, Tron, and Soaring. The really bad part about waiting for these lines is that this is that Disney encourages people to pay money to cut in front of you in the line. In every other Disney park in the world FastPass is a free and fair system. Only in Shanghai does the local management value making money more than your experience."
751,5.0,Sep 2017,"Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada ",Fantastic Shanghai Disneyland,"Large beautiful clean park, great rides (Tron, 7 Dwarfs, Roaring Rapids, Pirates of the Caribbean,Soaring Over the World, Peter Pan), so much fun. Tarzan and Pirates of the Caribbean shows are excellent. Star Wars Launch Bay was very cool. The reviews said we have to buy the Premier Pass and it was outrageous 1500 Y or 300 Canadian. We stood our ground when some disrespectful people tried to push through the lineup and they backed off. We could have spent 3 whole days, instead of 2 days. We didn't want to leave. We found some incredibly nice people in China that helped us when we got on the wrong side of the subway. Also a young man came running up to us and let us know we were given the wrong info. It's true, if you are nice to people, most people are nice back to you."
752,5.0,Oct 2017,"Melbourne, Australia ","Kid's paradise, adults enjoy","We went there after the national holiday period. Therefore, reasonable number of visitors are in the park. Park is big, games are fun, performance are professional. It took us two days to play the 90% of the activities, includes watching the night firework show. Since not so many people, fast pass becomes not necessary."
753,5.0,Sep 2017,"London, UK ",Nice Disney park outside Orlando,"We went to Disney Shanghai and then Hong Kong and I must say that this is million times better than the one in Hong Kong. We saw all disney process, parade and a collected a lot of stickers. Castle was absolutely beautiful where we saw Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella. It was certainly fun day out. Stay all day there to enjoy otherwise you would get tired walking and walking."
754,5.0,Jun 2017,"Toronto, Canada ",First Disney Trip,This was the first time I have ever been to a Disney theme park. I went when the park was only 2 weeks old ( June of 2016). It was amazing!!!! I started to feel like a child again. The only thing I wished is they had more representation of Disney princesses with colour. For particular reasons I know that would never happen at Disney in China. It was super clean and the lines for all the rides were super long so I didn’t go on many of them. If you are a souvenir sucker like me then I recommend to stay away because you will want to buy everything in sight!
755,5.0,Oct 2017,"Shanghai, China ",Most Magical by Night,"My friend and I were at the park for around six hours and were surprised to find that it had been decorated for Halloween (since Chinese normally don't celebrate this holiday). I would highly recommend going on a weekday, as there are less crowds. As it was a sunny day in October, however, we still had to wait for about 45 minutes for Roaring Rapids and 30 for Soaring over the Horizon. However, there were very short lines for the other rides. Our favorites were the new Pirates of the Caribbean ride (just as fun for adults as children!) and the new Tron ride, which is the best rollercoaster by far in the park and great for adrenaline junkies. If you can, sit in the very front on the Tron ride - as you are in a crouching-forward position, there is nothing between you and the front of the coaster! (We rode Tron twice in a row!) Other attractions with less hype are also fun - we loved the Alice-in-Wonderland Maze, and the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train and Voyage to the Crystal Grotto are very cute. I'd recommend visiting Tomorrowland after dark - much more spectacular at night than during the day. Make sure and stay after dark to see the beautiful lights and the castle light up as well - it is truly magical! Most of the attractions are in Chinese - however, if you have grown up with Disney stories, this will not be a problem, and most information is bilingual throughout the park. The food is pretty expensive by China standards so make sure and bring plenty of snacks. The bathrooms are very clean."
756,5.0,Apr 2017,"Orlando, FL ",Best Disney yet!,Many things are typical Disney here but the addition of Tron and the upgrades to Pirates is well worth it alone! This place is HUGE! There is a lot to see and do! They even have a ropes course which is super fun! Everything will remind you of California or orlando but just BETTER!Disney town out front is great too with shopping and lots of food options. And wishing star park is beautiful! Take the metro here. It’s a great way to spend a day or 2 while in shanghai and you don’t have to be a kid to fall in love! This was my 2nd time here and I can’t wait to go back!

We both felt like there was something missing, but my wife was suffering from a bad chest cold which may have clouded her judgement. Highlights were the Pirates of the Caribbean, very modern with the use of large screens and digital effects, the Tron ride, the Horizon ride and the nightly light show.  Be prepared to be crowded and jostled in places but all in all a pleasant two days were spent here."
759,4.0,Oct 2017,"San Francisco, CA ",Best disney,"By far, the best Disney we have been to, granted you are still in china, and people are more rude/pushy than I’m used to, it was still the best. The rides have amazing technology compared to the older Disney’s. The park is kept very clean as well. We ended up going during a huge Chinese holiday, not knowing this when we booked it. So we were super hesitant about going. The longest line was 20min and we were able to use fast passes on their app. The PhotoPass was really cheap too! Definitely worth the extra money "
760,4.0,Sep 2017,"Andover, MA ",Not the American Disney park model - for better and worse!,"Aside from the castle in the center and the name (but not content) of a few rides and lands this park is very unique by Disney standards. I have been to Disneyland several times, Disney World over ten times (my parents live near there) and to Disney Paris once (very familiar feeling). This is nothing like any of them. If you take public transit, be prepared for a long walk to the entrance. On the negative side, the park entrance itself  is very confusing and clearly doesn't host many Americans so we were pointed in six different directions before getting where we needed to go. Luckily crowds weren't terrible and we finally got into the park. We picked up maps and the general design of hub and spokes is familiar enough. Circling around the park, the first land has a pirate theme. This is not your mother's Pirates of the Caribbean ride, though! It is well beyond that technically and immerses you in an IMAX type movie experience. We all felt the whole day was worth that one ride. Other than that lines were long (and there were lines to pick up fastpasses - not quite getting any benefit there). My daughter and friend waited two and a half hours for Tron (the sign said 90 minutes - another issue as most Disney parks overestimate the wait, not the reverse). They did say they loved it. Buzz Lightyear was the same ride but with upgraded technology which made it that much more fun. We toured the Alice in Wonderland maze based on the recent movie,not the older cartoon (more for small kids and Alice fans but we enjoyed seeing it) and playground (very cute) and the Story Boats (an enlarged version with fancy fountains of the story miniatures at other Disney parks - I liked these versions better). We ate a decent meal (American and Chinese and hybrid choices - unfortunately the dumpling bowl I got wasn't heated enough but companions enjoyed their pizzas). We'd need to go back with an earlier arrival and some better planning to get on more than this handful of rides in a day (as many have noted, the entrance fee is more reasonable than the US version). The daytime parade was good and we enjoyed a live music and dancing act in Tomorrowland Stage. Merchandise is not as ubiquitous as the American parks (the park in front of the castle is extensive with canals and plantings - reminded me of Hangzhou or Suzhou cities) and Main Street smaller. One of the nicest aspects (as in all of China) were the friendly warm people. You don't see nearly as many small children here as in the US parks or Disney Paris. There is a corresponding increase in people in their 20's and early 30's. People spoke to us, asked to take photos with us, were happy to have my mom (older and in a wheelchair) and dad talk to their children, and were very kind. Overall the park has a more open feeling (perhaps to accommodate crowds, or because all of the plants need to grow up more). And you must eat the caramel corn sold everywhere - best I have ever had (super dark coating)!"
761,5.0,Sep 2017,"Topeka, KS ",What a great day,"We went on 9/25/17 which was a rainy day - which apparently kept the locals away. Instead of 2 hour lines we were treated to walk-on for Pirates all day long and minimal waits for everything else. The park itself is large and beautiful - I didn't see much of the line-cutting that I had prepared myself for. The one thing is they definitely need to add additional rides - there was really just a handful.  As a Disneyland/Disneyworld veteran Tron was an experience knowing it is headed to Orlando soon (and that is 3 years as defined by Disney).  Fast passes act like the Disneyland MaxPass which I LOVE and it is free - no running around for paper stubs.  The PhotoPass was reasonable - ~$30 which made me hate Disney World a little for ripping you off so badly for something that could be offered so cheaply. I would skip the Mine Ride with any type of line since it is underwhelming, identical to Orlando, and for some reason the most popular ride there. Likewise Soarin' is skippable for the same reason - the ending scene with the Shanghai fly-by being the only difference - outside the unique queue and Krofft-brother like introduction that put Patrick Warburton's to shame.  They have a unique take on the Premium Mickey ice cream bars but no Dole Whips.  I recommend queueing at least an hour early (they have turnstiles outside the park leading you to security - it seemed to open about 30 minutes before the park opened - then lines queued at the gates)  Another tip - there was no 4G (I'm a Verizon customer)  and the Disney wifi was spotty outside the gate so I had momentary panic that I wouldn't be able to open my Disney App to get to the tickets.  They really didn't need the app anyway - the tickets were associated with my Passport number which you have to have."

764,5.0,Sep 2017,"Toronto, Canada ",Amazingly fun experience!,"We had an absolute blast! Leave early and take the metro which exits right by the front gates. Bring your own lunch, food inside the park is not only outrageously priced, it's also horrible and the kids didn't eat it. Thank goodness I had brought ample snacks! Get the fast pass. That is key to an enjoyable experience. Peter Pan was magical for my young daughter, Pirates was overall a hit (even with the adults) and Tron...omg Tron...do it when the sun is going down...crazy amazing. If you do not have fast pass, go in the single rider line. You don't get to sit next to your friend, but who cares!  You save a considerable amount of time.Last tip...go on a Weekday. We went on Monday and it was so manageable. We were able to go on Buzz lightyear 6 times with 0 wait!Yay Disney!"
765,4.0,Sep 2017,"Melbourne, Australia ",A fair reflection of the original ,"On a mission to visit all the Disney parks, we had to try this one. Only open just over a year and you can tell. Doesn't run quite as smooth. They do well for catering to western guests, but there is some challenges. As expected, the shows and the likes are in Mandarin, so if you are bringing kids be aware of this. The park is small and they do very well in having much of the favourites with a new spin on it. For couples in shoulder season, you only need a day. In peak or if you have kids you will need a second day. Sadly being a Tinkerbell tragic, they did not have Tink for meet and greet, however most the favourites are there. Food isn't cheap in the park as is expected. Adult ears for men are hard to find and very limited in choice. Overall a good Disney experience, hopefully they develop the same level of magic as the American versions over time. "
766,3.0,Jul 2017,"Milan, Italy ",Disney magic in a difficult reality,"This summer I completed my ""Disney Parks around the world"" tour and Shanghai Disneyland gained the last position. The park itself is amazing: huge castle, some spectacular attractions and shows (Pirates of Caribbean above all), nice theme, some great idea, like the buttons the give you if you complete the stamp passport. The ticket is also very cheap in relations with the other Disney parks.Cons: it is really a chaos! Starting from the morning, if you visit for just one day, you MUST be there one hour and a half before park opening and wait in line with everyone trying to overtake you from everywhere and in everyway. When the gates open, everyone run to the fastpass machines that is very dangerous and terrible. It is better to buy the Premier Access Set as we did that is well worth the money and is the only way to do all the attraction in one day almost without stress (it has more or less the same cost of the tickets). Shops are busy and staff don't speak a good English that is ok since you are in China... but it is very rude when it is obvious they're joking around you because they are not understanding what are you asking in English: instead of make some effort to help (like they do in Japan), they joke around you  (happened at the Pandora Store inside the park). When it is time for the night show, people push you to come as close as possible to the castle.. but just for few minutes! When you finally find a good spot, they become bored about the show and start going away regardless of you and your position. That said, I think a Disney fan need to go there anyway because the park is really beautiful. I just suggest to take with you a huge dose of patience to survive!"
767,5.0,Sep 2017,"Chengdu, China ",Excellent day!!  Beyond my expectations!,"My family is American but we have lived in China for almost 20 years!  We love all things Disney and we were so excited when Disney announced they would open a park in SH. I was so happy to visit but then I got scared!  Scared by some of the horrible reviews from friends and strangers. Mainly I was worried about the crowds and filth that many talked about!  Even though I live in China and am used to crowds, I still avoid doing lots of things on the weekends because of crowds. So, I thought SH Disney would be miserable on the weekend. Then my husband had to go to SH for business and wanted me to join him on the weekend!!  I couldn't stay away from Disney...I had to try it myself!!  And I'm so happy we did!  We had a fabulous time!!  I didn't think it was very crowded (nothing like Orlando), the people were so kind and courteous, the rides were so fun and the park was spotless!  We didn't wait more than 10-15 minutes for any attraction and we did everything!  There was not a piece of trash anywhere and the bathrooms were spotless and smelled so nice every time I went in them!  We did do our homework and got there before the park opened. We got in the bag check line before 7am. Once it opened (around 7:30am) we were through it in 10-15 minutes and then we waited another 5-10 minutes to get through the ticket line. As soon as we walked in the park, my husband and I linked our tickets on the Disney App and picked our first fast pass...Soaring. While we waiting for it we went straight to Pirates and then to Seven Dwarfs and Winnie the Pooh.  Those lines were less than 5 minutes each. Most people ran to Soaring so we went to other things and did it as a fastpass. I could go on and on but we did everything once and did Soaring and Tron twice.  It was a wonderful day!  Don't be afraid of SH Disney!  It was beautiful and magical!!  I highly recommend it!"
768,5.0,Jul 2017,"Cambridge, UK ",Fantastically Disney,"I visited Shanghai Disneyland with some friends in July 2017. The newest Disney resort in the world, and what a place! It doesn't quite have the atmospheres that Tokyo and Florida have, probably in part due to it's new-ness and the fact the paths have been built so much wider (the magic is probably lost too because of this).There is a great selection of rides, Tron is incredible, and Pirates of the Caribbean is one of the best, if not THE best water rides I've ever ridden. At night the park comes alive though, it is so well lit and is beautiful. There aren't too many rides so far, but I am sure the Walt Disney Company have many expansion plans so I look forward to revisiting in the future.The park has plenty of places to grab a bite to eat or something to drink, quite reasonably priced too (by Western standards, £1 for a bottle of water wouldn't be considered cheap by the locals!). A fair few staff spoke English and were often helpful and smiley, really liked the park, it was pretty, and as it was so new, hadn't had chance to wear down. Definitely recommended, but you wouldn't want more than a day."
769,5.0,Sep 2017,"Hamedan Province, Iran ",The most exciting part of my trip😍,"We go here on a Friday and the weather was cloudy and rainy at times. It wasn't as crowded as I thought it would be so we were sooo lucky. The longest queue we waited was 1 hour on soaring over the horizon which was definitely worth it. I had prepared myself for 2hrs long queues and bad behavior of everyone but I was surprised everything was otherwise!!! The park is very big. When I say big I mean even bigger than Paris Disneyland. But I haven't been to any American Disneylands so I can't compare shanghai Disney resort to them. Make sure you download the app and use it there to schedule your whole visit and taking all the rides since it says how long you have to wait or if you can get a FastPass for the attractions. We tried 11 attractions and all of them were awesome. The best rides were Tron, pirates of the caribbean, soaring over the horizon, roaring rapids. We were 4 families and everybody enjoyed our day from 10am to 9pm. we even got time to spare. I guess because of the rainy weather the park wasn't as crowded as always so it was the best choice of the day for us. The toilets were spotlessly clean which I did not expect them to be. Actually they were the cleanest toilets I had tried during my whole trip!! The shop keepers were too polite and smiley all the time which made us feel really well after a long time. Be prepared for long walks from one side of the park to the other side so wear your walking shoes. Bring an umbrella even if it's not rainy because the sun might hurt you at times. There are clean toilets spread all around the park so don't worry about it. The park was too clean and  you won't find any garbage anywhere on the ground at all. Do Not miss Tron, soaring over the horizon, roaring rapids and the pirate ship of caribbean at any price. Manage your time well and get your fast passes asap. At first I thought I wouldn't feel like I'm in a Disney resort but I did and it was such a nice experience. I would love to try it again and again. Don't waste your time and money buying stuff in shanghai stores since they aren't worth the money you pay and you can't really find a good quality. Go to Disneyland park instead and go on a weekday instead of weekend because of the crowd and ticket price which is lower on weekdays."

While for the rides, we didn't try all of them due to long Q. But can recommend Private of the Caribbean - search of the death jewel, a ride with fantastic graphics and 3D effects for your eyes. Thumb up for the work! Another one is the Tarzan, a classic acrobatic show special to the China not to miss.

778,3.0,Sep 2017,"Cancun, Mexico ",Crowded,The whole park is very big.. but there are just a lot of people. It makes it impossible to try some of the rides bec the waiting time was around 2hours each. They also had the disney characters' parade at 12 noon which was a really bad idea. It was to hot to handle. So we just waited for the fireworks display which was really worth it.
779,1.0,Sep 2017,"Princeton, NJ ",Keep it moving... Very disappointing,"This is the 3rd Disney resort I have visited and almost certainly the most disappointing, fortunately it was also the cheapest. Like most things in China the entry fees are determined by height so my 7 year old ended up paying about US $45 for the day and the rest of us about $65.To put it succinctly, we waited 20 mins for the parade and it was 2 trucks long, that is not a Disney parade!!! I actually feel sorry for people who have never been to any other Disney resorts because they do not know what they are missing.It rained a bit on the day we visited during the first week of September and schools were already open so it certainly kept the crowds down but despite that we had to wait 40 mins for some rides. The kids including my 7 year old loved the Tron ride and went several times, it is probably the best ride they have in my opinion and using the single rider line was definitely quicker for us.Food is generally cheaper at Disney resorts than at maybe Universal because I get the impression that Disney does not look to make money from food, that does not appear to be the case at this Disney. It was not awfully expensive by other standards but given the cost of food generally in China it could be considered expensive in this case.This Disney was more of a Six flags/theme park than a Disney experience which I normally consider to be special for younger kids.If you can go to another Disney, I would recommend that otherwise it is another ticket on the bucket list. For those that do not have a choice, by all means visit but do not use it as a baseline for what I would call a ""real Disney experience"""

783,5.0,Sep 2017,UK ,Shanghai Disneyland with small children,"My husband and I brought our 2 year old boy and 4 year old girl to Shanghai Disneyland for a day on a Friday. Our priority was for my girl to meet the princesses, for my boy to take a few kiddy rides, character phototaking and for husband to take a few major rides. Our experience was very good and we had a wonderful time.Weather was great that day. There were many people visiting although it was not a school holiday. However, the place is huge so it didn't feel crowded. Park opens at 8:30am on Fridays. We reached at 9am and it didn't take long to clear security check. By 9:30am, we were in the park. Minnie, Donald, Goofy and a few characters were already stationed at different spots near the entrance for photo taking.Our visit was very pleasant firstly because we paid for a set of premium pass for my husband so there was minimum queueing. Secondly, we also paid a bomb for my girl to have a princess makeover at the castle. The makeover did entitle us to VIP seats for the Frozen show and an exclusive session with a mystery princess so it was quite worth it if princess treatment is your thing. I did see long queues for rides and shows. I would think you won't be able to do much if  taking rides is your main thing. The only rides that my toddlers wanted to take were Dumbo and the carousel. These two rides had a 45min wait time throughout the day. No fast pass.I only experienced queue cutting once during my visit. I experienced it at Hong Kong Disneyland and Paris Disneyland as well, so with some expectation in mind, it didn't ruin my experience. Tip is to put your arms on the railing to prevent people going pass you and be more careful at turns.We booked ourselves for the Royal Banquet character dining at the last minute. It was not difficult to get reservations there. Kids loved it as they had lots of opportunities to mingle with the Disney characters. They got a lot of attention from them while we adults enjoyed the food, it was delicious. Toilets were large, clean and airy. Didn't have to wait in queue at all for toilets. Baby care room was very clean too. Getting food was easy and fast. Tables were available and that during peak lunch hour. Place is very big, so be prepared to spend a lot of time getting from point A to point B.There is a taxi stand for you to get a taxi but the queue is very long after the park closes.

789,5.0,Sep 2017,"Peoria, AZ ",It's Disney... What do you expect?,"Okay not going to lie, Shanghai Disney is probably one of the most fun I've had in a Disney Park. Mind you, I've been to California, Florida, Tokyo, and now Shanghai. The Pirates ride is by far the most immersive and is also the most popular. The next best ride I'd have to say is the Tron ride. The food is a nice mix between Western Foods and Eastern Foods. Also, this will be the most expensive trip of the day. Solely for the fact that it's Disney prices. If one can handle that, then the trip to the park is well worth it.Take line 11 to get to Shanghai Disney Resort (Shanghai Disney)."
790,1.0,May 2017,"San Francisco, CA ",Immensely disappointing,"Subway access is easy. Some of the rides are supposedly unique and fun - we were so EXHAUSTED by ""the bad"" that we were too tired to try them out. I strongly suggest that you very carefully plan your day in advance based on the attractions you want to see.The Bad1. Theres a lot of pushing and shoving and line-cutting. I witnessed one employee attempt to enforce some civility and that ended up with security and management showing up because the ""guest"" started yelling and berating the poor employee (she was crying in the end)2. FastPass doesn't work the same way - they are all within few hours of day and there are people selling FP's later in day. Also, you can pay extra to ""officially"" get an anytime FP for specific rides (its a convoluted process involving taking a photo as proof, etc)3. People smoke in plain sight4. Hawkers selling (counterfeit?) swag all over the place, especially in the lines5. Poor quality control with food - we had a churro and corndog which were so inedible (maybe it was old?) that we returned it.Wouldn't return if you paid me money."
791,1.0,Aug 2017,Singapore ,A truly terrible experience,"My wife and I brought our two kids (3 and 5) to the Hong Kong and Tokyo Disney theme parks over the past 18 months and enjoyed the visits tremendously. Little did we know what lay in store for us in Shanghai.Uncouth visitors (shouting matches and near-fights in the morning crowd even before reaching the turnstiles), terrible crowding (with queue-cutting and shoving), staff with no interest in providing any help, terrible meal options (long queues for everything unless you pay through your nose). We left after three hours. It just didn't make sense to subject ourselves to more torture.I've lived in and travelled extensively around China since the early 1990s and consider myself a savvy and relatively undemanding traveller. But Shanghai Disney was way beyond the pale. Don't go unless you want to feel like a sucker."

Pirates is very good and so is soaring plus the tarzan show and the pirates stunt show. snow whites mine is good but fast for children. Food prices were a bit steep but it is Disney. What I liked best was the character interaction they actually shook hands with the crowd during the parades. One nasty was in the Pirates queue a 3 year old sqautted and had a dump his big sister handed him some tissues and then they walked away leaving his spoil but the staff reacted quickly and cleaned up quickly but the point is his parents dint give a damn not nice at all,"

I have been to every Disney theme park and typically make a annual pilgrim to Disney World.  That being said there is 3 things you need to know about Shanghai Disneyland: Its Chinese, Tron, and Pirates of the Caribbean.  This shouldn't have to be explained, but this property is in China and geared to the Chinese population.  All of the rides are in Chinese and the staff doesn't have the best grasp of the English language.  That being said, you will have no problem getting around and having an amazing day, just like people from around the world that come to Disney World without knowing English everyday.  Number two is Tron...  The Tron ride has successful captured the world of ""Tron: Legacy"", with all the heart pounding audios (Daft Punk), mesmerizing visuals (mirrors, color neon trim, and futurist images), and tons of adrenaline punched into each ""User...""  The last point is the Pirates of the Caribbean, while this ride has been a favorite in all the Disney Parks, the imagineers have really stepped their game up here.  I don't want to spoil the details of how great this ride is, so I will just tell you, that this ride is worth the trip to Disneyland Shanghai, it might even be worth the trip  to China.  Enjoy."

I arrived late, trying to avoid the entry line since I heard peope starts q-ing early. Guess what? Nope, long line's still there. Shouting, shoving, line-cutting it's normal here. The art of line-cutting is real though, you see the most creative ways to do it here. The park is beautiful but too crowded. I loveeee theme parks, I've visited quite a lot and I go reguraly to some. My top trick is to always use the single rider line, and Disneyland closed it. I had to waste my time to stand in the line. I came at 9, and managed to went on 4 attractions only. (The park closed at 10PM and I stayed all the way)The good thing is they still open the line even at 9.38! In most park I've visited they're closing the lines as early as an hour pre-closing time. I heard the firework is good, but I was in soarin when it's showing. The store is open until 11PM if I'm not mistaken, and I love that they keep opening the doors even it's 5minutes pre-closing!In conclusion, I did not have a good time. No such thing as Disney magic happening here, not even the atmosphere, I can barely hear the music since people are constantly shouting. Food is so-so. Rides are cool but are not worth waiting in the line with such kind of shoving, pusing, etc. "
799,4.0,Aug 2017,"Emmen, The Netherlands, ",Don't go on weekend-day's. Buy the fast-pass additional 7 ride package,"You can reach the park very easy and cheap with Metro line 11 (less than CNY 7 from any metro station in Shanghai). From all Metro-lines in Shanghai, you can easy find the interchange stations to this line-11.This New park has all the latest technology attractions you can imagine, next to the standard small-children ""peter Pan"", ""Winnie the pooh"" and ""buzz lightyear"", there are the more exiting rollercoaster ""Tron"", ""seven dwarfs mine train"", and ""roaring Rappids"" and not to miss ""Soaring over the Horizon"" (news 3D fly experience, where persons are brought in the middle of half-ball-3D screen; after start you feel like hanging on hang glider with stunning views of 8 world-wonders, North pole and shanghai with latest 3 sky scraper buildings). also not to miss the  ""Pirates of the Caribbean indoor Theatre show"".So far the good news......Now the bad news:For experiencing all of the attractions, you actually need to buy Fast pass tickets set of seven tickets (entrance to the park: CNY 500; additional 7 fast pass tickets CNY 750...You can buy the fast pass set at beginning of main-street in town hall on left side of street. there is also selling points near the attractions itself. The idea of the fast pass lane is, that you have no waiting time in row, up to about 15minutes waiting time before the ride; the fast lane people are ""injected there"" into the waiting row.I had two experiences:1. weekday (Monday): all fast passes available arriving 10Am; waiting time fast pass 15 minutes; waiting time standard waiting row 60 to 120 minutes.2.weekend day (Saturday): Park is very Overcrowded. All fast passes sold out already 10AM, except ""TRON"" and non thrilling ""Winnie"",  ""Buzz"" and ""peter pan"" (they only allow certain quantities/day for not buying everybody fast pass)waiting time fast pass 15 minutes; waiting time standard waiting row 180 minutes (3 hours)!!!!!!!!!!My advise: don't go on weekend-day's with overcrowded park and waiting time 3 hours for every main attraction standard waiting-row."

The lines for the Pirates of the Caribbean was not very long. We manage to do  the whole park in one day.    The best part was the Disney shopping area outside of the park. There are shops and restaurants.  The prices here was much better than inside the park.  The Chinese food was excellent.  If we knew about this before hand we would have gone out one of the side entrances and have lunch and then return to the park. Now I can say, I've been here.Once and done!"
801,5.0,Aug 2017,"Venice, FL ",Premier Access – Shanghai Disney using FastPasses in One Day,"Shanghai Disney is another wonderful experience, but long lines to wait on attractions can dampen it.  You can remove some of that frustration by purchasing a new option called “Premier Access”.  It is a little costly, but if you really want to do Shanghai Disney in a day, it is the best way.  What you get is a packet of all the FastPasses for the park.  There are seven of them.  It is costly though at 750 RMB (CNY) or $113 USD during Peak days and 600 RMB (CNY) or $90 USD during other times.  There is no restriction on times to use the FastPasses either, but they can only be used the same day they are purchased so get there early as they a limited and the day we went they were all gone by 10:00am. You need to get the Premier Access at the park.  When you buy the packet, you have your picture taken with a cast member and need to show that picture at each attraction when you use the FastPass.  You can buy them individually too.  If you want all seven, they are only available at the Avenue M Arcade on Mickey Avenue store, which is just on the left after you enter the park.  There are other locations to buy individual ones.  I wish the Pirates of the Caribbean were a FastPass as it was the longest wait we had all day.  It was a fascinating experience though.  It took all the good things of a Disney World experience and used an IMAX concept so your boat merged with the water on the screen.The one mistake we made was after we arrived; we tried to get a FastPass first and then went back for the Premier Access.  This was not necessary as we got ALL of the FastPasses in one packet.  Not all the attractions have a FastPass option though.We took Subway Line 11 from Xujiahui all the way to the end, which is the Disney Resort.  Very easy to do.  Many of these attractions have wait lines of 120-180 minutes if you don’t have a FastPass.  I went with a co-worker on Sunday, August 27th and here are the times.  Shanghai Disney Experience- Arrived by subway at 8:05am- Security check and tickets completed by 8:30am- Went to the Seven Dwarf Miners to get a FastPass - 20 minutes (this was unnecessary)- Purchased Premier Access – 9:10am - 5 minutes (Back at the front gate)- Pirates of the Caribbean - 9:30am - 61 minutes – Not a FastPass- Roaring Rapids - 10:54am - 10 Minutes (FP)- Soaring over the Horizon - 11:19am - 35 Minutes (FP)- Sit down Lunch- Seven Dwarfs Mine Train - 12:59pm - 6 minutes (FP)- The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh - 1:11pm - 8 Minutes (FP)- Peter Pan’s Flight - 1:37pm - 7 Minutes (FP)- Crystal Grotto -1:58pm - 16 Minutes Not a FastPass- Tron Lightcycle Power Run - 2:40pm - 18 minutes (FP)- Parade – 3:30pm- Buzz Lightyear Plant Rescue - 3:58pm - 5 Minutes (FP)We did do some shopping, dinner and other things, but it made for a very relaxing day and one that we could see the entire park in one day.  I walked over 20,000 steps, but it was a delightful day rather than an exhaustive and frustrating one.  There is no place to charge your phones as you will not be able to find an outlet in the Park.  In addition, if you are a DVC member as I am, they do not give you any discounts in the shops.  I asked three managers in different stores and all of them said the DVC membership discount was not honored.Premier Access is definitely worth considering.  With this option I gave it 5 stars."
802,5.0,Aug 2017,"Adelaide, Australia ",Needs more than one day at this beautiful new Park,The journey via train was easy and the short walk to Disneyland was lovely along the lake.  We made the decision to get there about 3.00 to avoid the morning ques and this was a good and bad decision.  Good because we walked straight up to the ticket office and bought our tickets and walked straight into the 'Grand Parade' at 3.30.  Lots of people left after that and we lined up to get our 4 year old on some of the rides he desired.  Lines were about 30 min wait.  I had read about 1.30 min lines. Mickey was about 45 min but so worth the wait.  From there to Buz ride and then to Marvel where we spent a great deal of time having heaps of fun.  We had a great Chinese dinner and lined up for the night Light show over the Castle.  What an amazing show.  Saw a couple of stage shows and it was nearly time to go so that brings me to the bad.  The bad is that this is a modern super Park and you definitely need lots of time to see all of it.  I'm glad we did it the way we did as the sun was very hot and it would have been too much for our little boy to stay all day and night.  I would however stay overnight at one of the resorts and go back early the next day and head back to the city after that.We loved every second and have some magnificent photo memories.
803,1.0,Aug 2017,N/A,AVOID !!!,"The worst experience I have ever had. We spent there over 8 hours and guess, managed to see just 3 attractions. Spent most of the time on staying in queues. Waiting time to the most popular attractions ranged between 60 and 180 minutes. It was so hot (36 degrees) that children vomited and passed out in such a long queues. Absolutely nightmare. I went to the manager at the end of my stay to complain and was told that china is overcrowded in general:) truth is they sold  more tickets that they should. The only think the management care about is the profit, not the visitors` experience. We had been so excited before going there and were so disappointed after. That was a big joke for 499 RMB. Think twice before going there especially with children. That is survival camp, not amusement park."

805,4.0,Aug 2017,N/A,Disney was cool!,"As somebody who has already visited Disney World in Orlando, this Disney (land) is a good imitation.It has all the great features that are associated with Disney (shows, rides, entertainment for the family).However, the long lines are crazy. My family and I just went on two major rides during our stay at the theme park. Both times, we waited over two hours for both rides. Some people were not prepared to wait in line and just tried to push their way to the front. This created a couple of hairy situations with us telling people that they should wait in line.If this is the only exposure to Disney that you will get (i.e. don't have a Disney in your country) buy a Disney ticket. Because of extremely humid summer weather, crazy lines and the extreme wait times, I would suggest you avoid this Shanghai Disneyland, especially if you have other Disney opportunities. Moreover, the distribution of fast passes ends really early because of the volume of people. To fully enjoy the park a two-day ticket is best and avoid summer holidays."

It was still insanely crowded. The lines for the popular attractions were very long (75 minutes for Pirates of the Caribbean(which was spectacular once you actually made it through), 210 minutes for Tron, 180 for the Seven Dwarfs ride, etc etc) so you need to either be extremely patient, pay for VIP service or prioritize a couple of rides and choose not to do the rest.The parade was AMAZING! Unfortunately we couldn't stay late enough for the fireworks. The snacks are on the expensive side. There are hawkers selling lower quality merchandise and tickets for entry nearby which was a bit strange.

810,4.0,Aug 2017,"Glasgow, United Kingdom ",Visit visit with our 21 year old son ,Suggest one reads the previous excellent reviews on trip adviser. We took taxi from centre costs 140RNB. Got to park by 6.15 pm but already many there. We were unable to buy online tickets as you need Ali Pay. Ticket office to right side after security. We also bought a premier fast pass access to 7 rides once each costs 750 RNB. This is on top of ticket price of 499 RNB. It is well worth as if not the avg wait is over 2 hours for each ride. There are fast passes for about four rides but you can only book one at a time. Would suggest you go and get fast pass quickly to pirates of Caribbean and use your premier first and get back at allocated time to use fast pass. Over all because we we there early and bought premier pass it was stress free if not would have been very stressful 
811,4.0,May 2017,"Hamburg, Germany ",Still magical but Paris is better!,"Went here for a day trip with my family. Since it was a Wednesday and the weather wasn't too good, we were lucky because it was not as crowded as expected. But still crowded. It was actually very clean and organized the day I visited. No trash laying around and everything went down very civilized.The cues for all the attractions are way way too long, too many Chinese people for just a few attractions. Even the fast lane tickets were sold out all the time. It said they were for free but we actually had to pay for them at one attraction. Other fast lane tickets were for free - kind a confusing.I feel like they should add on more attractions. There is a lot of space and it is a huge location, but not so many things to do. The firework Castle show at the end of the day was lovely and made my visit 'magical'.All in all, I preferred Disneyland in Paris - but when I went there I was 6 years old... so maybe that's why."
812,2.0,Aug 2017,"Ann Arbor, MI ",Just Meh...,"We visited Shanghai Disney on a Tuesday, in August. It was incredibly hot and insanely busy. We were hoping a mid-week visit would reduce the wait times, but it didn't seem to make a difference. Our first ride of the day was Tron; we waited only 20 minutes. Then we beelined over to Pirates, but it was temporarily closed so we headed to the Fastpass machines. The line was so long we decided to skip Fastpass altogether; big mistake! All of the Fastpasses ""sold out"" before noon and wait times were 3-5 hours for rides like Soarin' and Roaring Rapids. So we rode Buzz Lightyear and then watched shows the rest of the day. We tried again for Pirates later in the afternoon, but it broke down again as we neared the boarding zone so we never got to ride it. Overall, the Park experience was just meh...We stayed at the Toy Story Hotel, which was really nice, affordable, and very close to Disney Town and the Park. Disney Town was nice as well, with a good selection of restaurants and shops. A couple of hiccups we experienced included the bus from PVG, and the unclear procedure regarding Park tickets. The advertised bus didn't seem to exist, at least at the time we were looking, so we spent an hour searching for the bus before finally giving up and cabbing (less than 100 CNY) it to the hotel. One suggestion: if you are staying at a Disney hotel, have the hotel address in Chinese as the cabbie may not understand ""Disney"". For the Park tickets, we booked them separately as we couldn't figure out how to link them with our room. After we arrived at the hotel, we took the shuttle to the Main Gate to try to get our tickets for the next day. We were told we couldn't pickup tickets that were booked for the following day and to return around 7:30 the next morning. We did as was suggested and were met with what looked like a mile long line at security. Maybe arriving at 7:00 or 6:45 would be better for an 8:00 opening. After security, we were afraid we would have to wait in another long line to pick up our tickets, but we confirmed with three different Cast Members that we could proceed directly to the turnstiles with our passports and ticket purchase confirmation, and receive our tickets there. This worked out fine for us, it just would have been nice to know in advance. Getting from the hotel to PVG was much easier as the Concierge was able arrange a cab for us.Will we visit Shanghai Disney again? Probably not. But, if we do, it'll be while school is in session, when the weather is cooler, and after doing even more prior research to make for a better experience."
813,3.0,Aug 2017,"Leeds, UK ",Overpriced but worth the visit,I was happy wandering around the park but was disappointed that the characters also wandered around! I only found Pluto all day as they were not where they should be located on the map. Mickey has his own building but we had to queue about half an hour to see him. Apparently most people go for the rides. I went on a river cruise ride which we waited for about 40 minutes for- I really enjoyed it. We walked past several lines which had queues over 2 hours- one for 3.5 hours!The parade was packed but fun to watch.The food was disgusting. You should leave the park to the Disneyland Town and then go back into the park. We went to the Cheesecake Factory on the way out and the food was amazing.You need a passport to enter the park.I arrived at around 9am and spent about 1hour queuing before entering the park.
814,3.0,Aug 2017,"Reading, UK ",Magical place but avoid in hot weather,"We booked tickets to come to Shanghai Disneyland online before we flew over to China - highly recommend booking prior to visiting as you will not have the hassle of queuing for tickets on the day, you go straight to the entrance (just make sure to remember your passport!) Make sure to arrive early as the security checks, like every reviews say, are long. We arrived for 8am and were in the park by 8:40am. Get fastpasses first!!! They do run out quickly - I would recommend checking before hand which ride you most want to go on and head over there to get your fast pass. Don't forget to download the app - it is very handy with the waiting times for rides, which are surprisingly accurate! There is also free wifi around the park.Unfortunately the day we went was the hottest day of summer (41C) but there was no way of changing the ticket as we had already booked. This is where Disney lost most of its stars for me - there is not enough indoor seating areas with air conditioning, all queues are outside to start with and with an average 40 minute waiting time for rides that is a long time to wait in the blazing sun. We wanted to have lunch inside, to cool down, but we were left wandering around trying to find a restaurant with indoor seating as majority of them only had outside seating. I think Disney could have done more to prepare for the extreme weather in Shanghai China. However, it was still a magical day! Tron is definitely the best ride you will ever go on!! I would recommend coming here just avoid going in the summer."
815,3.0,Aug 2017,N/A,Don't have high expectations,"I have been To Florida, Tokyo, and HK Disneyland and so I was excited to hear when Shanghai opened its own version touted to be the most state of the art and modern among all.What ruins the Disney experience for me when I was there are the ff:1. Staff performing during the parade looked bored and uninterested. I don't normally notice them but this one struck me so.2. Super long crowds- amazed that as early as 8 am the crowds lining to enter looks like it was midday already- imagine the crowds that ballooned during midday! I actually developed a phobia for crowds and long lines after having this experience -seriously.3. Queuing due to heavy crowds made the more popular rides unattainable unless you want to stand in the scorching sun for 3 hours to catch a 5 mins show. 4. I wish fast pass has an additional charge instead. It quickly sold out after a few hours only.5. Other rides started to look familiar and unexciting. I experienced other rides in the past with different names. Only Tron was unique.Overall, with the crowds- who always pushes and tries to cut in line, the heat and lack of other unique attractions, I would give this a miss UNLESS you are trying to complete all visits to Disneyland all over the world. At this point Universal Studios is giving them a run for their money.."
816,2.0,Aug 2017,"Istanbul, Turkey ",Spend your time somewhere else :(,"We have arrived Disneyland at 8:30 am; after 10min. walk reached to security and waited 30min. for checking bags (they took our sun spray due to danger- don't bring any pressurized cans). Afterwards waited 30min. for the main entrance (we had online tickets so saved time). First we've tried Adventure Isle but all the fastpass was finished! Unbelievable!!! It was 10:00am :( Due to high queue (150min.) skipped Soaring and waited 65min. for the Pirates of Caribbean (quite good).Around mid-day had only one activity! Luckily found fast pass for Buzz to 5pm. Had lunch at Pinocchio Villa (pizza was ok).Spent 90min. for Peter Pan (only good for children).Afterwards used fastpass (finally!!) for Buzz lazer ride (fun).Finally waited for Tron ride.Used single ride which saved 1 hour as we skipped all the line inside and ride in 1 hour. During all the time Soaring and Roaring had always around 165-195min. waiting time. So waiting time for star events are 2 to 3 hours!!! The park was full although it is Friday.People are naturally rude unfortunately and they also make the park dirty. After Tron ride, had burger at Stargazer Grill's (disgusting-please avoid). Our day ended up with Ignite the Dream at 8:30pm near the castle which was amazing. Overall very very long queues,disrespectful people,bad food with very high price. Do not waste your time if you are not a ""huge"" fan of Disney. 2 stars just for Tron ride and the night light show."
817,4.0,Oct 2016,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates ",""" Make your day Magical ! """,I was taken to this amazing Disneyland by my friends who live and work in Shanghai. Yes it was unforgettable experience for life time. But to be honest I was not fairly agree with timings here it was irritating somehow. But the end was magical ! The most important I did not regret to have been there and I recommend you to try
818,1.0,Aug 2017,Israel ,DON'T VISIT THERE!!!,"We just came back from a visit with our 3 children (ages 12,11,6).It was HORRIBLE!!!We purchased the tickets in advance to save time, but we still need to wait in front of the entrance gate for more than one hour!!!They are letting people entering Disneyland without considering the visitors experience. All the lines for the attractions was between 2-3 hours waiting!!!!I'm for sure will not let my friends visit there.Waist of time and money."
819,4.0,Jul 2017,"Dublin, Ireland ",Worth a visit if you are in Shanghai,"We have mixed feelings about this Disneyland , we did enjoy our day there but I would think one day is enough and only if you where in Shanghai .Tron , Re-worked Pirates and Soaring { both I think better than the States } are all definitely worth a visit but with nearly a 2 hour wait for each of these that's half your day gone already and if you go in Summer it is very hot and humid while queuing . We had been advised to get there early 8am if possible as the line for ticket collection and bag check can sometimes take a good hour and a half so I don't know if we were just lucky but we had got tickets and went passed security within 40 minutes . 1st stop was Tron which took between lockers and Que 2hrs 10 min , now because we had not been here before we had decided that we would Fast pass Soaring and plan our day from there how naive we were all Fast pass for every ride for the whole day had already been allocated by 10.30 am , so your only hope is to head to your nearest machine as soon as you enter and take whatever Fast pass is available { we were told that there can be hour to hour and half ques at the machines } and as you can only do one pass at a time you will be very very lucky if you can then avail of a second one. You can buy a skip the line ticket for I believe 500 yuan PP so a family of 4 is approx 280 euro plus your entrance fee that's ""crazy "" . We did not avail of this as we taught you could use there messed up Fast pass system { again we were told that these sell out really quickly so you need to buy as soon as you enter }  . We have used Fast pass plenty of times in the States and Paris with no issues on allocations , yes it might be 4 - 5 hours before you can return but you just plan your day around this . So would we recommend Disney Shanghai  ? Yes we would the Heat and the Ques make the day a little less enjoyable but we did enjoy it and that I am sure is always your main reason for going anywhere"
820,5.0,Jun 2017,"College Station, TX ",Great experience ,It was my graduation trip with friends and i had a ball here. It was easy to reach by the metro. The rides were great and so many activities and theme parks to watch. The down side was had to wait in a very long line and wait for hours in many of the attractions. Hence could not see everything. The best are the water rides. Pirates of the Caribbean themed park was the best among all. Take dry food and water if you are travelling on budget. Get the fast passes early as to save time on lines. Wear good walking shoes and mark the attractions to see on the map ahead so that you get an idea as to what all you want to see. Stay at the park until the very end. The musical show at the castle is a must see at the end of the day. 
821,3.0,Aug 2017,"Media, PA ",Nothing like the USA parks,Limited and small. May grow with time. Go to the main hotel for a great buffet lunch. Easy to get to on the subway

There is light and sound show at end of the night. You buy tickets on chinese app meitu. But need to buy 24hrs before. Use baidu translator for translation. Also can download disney app. Disney app is very helpfull
823,2.0,Jul 2017,"Pittsburgh, PA ",Shanghai Disneyland has a long way to improve this new theme park!!!,"My daughters and Ig visited Shanghai Disneyland for 2 days.  Supposed to be the happiest place on earth far from it in Shanghai.  I am from the USA and not used to the culture there but people are rude, a lot of pushing and cutting the lines.  In some of the rides like Winnie the Pooh there is a point where the gate is open which allows for random people to think they can just waltz in and cut the line.  Well it happens bc no one says anything and they get away with it.  The 2nd day we were trying to get into the line about 15 people just pushed themselves through a small space and formed another single file line in a space only wide for about 2 people!  It's not like the USA where you can book your fast passes ahead of time.  Because Shanghai is so flooded with thousands of people each day you can only book a fast pass one at a time and you have to get in line for that.  Many of times the popular rides get sold out so there are no fast passes.  It's a really messed up system at Disneyland Shanghai.  It's hot and with so many people you really need a lot of patience.  Disney town was pleasant bc there are not many people there.  If you are thinking of visiting Disneyland Shanghai you probably only need one day bc you have to be willing to get frustrated and angry at all the long lines and the cutting and rude people.  Not the happiest place on earth according to my opinion.  We went in July 2017."
824,4.0,Jan 2017,N/A,It's the best Disneyland I have been to,"I have been to Disney in many countries such as Japan, US, France and Japan. The riders here are new and use new technology. You will not see any them in other Disney in the world but their concept and stories are the same. The things you must know before go there are there are a lot of Chinese. Some riders take at least 2-3 hours and few Chinese still jump in the queue.   "
825,1.0,Aug 2017,"Klang, Malaysia ",Never again,Overrated and completely disappointing. Wait time ranges from 40 mins to 2 hours ! Not magical but dreadful !!!
826,5.0,Nov 2016,"Calgary, Canada ",Fantastic!!! Spend a day there for sure!! ,"I'd visited Shanghai in April 2016 but the park opened in June. Since it was still new everyone was going, lots of us white people too!!  I went on a day that called for rain and it was worth it. Much quieter and it didn't rain until 3pm for a little bit, perfect time to see Pirates of the Caribbean and Tarzan. Tarzan was by far my favourite because I love the music and dancing but the action show was great as well. Tron roller coaster was my favourite ride I got on 4 times!!! And would gladly have gone more. Get your first fast pass first thing so you can get all 3 throughout the day. Water rides were super fun, soaring was the same principle but different places shown in the video. The food is awful there as I was told so bring lunch and snacks. The candy shop is good at the front but that's it. Stay for the fireworks and they're always fantastic!! "
827,4.0,Jul 2017,QCPhilippines ,Tron and pirates were fantastic,The entrance was 499 yuan. The parade was wonderful.  It rained after the parade and some rides were closed. But we still got the chance to see tron. We were also able to ride the pirates of the carribean twice. I have been to Tokyo and Hongkong disney but tron and pirates offered a new kind of experience. I would have to agree that this is by far the dirtiest disney. Management should do something about it.  They do have friendly staff. I think Tron and pirates was worth the price.
828,5.0,Nov 2016,China ,Dream Park,"If you are a big fan of Disney, you should go to this new one in Shanghai. The Park in new and has lots of attractions just like the one in Orlando. Even though the park is in China, the princes and princesses are not Chinese. They are foreigners and look just like the real ones."
829,1.0,Aug 2017,"Orlando, FL ",Garbage,"I'm traveling in Asia and decided to visit this park as I had the opportunity to visit the others and this is just one year old. I have never felt so bad in a Disney property, the lines to get inside the park are huge and the security personnel is very rude. When I finally managed to get inside, 1h after the park opening hour, the fast passes were no longer available and the lines for the standby is around 165 minutes long.I strongly recommend to please do not visit any this park if you appreciate the Disney facilities as I do, otherwise you will be extremely disappointed."
830,3.0,Aug 2017,"Bangkok, Thailand ","Good, but opportunities for improvement","A mixture of some great and some poorer attractions (the best are probably Soaring over the Horizon, Tron Power Run and Pirates of the Caribbean), but all extremely crowded with very long queues, which is quite exhausting in a hot summer day. Although a fast pass for 7 attractions is really expensive (250¥ per person on top of an already expensive ticket), it is definitely worth the money - normally you wait 1-2 hours for almost all  attractions, with a fast pass you wait 5-10 minutes. Offer of food and beverages is surprisingly poor and rather expensive - take your own food and buy there just water. Alternatively, you can get some nice meals and beverages in the directly neighbouring Disney Town, especially good is Cheesecake Factory (you need to keep your Disneyland tickets to get back there).The park is easily accessible by metro line 11 or by taxi. The best is to come very early in the morning before fast passes are sold out. "
831,4.0,Aug 2017,Sweden ,Prepare your day,"As many of the reviewers mentioned here, prepare your day so you get to enjoy it despite the overwhelming number of people. Thank  you to all the tips shared by everyone here. This is our second time to visit Disney.First was during winter at the start of the school winter holiday and this time was during the hottest season in Shanghai few weeks before the start of school. So imagine the number of kids and parents visiting Disney. Some new tips useful in our recent trip:1. Arrive before 7 to avoid the crowd of people arriving from the metro. First group arrives at 7:05. 2. After the first check which is the security check, we went to get our tickets from the booth at the left side. This proved quite efficient since after getting the ticket, we had our photos taken immediately which allows us to pass thru a separate line at the far left. The other people who did not go to the ticket booth have to queue to have their photos taken upon entering Disney.  3. If you don't buy the premier pass, go to Adventure Isle to get your fast pass and then walk directly to Pirates of the Caribbean ride. By 8, we already were enjoying this ride. 4. When in groups of 2 or more, upon queuing on any line, secure your space that no one can cut. Put your hands on your waist, hold the barrier, etc. There is a lot of cutting but once you stand your ground, they will understand they cant go pass you. 5. Photo Pass - this proved very useful to us so we don't need to ask someone to take a group photo. It costs 199rmb per person but you can pay only for one person in your group. You use this to get your photos from selected rides and also from Cast members with cameras around the park. The photos will be saved in an APP you install in your phone. For rides such as Tron, Pirates, Buzz lightyear, etc all you need is to go to the photo area after you took the ride and scan the photo pass ticket for all the photos you want. They are automatically saved in the Photopass APP. Cast members can also take your photos from Mickey Avenue with the view of the Castle, Treasure Cove, etc. Photo Pass locations are in the Disney APP.Overall, we were not able to enjoy all the attractions due to long waiting time, but we still enjoyed as always a day in Disney. "
832,5.0,Jul 2017,"Scottsdale, AZ ",How to plan for this Disney ,"Ok... here's the deal with Shanghai Disney.. it can be an amazing time if done the right way....My girlfriend and I are huge Disney fans and have been to all the Disney's in the world with the exception of Disney Paris (our next trip). We visited Shanghai Disney on Saturday, July 29th in the peak of the summer months. **we are 28 years old and have no kids**The reason I'm writing this review is because the reviews we read prior to our trip were EXTREMELY helpful in our planning of our day. Hopefully, my review helps you too. - First: YOU MUST GO EARLY:Early bird gets the worm. It's China, so there are lots of other early birds, mid-day birds, and evening birds. Seriously, there are so many people there and it gets claustrophobic real quick. The trick is to get there before any of them. You won't be the first ones at the park but you'll beat the vast majority of the morning rush if you arrive anywhere between 5:00am and 5:30am. Yeah, I know that's early, but it couldn't be more worth it. Take a taxi so that you can get there early. Don't wait for the metro's earliest stop because that's when a LOT of locals show up. We arrived at 5:30am. There's a bunch of scalpers waiting throughout the walk to  the Disney security gate. Do not give any of them the time of day and walk fast to get to the gate as the other people walking are people that will be ahead of you in line. Once you arrive to the gate try and find the least crowded line. Look for lines with less women as their purses take longer to look through. We were in the top 15 people in our lane. Also, there will be a lot of people waiting already seated on the floor with food (eggs, noodles, dried fish, meat, etc.) and it's just plain gross. When it's summer, sunny, and 100 plus degrees outside the last thing you want to see, hear, and smell are eggs and fish. I've been to China 12 times and there is just no getting used to that. Leave a good amount of space between you and the people in front of you as the lines get longer the people get too close and have zero concept of personal space (a sneeze and cough on the back of my neck isn't my favorite way to start the day). The lines fill up extremely quickly. By 7:00 am the lines were so far back that we couldn't see the end of it (doesn't help that everyone has an umbrella so it's even harder to see what's going on). - Second: STAND YOUR GROUND:Yes, you got there early. Yes, you have a great spot in line. However, you're not done yet. The reviews here are absolutely correct about people and groups trying to cut you in the security line. These people pay the scalpers to walk them up to the front of the lines. Hell no. Stand your ground and put them in their place. Honestly, it blew our minds the hundreds of people that would just let them all cut without saying a word or stopping it. Well, not me. I stood there and wouldn't let them pass me. They yelled in Chinese, and I yelled back. Now, I'm a bigger guy and they wouldn't want to find themselves in a scuffle with me, but they are definitely aggressive and persistent. Regardless, DO NOT let a single person cut you no matter what they yell at you in Chinese. It's not just once. We had 6 groups attempt to cut and sent 6 groups back where they came from. Sounds terrible so far huh? Haha don't worry it's worth it. As soon as you make it through the security checkpoint you need to RUN (not walk, not jog, but RUN) to the gates to get into the actual Disneyland. Get in the furthermost left lane. ***I must add that we purchased our tickets prior online through the Shanghai Disney website and had the Shanghai Disney app downloaded and logged into show our proof of purchase (if you did this then the person who purchased the tickets online needs to be there with their passport to prove you are who you say you are)*** They open the actual gates to the park at 7:30am. - Third: BUY THE PREMIER PASSES:As soon as they give you your tickets and you walk through the gates you'll see a Mickey grass area with a ""Shanghai Disney"" above it. Don't stop to take any pictures there will be plenty of time for that later. When you walk past that turn left and you'll see staff waiting there. Tell them you are wanting to buy the premier passes. You walk inside and you pay 750 RMB for each person for 7 fast passes at any time of the day. These are even better because you don't need to go at the set fast pass times (in fact avoid those rushes all together). It cost us $220 USD for both of us on top of the cost of the general admission tickets. 10000% worth every penny!!! Honestly, if it weren't for these tickets we would not have enjoyed our time. It really is the difference. They do sell out of these tickets by 9:00am for the entire day. Don't risk it. You get fast passes for the 7 main rides with the exception of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.- Fourth: RELAX & HAVE FUN:The hard part is done! Now you can relax and focus on having fun! As soon as you get your premier passes walk directly to the Pirates of the Caribbean ride and get in line for it! We were on the first ride of the day! After that work your way around the park hitting each ride and attraction you'd like along the way. We were able to go on 10 attractions/rides by 12pm while taking our time. Totally worth it to us to not wait 2-3 hours in line for each ride. We never waited longer than 10 minutes with the premier passes. It really is a no brainer to us.- Fifth: WHAT TO BRING/FOOD CHOICES:Bring a backpack with several granola bars and protein bars to get you through the day. Do not worry about bringing water as they have cold waters throughout for 10 RMB (like $1.50 USD) each. We each had 4 since we wanted to stay hydrated in the heat. Do not eat at the park. Honestly, the food is terrible and so expensive for what you get. They don't have any regular churros but they have seafood churros.... no chance. They also don't have any pineapple Dole ice cream cups. Those two make great treats so we were disappointed with that. Save your money and appetite and head to Disneytown (located inside Disney) and go straight to the Cheesecake Factory. It is literally the exact same as it is in the states. It was amazing and the hefty American sized portions made for good quality and dependable fuel. We loved it. Trust me on this one as there are options for everyone to eat happy! - Sixth: TOP 4 BEST RIDES RANKED:4: Soaring/Alice Maze:- Pretty cool technology but it's missing some thrill. It's the same technology that they used at Universal Studios for the Simpson's ride but that was much much much better! Still visually appealing and I would recommend doing it.- We love the Alice movies and the maze was very well done. No crazy effects or anything but it was just a nice walk with beautiful bushes and flowers. We even held hands. Gross. 3: Buzz Lightyear:- This is a favorite of ours because it's interactive and includes some good old fashioned healthy competition between the girlfriend and I.  2: Pirates of the Caribbean:- Best Pirates ride we have ever been on. The new technology for this ride is honestly spectacular and there is so much attention to detail to appreciate. Visually stunning.1: Tron:- I'm a big fan of the game and Tron Legacy movie and this ride met and exceeded all my expectations! What a thrill! The sounds, sights, and motions made you feel as though you were actually on the Grid (movie reference) 😊. Honestly, the best ride I've ever been on anywhere. This is the only Tron ride in the world!!!! If you do one thing at this Disneyland this should be it!  CONCLUSION:If done the right way this Disneyland has lots to offer. It is huge and does lack that Disney magical feel, but it had its own modern feel that you can appreciate. Feels more like a Universal Studios than Disney but we still had a great time! I really hope this review was helpful for you!"
833,1.0,Jun 2017,"Miami, FL ",Ugly Land,"Worst Disneyland I've ever been to! Sadly.- Arrived to the entrance gates at 7:50. Doors were opened at 8, but we got inside only by 9:40. Imagine they check your bag twice.- Staff doesn't smile here and no one care about anything. They just want to resign today or tomorrow.- Queue of some rides was exceeding 300 minutes of wait time.- Only 1 Fast Pass at a time. And by 12pm all of them taken.- As a snack through the park they sell only popcorn and sausages. To drink is water and Coca-Cola. Poor.- Entertainment show ""Tarzan"" was so boring that I was falling asleep right there in front.- Timing of shows not flexible at all.- They don't have any crowd management.- Luck of decorations in the park itself. No attention to details.- There no true Disney spirit. Felt like it's just a fake park that pretends to be world famous.- Should mention that price of the tickets are really high. And they let go all people to the park without any limit. Don't forget to take your passport otherwise you cannot enter inside.- Good point we were lucky to try Tron and Pirates of the Caribbeans. Excellent quality of rides. And fireworks are impressive as usual. Good spots were taken 2 hours before.Conclusion: don't waste your time and money, there are better places to be. I will not be back even if someone give me $$. Let Chinese people enjoy something from the West even when it's made in China."
834,4.0,May 2017,N/A,A good day trip,"IF you are a Disney fan, this is a must see, but it's not really worth the resort stay.  DEFINITELY take the subway to get there and NOT a cab.  Traffic is bad and the fare one way was almost the cost of admission.Great for tourists who want a taste of the familiar and a day of fun.The park-specific rides were amazing, and the different worlds made sense with an overall theme. The castle and Fantasy Land were my favorite to walk through, the Pirates o.t. Caribbean ride was AMAZING!, but it was kind of weird having a Marvel character meet and greet in China, especially with Captain America.  Great day trip for couples and family."
835,5.0,May 2017,N/A,Loved it!,"I've spent a good deal of time in China and visited a variety of other theme parks, Disneyland takes the cake for best managed, most effectively designed, and ultimately retaining a significant level of quality in themed entertainment. I was there to attend the birthday party of a friend. As others have noted, the park is frequently busy (which again, I attribute to the quality of its offering), but we were fortunate to snag a ""birthday button"" which gave the group front of line privileges for the whole day. It frankly made the experience excellent. There is no drinking in the park, but if you head to the little village adjacent to the park there is a Cheesecake Factory and Bluefrog which both offer acceptable food and drinks. You can sneak in and out of the park whenever you feel the urge. Be careful not to drink too much, however, as you can lose your ride privileges.Great place for both adults and kids."

You and your friends and your kids can have a lot of fun and a good time there. Classic attractions are there as well as the new ones (TRON, Marvel, Star Wars etc.), Plenty of space, safe and professionally run. It meets the Disney Standard high five (I have already visited the ones in Orlando and in Anaheim as well as the one in Tokyo). "
837,3.0,Jan 2017,"Cologne, Germany ",Is cool there but super packed,We went there for visit the newest Disneyland and all looks good but there went so many ppl also because of Chinese New Year for many rides you need to wait 2 hours or more luckily we get there early and grabbed some fast passes but still super packed everywhere even the restaurants and show events. You can see everything is new and clean. The rides there are okay and makes fun sometimes you can see Pluto or goofy on the streets walk around so was quite a fun day the fireworks at the end of the was nice and professional. 
838,4.0,Jul 2017,"Sedgwick, Australia ","Busy, hot but worth the effort","We came during the domestic school Holidays and had taken everyone's suggestions of an early start, we were there by 7.30am and the queues were already horrendous. It took us until 9am to get into the park and we managed to get fast passes for two rides as all others were booked out before 11am. The queues ranged from 45 mins to 3.5hrs for standby. In the Shanghai heat the waiting can get a bit tedious particularly with the line cutters but we found that if we stood our ground it was minimal. The best food we found at the park was the turkey legs, but you will have to queue for that as well! And the food in the area near the buzz light year ride was ok, with fast service and air conditioning. Amazingly not all food areas are air conditioned. Toilets are located throughout the park and were clean and tidy. It was easy to get to photos taken with characters and meet and greet, during the day as this didn't seem to be a priority for the locals. Get positions for both the parade and the nighttime fun early as the crowds build quickly for these events."
839,5.0,Jul 2017,"Houston, TX ","Be there very very early, expect huge crowds, and enjoy the rides with fast passes.","Be there very very early, expect huge crowds, and enjoy the rides with fast passes.Imagine the entire US population live within three hours (by car or by train) of Orlando Disneyland, how crowded do you think Magic Kingdom will be? Well, that's the reality for Disneyland Shanghai. Rumor has it that the limit is 100,000 visitors per day, and Disney will stop selling ticket for that day if it reaches the limit. But that is just a rumor. There are two ways to avoid huge crowds, come during low season when kids are in school or come very early in the morning.We went there during summer vacation in July 2017, two families, 4 adults and 4 kids ranging from 1.5 years to 6 years of age. Although it's very hot and very crowded, we did the homework and enjoyed our two-day visit. I've been to Disney World in Orlando at least 4 times in the last 15 years and enjoyed those visits, but most rides in Orlando are old. You have to come to Shanghai Disneyland to experience the newest ride and technology.Homework:1. Buy tickets online in advance2. Download Disney Shanghai App and memorize the location of major attractions, learn the height limit for each ride if you have young children. You can also check wait time, fast pass status3. Book a hotel close to the park, or Airbnb for the days you plan to visit the parkHow to get in:1. During summer peak times, arrive by 6:30 AM at the security check point, find the line with the narrowest two metal barricade. If you arrive after 7AM you won't be able to see the barricade. The first metro arrives around 7:05AM, that's when the huge crowds hit. If you arrive after 7:05, you probably won't be able to get in before 9AM. If you arrive after 9AM, you can probably get in easily through security and ticket check point, because everyone is already in the park.2. Security check starts around 7:00AM, after you get through security check, RUN straight ahead then go to the second line to get your ticket and to get in. Again, find the narrowest and shortest line, they are usually at the far left or far right side. You'll get your picture taken and your tickets, keep the tickets as you'll need them to get the free fast passes inside.3. Although the park opens at 8:00AM according to the website, they'll let people in around 7:15AM. If you arrive early, you'll be in the park about that time. How to get fast passes:1. If you only have one day for the park and you want to hit all major attractions, get the Premier fast pass package. It cost 600 RMB ($85 USD) per set for 7 fast passes and it will save you a lot of time and energy. You can also buy the fast pass for a single ride in the store next to the ride, it cost 150 RMB ($22 USD) per pass. Since we planned a two-day visit, we did not buy any fast passes.2. If you want to get free fast passes, you will have to be fast and plan ahead. a. Soaring over the horizon-most popular as far as fast pass goes and the ride was truly amazing, fast pass usually run out by 9AMb. Roaring Rapids, I was hoping for a more thrilling ride, somewhat over-rated. fast pass run out by 12PMYou can get the fast passes for these two rides across from the Roaring Rapids entrance, very very long line.c. TRON Lightcycle Power Run, my favorite ride in the whole park, fast pass run out about 12PMd. Buzz lightyear planet rescue, kids love itYou can get the fast passes for these two rides close to the entrance of Buzz lightyear ride, it's under a green blueish shaded area with a long linee. Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, fantastic ride, even my 3 year old wants to do it again, fast pass run out by 10-11AMd. Winnie the Pooh, kids enjoyed itf. Peter Pan's Flight kids love itYou can get the fast passes for these three rides across from the Seven Dwarfs Mine train entranceFor each park ticket, you can get one fast pass every two hours. For example, if you get the fast pass for Soaring at 7:30, you can get another one for TRON at 9:30, and the third one at 11:30 AM. As soon as you enter the park, you'll see people running towards the right side of the park, they are running to get the fast pass for Soaring. However, if you enter the park after 9 AM, Soaring fast passes won't be available any more. When you get to the fast pass station, scan your park ticket, you'll have the option to choose which fast pass to get. At the bottom of the fast pass, it tells you when you can get another one. New rule requires all members of your party to be present at the fast pass station to get the passes, you cannot get the fast passes for others. But there are still many scalps cutting lines and trying to get fast passes for other people who paid them, unfortunately.Pirates of the Caribbean Battle for the Sunken Treasure is the ride you must try. The wait was only about 10 minutes before 8 AM in the morning. Go there immediately after you get your first fast pass (Soaring). I would suggest find a restaurant to eat and rest during 12-4 PM to avoid walking under the sun and to charge your phone. Mickey & Pals Market Cafe close to the Carousel is a good option, as you can just walk out and see the parade at 3:30 PM. If you don't want Chinese food, Stargazer Grill next to Tron is another option.The wait time for Winnie the Pooh, Peter Pan's Flight, and Buzz lightyear were about 30-40 minutes in the morning before 9 AM, so we did not get fast passes for those rides.We saw four shows: Captain Jack's Stunt and Tarzan were both great! You should be there about 15-20 minutes before the show starts. Frozen show was a short one, it's basically a 6-song-KTV session, but kids love it. The evening Ignite the Dream light show was spectacular, find a spot where you can see the entire castle.Remember: Plan ahead and be there early!"
840,5.0,Aug 2016,"Melbourne, Australia ","Great park, just plan your day!","Yes, the crowds are huge, but so is the park itself in order to accommodate many people. Just plan your day and your fastpass use ahead of time as you would with any Disney park. I did appreciate the size but on a boiling hot day it was exhausting getting around. Not that that stopped me wondering around looking for my magical passport stamps... For a new Disney park the variety in attractions is really great here. Tron and Pirates are amazing - so sleek and modern. Loved that there was a whole pirate themed land (Treasure Cove). Enjoyed the cultural touches like the Garden of Twelve Friends. Just be aware of people trying to cut in line sometimes and if it bothers you just stand your ground. I preferred Tokyo Disney Sea but Shanghai was still awesome! The only Disney I probably wouldn't give 5 stars to is Paris."
841,4.0,Jul 2017,Japan ,Pirates ride is spectacular,"I think Shanghai Disneyland is cool. It is not cute nor magical or dreamy, it is just cool. The technology used for the rides, shows and mapping are all advanced and just awesome especially the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.It is a very huge park but strangely, the restaurants and cafes are too small to fit a large amount of visitors. Food is good though.Service can be either really good or pure crap depending on who you meet. The visitors there will almost definitely piss you off one way or another so it's best to enter the park with an open mind and a high tolerance level. The park is surprisingly clean despite the horrid reviews I have read here. We arrived at about 10am on a very hot and sunny Sunday and the queues for the tickets and entrance were quick. However, there were no more fast passes left. The line for pirates took us about an hour which is pretty normal for Disneyland.Will we come back? Yes :-) "
842,5.0,Nov 2016,"Mumbai, India ",Tooo much fun,If you love amusement parks you will love this place. They have a hotel too where u could stay. Wait for the evening fireworks. The best is pirates of Caribbean.
843,1.0,Jul 2017,N/A,Not that magical,"Imagine yourself waiting in line on the surface of the sun - not that magical! Arrived at park opening and spent seventy minutes waiting in line for security and ticket check. They could take a few lessons from Orlando in how to run efficiently, so your guests aren't totally frustrated by the time they enter the park. Some shade in these areas would help. The park lacks that magic feeling of other Disney parks. "
844,4.0,Jul 2017,"Singapore, Singapore ",Hot visit,"Visited the attraction recently. Super hot weather and the checks from 1st round till ticket check to enter the attraction, it took abt 2 hours. Even before the attraction open, the queue is like mad. However what u see in the attraction is wortg it except more queues, some highlights take even have queues till night. So a lot of time is spent on the queue. Will suggest to visit during the low session."
845,4.0,Jul 2017,"Chicago, IL ",A lot of issues - but still a lot of fun.,"I am writing this review hopefully to help others decide whether this place is for them or not, and I am so thankful to all the helpful reviews I read that I want to pay it forward.We read many reviews before our trip to Shanghai Disneyland and we were so discouraged that my family of 5 including 3 teenage children almost didn't go. We had been looking forward to going there so much that we decided to go after all with an open mind and a plan.On the day of our visit the park opened at 8am. We arrived around 7:15 by taxi who was not allowed to  drop us off anywhere near the entrance, so we walked 15 min in searing heat. We did see many of the fastpass scalpers along the way, but we ignored them and kept walking. There are two lines, one for security and the second to get in to the park. They are both excruciatingly slow, but in all honesty the security seemed very thorough and I'm not really sure if they will ever be able to speed that up. Their method of checking tickets is also highly inefficient, even though we had pre-ordered tickets online. Again this may just be how they do things in China. We got in to the park around 8:30. Once you get in to the park you need to immediately turn left. In between the M arcade and the town hall building is another line where you can buy the Premier Access Set. As of now, this is a MUST. It's not cheap, roughly $70-$88 each depending on whether it is a peak day or not. That is on top of the $75 each to get in to the park. I mean this is Disney after all so most people are probably intending on dropping some cash. They also have fast passes, but I am not exactly sure how they work and they seemed to be sold out at many of the rides. If you want to drop some serious cash, they are now offering a private guide service with which you cans skip all the lines, even at the entrance for roughly $2,700 for up to 6 people for 6 hours. The Premier Access Set gives you a set of 7 fast passes  - 1 for each of the following rides: Tron, Soaring, Winnie the Pooh, Peter Pan, Seven Dwarfs, Roaring Rapids, & Buzz Lightyear. After you purchase the set, they will take your picture with your cell phone and you will need to show it when you arrive at the rides.Unless you like waiting in long lines, you must get this. I did see ride wait times exceed 2 hours and it was 100 degree heat the day we were there. After we got the Premier Access Set we ran over to Pirates of the Caribbean and went in the single rider line which was about 20 min. After that we did all the rides in our set - Winnie the Pooh was closed, but we were able to do the other 6 which we felt satisfied with. They did open Winnie the Pooh again later in the day, but we had already left due to the heat. Unfortunately because of the extreme heat we were not able to enjoy the shows or shopping. We brought cooling towels to get us through, but if you can go at a cooler time of the year i would recommend it. Every ride we went on was truly spectacular !! They did not disappoint !!There has been a lot said about the pushing and shoving and the behavior of other guests. We did not see anyone defecating publicly, there was some line cutting and pushing with which we just pushed back. When in Rome .... You have to remember that China is the largest country in the world with a massive population. The Chinese are used to crowds and chaos. My experience with the Chinese people is that they are very sweet people and I truly don't think they mean harm. Now a few notes for the disney folks:The park opened at 8 am, yet none of the stands selling drinks or snacks and ice cream were open until 10 or 10:30. This makes no sense.The locker system at Tron is a mess. Not enough lockers, then we were asked to show our picture for the Premier Access Pass when our phone was already locked in the locker. Its a complete pain to have to go back - get the phone and lock it in the locker again. We tried to have lunch at Pinnochio's. There was a huge line for Pizza and they were coming out one at time. The employees seemed clueless how to handle the huge crowds and were completely disorganized. We ended up splitting 2 small pizzas among 5 of us, because we could wait any longer. I hope you will crack down on the scalpers. It seems very unfair for people spending their hard earned money to go to a special and trusted place like Disney, and be at risk of getting ripped off by scalpers. I have never seen or heard of this at any of the other Disney parks. Lastly, there has been a lot said about the lack of Disney ""Magic"". The park is very large which I think is one of the problems, and it definitely had a more amusement park feeling like a Six Flags than a warm magical place. That being said, every ride we went on the guests were all smiling and squealing with delight. Isn't that some ""Disney Magic"" as well ?"
846,4.0,Jul 2017,"Davis, CA ",Expect Huge Crowds,"We went there last year and came back this year. Expect huge crowds as always. A couple of things has changed since last year. Security lines open at 7 am and they start letting people into the park early. Rides don't start until 8 am. The security lines are a mess. Tons of scalpers will be calling out ""VIP pass/tickets etc"" The people who fall and buy into it, the scalpers will help push/cut them to the front of the security line. Lots more local Chinese this year seem to be willing to call them out. Once they get to the front, if you point them out, the security will hold them back and force them to the back. The scalpers turn and run, some will get physical. Once inside, lots of scalpers inside too who try to help you organize your day by grabbing fastpasses for you. Thus this has changed as well. In order to get fastpasses they require everyone in the party to be there. My husband was able to get a first set. For the second set, they wouldn't release it until I brought me and the kids along. I approve of this, but it is kind of a pain when you are trying to tag-team taking kids on rides and getting fastpasses. There is a major early morning rush to rides. We got in right at opening, walked straight to the snow white seven dwarfs ride and the wait was already 40 minutes. The app is pretty good about the times. The pirates of the carribean ride that is awesome and totally redone - was a huge wait this time compared to last year. By evening time, 7 pm and after, the lines slow down a lot. Chinese people tend to all eat right at dinner time and also a lot don't stay at the disneyland hotel so they start heading back to get on buses/ subway to head out. Remember to wear sneakers if you want to the the discovery trails rope course. Get fast passes for Tron - only place in the world with this ride. Remember it can rain on super hot summer days and when it rains it pours for 30mins to an hour. Seek shelter or bring umbrellas or raincoats. Lots of scalpers selling these too. Overall my kids had a lot of fun again. It helps it was our second time and we did not have major goals to hit."
847,5.0,Jul 2017,"Pomona, CA, ",One Amazing Disney Park,"The newest of the Disney Theme Parks, Shanghai Disneyland is fabulous.  Very large in geography.  Allow plenty of tine to walk between lands.  We were there during the hot part of the year, so half day visits were more than appropriate.  Two half days to walk around the park.  One evening to see the great Ignite the Night light and fireworks show.  Another day to get FastPasses to ride the attractions without waiting in line.  You can buy front of the line passes (Premier Access) but you have to get there early for any of these options.Pirates of the Caribbean is outstanding, Different than the other Pirates Attractions worldwide, but promises to entertain royally.  Tron Lightcycle is a one of kind thrill ride. If you don't ride at least watch it from different angles.Plenty of food and retail offerings.  The great attention to safety, courtesy, show and efficiency you have come to expect of Disney. "
848,4.0,Jul 2017,"Chandigarh, India ",A very Big Disney,"After seen the Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disney this Shanghai Disneyland appears much bigger. They have many new rides yet the old ones are also taking in a lot of crowd. i went on a thursday thinking it would be less crowded but the place was totally full. Each ride was taking atleast 1 hr of waiting, even more in some cases. The climate was very hot and they dont have many places to escape the heat. better check the weather before going."
849,4.0,Jul 2017,"Fort Worth, TX",There is a way to enjoy Shanghai Disneyland,"Most of the reviews for Disneyland Shanghai are unfair because they are complaining about the weather and the visitors. The actual park is very nice and has many fun and interesting attractions considering it opened only a year ago. If you go and want to have a good time here's what you need to do. 1. Take the first possible metro and get there early they start letting people in by 7:15 or so. 2. get into the park and go to the Avenue M arcade and buy the premier access pass!!!!!. you will need this pass during the summer if you don't want to wait over 2 hours for all the big rides. 3. go straight to pirates because that is the only big ride that is not on the premium access pass. 4. go to the crystal grotto ride because that is not on the pass either.  I got both of those rides done by 9 or so. 5. enjoy your day with lines that are almost always less than 20 minutes. I recommend riding tron and the jetpacks at night because they are cool with all the lights. -Tron is the best ride in my opinion, it is cooler than it looks. -If you want to go to the shows get there a half hour before they start. they tend to fill up quickly. -Mondays are not less crowded than Sundays during holiday break. -Download the Disney app it is very useful for finding everything in the park. It also has wait times. -If you are a star wars fan definitely watch the screening they have at the launch bay. It is a cool montage of the star wars saga.  -If you don't care about meeting characters the marvel universe is pretty lame.-The ignite you dreams show mostly relies on the projections on the castle so make sure you can see the whole  castle if you want to enjoy the show. -Don't carry around a lot of water bottles all day. The cold bottles at the park cost only 10 RMB. Yes there are also drinking fountains.  Overall, I can see why people have poor reviews. The park is not for the faint of heart. But if you follow the guidelines I set you should have a Magical day even on a holiday weekend, like I did. I think that the original Disneyland is much better than Shanghai. That being said, I still think the park was worth the visit."
850,2.0,Jun 2017,"Shanghai, China ",Shanghai disney not again,"My family is a big fan of disney, but not in shanghai, a chaos just to get the entry's ticket, the park is absolutely huge and it's beautiful but with rides you need to wait for an hour and half and it's ridiculous que, and so many locals all they have to do is squeeze and push you even there is some children they dont care..never again to come back"
851,3.0,Jun 2017,N/A,Disappointing ,So many people long lines and we went on a rainy day as we bought tickets in advance for this day as cheaper on Mondays.   Totally wasted our money as we did 2 rides only and some closed due to the rain could only imagine how much busier it would have been if we paid more to admit on a weekend. Look at daily rates as weekend is more expensive and good luck with ride lines have fast passes but had to even get in very early for these too
852,2.0,Jun 2017,"Boston, MA ",Didn't feel like Disney,"We are pretty big Disney fans - I've been to all of the other Disney parks around the world, we were married in Disney World, my family owns DVC, my father-in-law works for Disney, and we are WDW annual pass holders during some years... We're not so into the characters or movies, but more the service level, thoughtfulness, technology, and attention to detail we've come to expect from Disney. Visiting this park was not the purpose of our trip, but we ended up in Shanghai as part of three weeks in Asia, so we knew we had to stop in! Having said that, this was by far the worst Disney experience I've had. It didn't have the Disney feel at all. Wait times were minimum 200 minutes+ per ride when we arrived (this can happen at WDW too, but I've never seen it that bad for every single ride with the exception of Christmas week). We were planning to buy the Fastpass package anyway, but it was sold out. We visited on a Monday. I hate to say that we were appalled by the Chinese tourists, but it was terrible. We've all seen people get a bit edgy and selfish at any theme park, but this was crazy. The pushing and shoving, yelling, spitting, and smoking cigarettes in queues was baffling. There were also people - regular guests - walking up and down INSIDE the queues selling fake Disney merchandise (e.g. light-up toys, keychains, etc.). The first time it happened to us, I stared at the person in shock and she interpreted it as my interest to purchase something from her, then proceeded to continue harassing us. You're stuck in a queue, so it's not like you can get away from the person. This would never fly back home. There seemed to be no cast members around - the complete opposite of U.S. Disney parks where they are everywhere! The few cast members that we did encounter - like the ones checking our tickets at the entrance - were so rude. No smiles, no greeting, etc. I was worried that it was because we're American, but as I observed many others going through the turnstiles, realized it was just toward everyone. We did ride and love Tron - we waited about 2 hours to ride it, and there are lockers where you must put your belongings (can't bring any bags on the ride). There was a wait for the lockers! There weren't enough, so we had to keep running around trying different stations and get into the spirit of pushing and shoving to try to get a spot. In line for the ride, if you stand single file, people will push past you. My husband and I had to form a wall in order keep our place. When you turn a corner in a queue, there's extra space, and people will take advantage of that to move past. If I had read this without visiting, I would think this sounds crazy, but it really was exhausting to have to be on the defense for two hours. We were so excited that we did ride Tron, though, figuring that was the one big thing we could experience there and not here, and then came home to the news that it'll be coming to the Magic Kingdom :). Oh well. The food was mediocre, and honestly because the park was so big and spread out, a bit hard to find. You definitely had to go looking for it - not like at home where it seems to be everywhere. We were hoping to make a reservation for dinner before our trip, but were told they were only available for character meals, which we're not really into. The fireworks/laser show were also mediocre, and again - there's just not much respect for others when trying to watch any show there. We stopped in the World of Disney store on the way out, but couldn't find one item that said Shanghai Disney on it! We were hoping for a souvenir but couldn't come up with anything. I will say that the tickets were cheap by U.S. standards - we paid $54.34 per ticket for a one-day pass. They were easy to purchase on the app, and you can just go straight to the turnstiles with the phone ticket - no need to stop at a will-call booth. We took a taxi to and from our hotel in Downtown Shanghai, and that was easy too. I'm glad we checked this park off our list, but would not go back."

854,1.0,Jul 2017,"Mount Barney National Park, Australia ",Complete waste of time and money ,We had an absolutely horrible day at Disneyland today. We knew that it was going to be busy (being school holidays) and hot (being summer) but we didn't expect it to be so bad. The queues were ridiculous with Chinese people pushing and blatantly queue jumping. We waited in line for one ride- a carousel and were shocked by the number of older people who were pushing and shoving their way past young children who were lined up waiting for the ride. There was very little shade or escape from the heat and nowhere near enough seating around the place. The park itself was clean and definitely has the potential to be great- if only it was managed better. The number of people allowed into the park at once needs to be drastically reduced and staff need to enforce lining up and general manners of guests. We will never return! 
855,4.0,Jul 2017,"Brooklyn, NY ","Ok, so here's how to do this...","At the park right now.  Other reviews are correct.  The waits are ridiculous.  The heat is crazy (cooling towel and umbrella make it tolerable).  The park, however, is amazing, highlighted by the Pirates and Tron attractions!  The park is so large that it doesn't feel crowded when walking around or shopping and nighttime was MUCH quieter (walked on some rides after the fireworks) and stunningly beautiful. So, what you need to do is suck it up and pay the extra $80 US for the Premier Access pass which you can buy immediately on your left as you enter the park.  They started selling these to combat fastpass scalping. It's a lot of money, yes, but it gives you fastpasses for each FP attraction.  We had 10 minute waits for each.  Spending all the money to come here anyway?  It's a no brainer to add this.  We're having an amazing two day stay here and it was worth every penny. "
856,2.0,Jul 2017,"Utrecht, The Netherlands ",Enough of Disney for me,"Ok, admittedly, visiting Disneyland in mid-July with temperatures of up to 38 degrees C (approx. 100 degrees F) was perhaps not so smart. Anyhow, on an ordinary Wednesday, all major attractions (like the Tron rollercoaster) had >= 2 h waiting time between 10 (when we arrived) and 16:30 (when we left) - We checked regularly both through the app and when passing by. As waiting often has to be done at least to a large extent in the scorching sun, we were unable to do any of them - a major disappointment. For 220 Euros for three adults & two kids a major disappointment."
857,3.0,Jul 2017,"Palmview, Australia ",Disappointed,"This was our last Disney we needed to visit to do all Disneylands around the world.  Don't go in summer school holidays. The queues are long and slow and rides were 3+ hour wait times.  Not really a Disneyland park this is more like a theme park run by Disney.  Not a huge amount of shopping available and no Mickey ears to be seen anywhere.  The Disney attentive n to detail is just not there, rubbish everywhere, and not very clean at all.  We were seriously disappointed and have no intention to go back to this one. "
858,3.0,Jul 2017,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam ",Love/hate feeling,"Background: Shanghai Disneyland is the 3rd Disneyland after Hong Kong and Tokyo ones. Going with my children 8 and 9 on Monday and Tuesday.Good: Disneyland is always beautiful with the attention for the details for all the attractions. Toilets and everything are very clean with all the cleaners working all the time. All the attractions are very fun as usual, especially the Pirates of the Carribean. We almost finished all the attractions except Roaring Rapids, Soaring over the horizon and Tron. Since we bought the tickets online so the check-in is very easy and quick, we have no problem on this. We can get the Fastpass for the Buzz Lightyear at 11.30am, all other Fastpasses are distributed very fast, no more at 10am.Bad: as everyone's comments, it is too crowded and too hot. All the popular attractions are 150 mins wait time which we have to skip the main 3 ones. Everyone tried to push and cut into the lines every time they can, there are no private space, everyone is trying to stand under the other ppl's neck, which is very hot and sweating and annoying. Inside the attractions, since the wait time is too long, there are garbage everywhere and the cleaners only work outside the attractions. At around 3pm, there is the parade with all the dancers dancing enthusiastically and I am really feeling sorry for them since I am really sweating just by looking at them under the hot weather of 34 degree Celsius. Until now, I still dont understand why Disney has to build the entrance gate very far from the parking area, everyone has to walk very far to get into the entrance under the crazily hot weather without any roof. Not mention to a long line of ppl has to line under the sunshine without any covers except umbrellas or hats from their owns. It looks ruthless to me while the customers are treated like this.Tips:- go on the middle day of the weeks as Tue, Wed, Thurs, it will be less crowded, however all the popular attractions wait time is still 150 mins- dont go on summer, you cant live under this hot weather and will not enjoy anything. Trust me, I am from Vietnam which is tropical country (we have no winter and summer is very hot) but nothing can be compared with this. Except my kids are still very energetic, my husband and I almost faint on this heat.Overall, Shanghai Disneyland is still beautiful to me, however, to enjoy it fullest, we need to plan it strategically with the serious consideration of time and season to visit."
859,5.0,Jun 2017,"Toronto, Canada ",Wishing Star Park is one of the quietest and cleanest parks in Shanghai,"Our favourite part of Disneyland is Wishing Star Park, which is the free park located between the Disney hotel and the theme park. It's one of the least crowded and quietest parks we've visited in Shanghai, and one of the cleanest. Staff working there are obviously trained by Disney and are all happy, friendly, helpful, and polite. It's a great place to bring young children as there is a playground, wind chimes, funny mirrors, ducks and fish to feed, and clean bathrooms spaced out regularly.We go at least once a week, and staff often give little treats like stickers to the kiddos.If you just want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the large city, it's a quick and easy subway ride away to this oasis in the city."
860,4.0,Jul 2017,"Shanghai, China ",Already my third visit ,"All public places in China are crowded, so Disneyland. If you decide to visit Disneyland Shanghai you should consider some rules. 1. Never go on weekends. 2. Never go during public holidays or school vacation times. During this periods you'll face horrible waiting times at the main attractions. (150-200min for Trone or Roaring Rapids). Well, if you have to visit during this time then be well prepared. buy vip /fast passes in ahead. They are limited. Use the Park APP, you see live waiting times and you can easily decide where to go next. Be early! If you arrive the park after 9am you'll meet all the big groups at the entrance. (there is no separate group entrance). If you can, go on heavy rainy days in summer (Chinese avoid to go out in heavy rain / or also if it's too sunny) most attractions and waiting zones are under roof. Price for small bottle of water is 10rmb. Keep your bottle, there are drinking water stations everywhere and you can refill for free..... Have fun :) BTW... The treasure cove is my favorite... Awesome! "
861,3.0,Mar 2017,"Singapore, Singapore ",Family Bonding Trip for 3 Generations.,"Overall Visit should have been good. But your day spend there is not value for money as the Queuing Time is not worth the Long Wait even though we went on a Weekday (Thursday). The Popular gaming entrance waiting time is on an average of 2 hours plus minus ON A WEEKDAY. On Weekends and Public Holidays the Waiting Time at each game is even Longer, 3 to 5 hours Waiting!!! If you go there Late say 11 a.m. You will at very most gain Entry to No more Than 4 games and that's being generous to Disneyland Shanghai!!!!!!!!!This is likened to Daylight Robbery because you spend all your time WAITING  and QUEUING after you had already Paid for your Tickets. When you join the Queues, you will end up regretting having paid in advance for a family of 8 persons comprising 3 Seniors, 2 mid age adults, 1 teenager and 2 under 10 years children. It was fun being together BUT IT WAS NO JOKE AND NO FUN WAITING AND QUEUING LIKE FOOLS & SUCKERS OF THIS ABSURDLY CROWDED THEME PARK!!!"
862,2.0,Jul 2017,N/A,"Too hot, too crowded and too expensive in July ","Yes, this is the newest disney park (opened June 2016). It has many new (and very exciting rides ), but to wait 159 minutes (sometimes more than what is posted) in the sun (95+ degrees with 80% humidity) is not reasonable or fun - all this for a 90 seconds to 3 minute ride.Disney consideres july as high season, so tickets are more expensive  (499 RMB=$85).If you can, delay your visit to low season.  Costs less and the lines are more manageable.Do not forget that everything else (food, drinks, snacks  and gifts) are disney pricing all year long.We have been standing in line for over 120 minutes in the heat to try one of their new rides (tron). Everyone said it is GREAT - NOT SURE ANY RIDE IS WORTH 160 MONUTE WAIT.bring water bottles, you can inter the park with water bitgkes and fill tgem up (for free) at conveieant fountains."
863,1.0,Jul 2017,"Brisbane, Australia ",Worst Disney ever,This has got to be the worst Disney park in the world. I took 2 hours to get through security and the entrance gates. They have no idea how to queue. Everyone just pushes to the front and the park staff do nothing to stop it. There is trash everywhere. There are people trying to sell knockoff Disney merch in the parks which again the staff do nothing to stop. I'm glad I've been to other Disney parks because this would have been an awful first impression. Would never return to this place again. 
864,4.0,Feb 2017,"Singapore, Singapore ",Better than expected,"I thought it would be worse, but overall it was acceptable. Not as impressive as Tokyo Disney Sea. The one in Tokyo is more delicately-crafted, this one is more of an outdoor in the open theme park. There are some great attractions like Pirates of the Caribbean and Tron, there's also a boring one like rowing an Indian boat in the lake. The best part would be the fireworks before the park closes, great performances, very impressed. Might visit again <3 TIPS: Download the park's official application to see how many minutes you have to wait for each attraction to help you plan how you will spend your day here. Arrive early, like before the park opens at least half an hour."
865,1.0,Jul 2017,"Shanghai, China ","Not just the worst Disney, the worst theme park ever","If that headline doesn't tell you enough, here's more. Disney Shanghai sucks, then it comes around and blows, and then it comes back and sucks again.The reason is simple - utterly amateurish crowd management. Starting from a cumbersome security check and park entry that took us AN HOUR (at 845 a.m) to all key attractions having 150 - 180 minute waits and even minor attractions having 30 min or more waits... all within an hour of opening. We had to line up for 20 minutes to get fastpasses, and we could only get them for 2 rides before they ran out. Even with fastpasses it took 20 minutes to get to the ride... need I go on?And unfortunately, even for someone like me who lives in China and loves the people, the crowds and queues brought out their worst behavior. Queue jumping, people fighting with staff, all sorts of meltdowns that completely destroyed the Disney experience.I've never spent so many hours in a theme park and done so little. It didnt help that many of the theatres and shows which could have helped provide some sense of being entertained were closed (temporarily!) there were no street parades, hardly anything outside of the rides and attractions themselves to absorb peoples attention while waiting around.So do yourself a favor, skip this one. I have not one good thing to say about it, apart from the fact that if you actually get to them, the rides are pretty dope. Good luck with that.."

867,2.0,Jun 2017,"Huntersville, NC ","Sadly, the Worst Disney Park in the World","Having now been to every Disney park around the globe, I can say pretty easily that Shanghai Disney was my least favorite.  It's big and has some really great rides (Tron is one of my faves worldwide) but the place is very poorly run.  You've already heard about the line cutting, trash, and kids peeing outside (all true, but all overblown and not that big a deal in my opinion) but the true travesty with this park is the lack of Disney charm and, more importantly, management oversight.  I can't believe Disney is allowing things to be run as poorly as they are here.  The lines just to get in the park are insane -  the security line and the entry queues are epic.  But they don't need to be.  We were in Tokyo before Shanghai and those parks are pretty crowded but their security lines are virtually nonexistent and the tickets scan fast so people can flood into the park.  It took us a long time to get into the Shanghai park both days we went, probably about 90 minutes, and mostly due to slow security checks and a clunky ticket reading system. We were there right at opening time the first day (a Thursday) and an hour early the next day. We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel (which was very nice but offered zero perks).Once inside the park, things don't get better.  A third-party security company makes up about half of the staff rather than normal Disney cast members, and the security people are not friendly.  But they also don't do their jobs very well, as guys are selling fast passes and cutting lines right in front of them and they don't react.  We bought the full slate of fast passes both days we were there and frankly if we hadn't we would have a had a truly rotten time  Wait times were hours long, and the queues for fast passes were no picnic either.  You buy the passes (which consist of a stack of 7 individual ride passes in a little plastic sleeve) just as you enter the park, immediately on the left side of Mickey Avenue.  It takes awhile to buy the passes since you have to deal with several stages of cast members, including one who takes your picture with your phone so you can show the photo of you buying the passes to the cast members and security guards manning the fast pass lines.  We had to show the photo every time we used the passes and sometimes more than once.  The first time we rode Tron I put my phone in the locker as directed and then was asked for the photo once we got in the fast pass line.  So I had to go back to get my phone out of the locker, which is not an easy thing to do.  When we used regular fast passes, we had to show our park tickets too, again sometimes more than once.  We only managed to get three or four regular fast passes over two days.  Sometimes they let me get passes for the whole group by myself and a couple times they told me I could only get one fast pass.  So the gist of it is that they are making it really hard to get and use fast passes but aren't doing anything about the touts selling the fast passes right out in the open.  Weird.  By the way, three fast pass sets cost $213 (US). Ouch, but totally worth it.There are some redeeming features at Shanghai Disney.  Tron is awesome, especially if you sit in the very front.  Pirates is cool but I didn't think it was as great as advertised- too much reliance on screens rather than actual sets and effects.  Buzz is awesome - you can actually see where you're shooting!  Seven Dwarves, Soaring, and Roaring Rapids were all fun.  The ropes course was good fun too.  We really enjoyed the caramel popcorn and got a cool Mickey popcorn holder that would have been at home in Tokyo.  Otherwise though the food wasn't very good.  The castle is pretty impressive.  The fireworks shows were cancelled both nights we were there.But really overall we didn't have a great time at Shanghai Disney.  We seriously considered not going the second day, but we did go and probably had a better time the second day since our expectations were tempered.  But we won't be back.  We're already considering a return to Tokyo and Hong Kong, but we're likely done with Shanghai, at least until a major shakeup happens."

869,5.0,Jun 2017,"Kaatsheuvel, The Netherlands ",Great Disney park but plan accordingly!!!,"We are big Disney fans so visiting Shanghai was on our list of places to visit this year. Let me say that the park is great. It has some very unique rides and the attention to detail is what you would expect from Disney. But....plan wisely....we visited the park on 2 days and the crowds were insane. I have never seen this many people in a themepark in my whole life, and we have seen a lot over the years. We were lucky enough to be visting when schools were out of session, believe me you do not want that. We left the hotel at 7 am to be one of the first people at the gate, we had no chance because the entrance area was already swarming with people. Wait times for the big rides were 3 to 4 hours. But when you go in the evening during the fireworks and close to closing time you can do a lot of rides with minimal waits!!! We will go again but never again when children are out of school or on Chinese holidays. The park really is worth a visit."
870,4.0,Jul 2017,"Santa Clara, CA ",Shanghai Disney on July 4th,"We visited Shanghai Disney on July 4, 2017 as a group of 7 (4 adults, 3 children). First off, drop off for people arriving in private vehicles is about 1 km away from the main ticket gates. It was hard to find and a long walk across a bridge over the divided highway. We arrived at about 6:30 am and were in the line for security screening by 7am. Following the security screening, we got in line to get tickets and get into the park. We had purchased tickets online and had to show passport to get the tickets. Once we got the tickets, we searched for the premier pass line, which is sold on main street very close to guest services. The premier pass allows you to ride all the fast pass rides in the park a single time (tron, winnie the pooh, soaring over the horizon, peter pan, roaring rapids, seven dwarves mine train, buzz lightyear). Cost is $600 RMB per person for the set. It is worth it on very crowded days. Anytime you go to Disney in the Summer is a crowded day because the kids are out of school. We made it to Tron by 8am and rode in standby with a 15 minute wait. After we got out, the line was 1 hour long. We walked clockwise around the park hitting all the fast pass rides and jumping into shows and exhibits (star wars, marvel super heroes, pirates show) opportunistically. The pirates of the caribbean ride was a 60 minute wait and we did this one in the heat of the day....very draining. There is no fastpass for this ride. It is an amazing upgrade from the old pirates of the caribbean ride. We made it all the way around and went back to Tron with fastpass in hand. Ate dinner at 7pm in Disneytown. Walked back to the pick up area and were out of there around 8:30pm. We were exhausted from the heat and the walking. If you are willing to shell out for premier pass, you can have a good time. If not, you will wait in very long lines and you will not be able to ride very many rides unless you come very early or leave at closing. I think the golden hour is at 8am-9am and 9pm to 10pm. Best advice is to go when school is in session during a weekday in the winter. If you can't go then, then I would suggest a premier pass. There are people trying to sell fast passess all over the place, but I would not trust them. Compared to other Disney parks, Shanghai disney has an outstanding roller coaster in Tron. They have an upgraded Pirates ride that is really amazing. The park is huge and the crowds are huge as well. People do get close to you in line and some will try to get in front of you so you have to be on the ball and continually close gaps. This is part of Chinese culture so I'm used to it as I have lived in China for a while now. I hope that Disney continues to expand the number of rides in Shanghai Disney because there seems to be fewer rides in this park relative to others. I would go again and ride Tron as many times as I could."
871,4.0,Jun 2017,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ",Disney-style entertainment with a Chinese flavour,"This was my third Disneyland experience after Paris and Hong Kong.I was there on the park's first anniversary. I reached the park's entrance with my pre-purchased ticket from its website at around 10:30 am. I went to the park by taking the metro from Nanjing East Road Station, which cost me RMB 5/way. The security check was quick and had to queue approximately another 20 minutes at the turnstile to collect my ticket. I was asked to show my passport to authenticate my identity before my ticket being issued.      I find that the park is very spacious and thus I did not feel crowded walking in the park. As with all the reviews about the park on TripAdvisor and elsewhere, the queues for rides were indeed long (moreover that I visited on the park's first anniversary). The long queues did limit the amount of rides I could manage to enjoy. In terms of the attractions, I find them to be of high quality and technological advanced. The Disney way of story telling never failed to wow and excite me. As mentioned in the title that this park has Chinese flavour, the live shows in this park embraced that flavour. For example, the Tarzan live show included acrobatic elements as part of the story telling.While there were news circulated during the park's opening months that the crowd were very uncivilised, for example, sleeping, urinating, stepping everywhere. I would like to say that such uncivilised behaviours were no longer seen in the park. I actually find that the crowd were behaving well with a very small percentage that actually did intentionally try to cut the queue.I personally find that this is a two-day park as I did not manage to cover most of the attractions in one day.Would recommend a visit if you like the Disney-style of story telling."
872,1.0,Jul 2017,"San Francisco, CA ",The most miserable park on Earth,"Zero stars if I could. Our experience:1) We arrived at opening time (8am) with pre-bought tickets and were greeted with a tsunami of people all pushing their way towards the gate. Some of them smoking, umbrellas hitting your face, people shoving their way through the crowd forcefully making weak excuses why they had to get to the front. Some guys were selling this line cutting as a service (you pay them and they'd push through the line with you and a dozen others snaking behind them in a conga-line pretending to all be family). The tsunami moved slowly and took an entire hour. We should've taken the hint right then and tried to get a refund. This felt more like a prison than a theme park. The TSA is a spa treatment compared to getting into Disneyland Shanghai. Even my Dad, who is patient to a fault, is getting frustrated with the chaotic and unpredictable situation.Finally, we're through! Hurray. But wait! There's more! Once you do that, you get to do it ALL OVER AGAIN so they can scan your ticket!!! We arrived at 8am and got into the park at 10am, completely exposed the entire time in sweltering Shanghai summer. My wife wanted to go home before we even got in the park. Security was useless, they just watched the non-stop bad behavior with a sense of resignation on their sad faces. 2) We get in the park. I go to the first restroom. Puddles of pee all over the floor. I'm wearing flip flops and get some on the back of my leg. But, like a prisoner who just got freedom, I wasn't about to let something like excrement on my leg get in the way of enjoying myself.3) We head to the nearest cafe on the map to find respite from the heat and rest our tired legs after the two hour mosh pit. It doesn't open until 10:30? So we end up going to a coffee shop instead. We got to the counter to order but people kept going around us and aggressively demanding to be served. The cast members serve them instead of my wife and I. It feels like they've given up trying to ""civilize"" the visitors to this madhouse of a park. Finally I get a mocha and a red bean pastry. I sip on my mocha. This is the highlight of time at Disneyland Shanghai.4) We head to Tomorrowland. No shade, nowhere to sit, sweltering heat and the sun reflecting off the white tile. We take a look at the Fastpass line. It's just a huge crowd of people, barely moving. Nevermind. The shortest queue in tomorrowland is ""Buzz Lightyear"" at ""only"" 50 minutes long. The ride itself is a mere shadow of the one at California Adventure. It breaks down once while we're on it. But my wife and I were relieved, because at least in the broken down ride, we had air conditioning and nobody was pushing us or coughing on us. I was a bit disappointed when it started up again.5) Tron queue is 3 hours long and at least an hour of that is outside. So we decide to get lunch at the Star-something Grill. McDonald's could teach them something about making a decent burger. It had no sauce at all. My wife's korean pork sandwich was better tasting so I'd recommend that. 6) Nothing else to do here so we leave Tomorrowland and head to the vaunted ""Pirates"" ride which boasts a mere 70 minute queue on the app. On the way we stop to get water because because we've seen relatively few booths selling cold water. 15 minute queue for the water with people constantly jumping the queue and cast members turning a blind eye. 6) We arrive at the vaunted Pirates ride. The queue closes as soon as we arrive. The cast members offer no explanation and shoo us away. We head to the nearby Pirates gift shop for some respite from the heat. Many others in the park have done the same and the gift shop is jam packed with people shoulder to shoulder. My wife has had enough. We leave the park posthaste. Our favorite part of going to Disneyland Shanghai was getting the hell out."

I visited the Shanghai park on its one year anniversary, we reached the park just before it opened and it took us one hr just to get in. Went immediately to get paid fast pass and guess what 4 out of the 7 rides were already sold out. Well at the end i did manage to cover all the main/adult rides in park besides the Roaring Rapids & Soaring over the Horizon( they had wait times from 2 1/2 hrs to 3 hrs !!!). The only two rides which stood out for me and i did twice were Tron Lightcycle Power Run for the thrills and Pirates of Caribbean Battle for Shrunken Treasure for its visuals. If you ask me the visit to park is worth it just for these two rides. Saw two shows, Frozen and Jack Sparrow one, both were in Chinese, Frozen was waste of time as the songs were all in mandarin whereas the action spectacular of Jack Sparrow was fun, specially the ending.  Food is a problem for vegetarians with little option, there is a Veg Burger available at Stargazer Grill at Tomorrowland,  the size is huge but its got a smell of fish oil."

The rides was so much fun, all with the latest technology ( most of them are all in 4D )but will not come back for another 3-5 years. Can't stand of the people and their behaviors.So sick of china mainland people really don't have manners. The line was crazy. People who stood on the line was even crazier. People pushes even when in the line. A lot of people selling fake disney items, raincoat and even cigarettes.The crew member try their best clean up the mess they made, but still for these huge amount of no manner people, the crew is overworked. I found they even peed on the pedestrian. Because they can't find toilet.😓😓😓😓😡😡😡😡The line just to get into the park took 2-3 hours even with a ticket on your hand. The rides queue was extremely long. Min 60min each rides, up to 265 min for most wanted rides. My tips if you want to survive shanghai disneyland :1. Don't go during china holiday2. If you can't find other time to go,Then do the following in no.33. DON'T TRY TO ARRIVE EARLY.The chinese come to queue up from 5.30 (We can't compete with that)4. ARRIVE after 11 am, so the crowd already got into the park. So you don't have to queue.5. After you got in, don't try to have a fast pass. To get a fast pass you also need to queue very long line. Forget about it.6. Do the less popular rides first which queue line is shorter. ( see the waiting time from the apps of shanghai disneyland)7. When queuing put your hands cross from one bar to another. So people can't go through you. As people will try to skip and pushes  you in the line.7. Watch shows like frozen, tarzan, baymax.Even the line is long, they have shows evey 20-30 min. So the crowd goes inside a lot in the same time. 8. When it's afternoon around 5-7 pm you can try to queue up for more popular rides like buzz, peter pan's flight, tron,  pirates of carribean etc (but not soaring to horizon, and roaring rapids, the queue will still be 180 min).9. After 8 pm, don't queue up for soaring to horizon, and roaring rapids yet, but stand in front of the rides. See the crowd getting less as they will be merging to watch the fireworks .10. After the crowd already merge for fireworks, you can do the soaring to horizon, and roaring rapids. (I've done mine, i entered roaring rapids at 8.15, finished at 8.40, went directly to soaring of the horizon and finished it when the park is closed)11. When the park closed, the stores in front still open for about an hour. So you can shop freely on the way back to the hotel, with less crowd."

884,1.0,Jun 2017,zhiejiang ,Shanghai Disneyland....the most unhappy place on earth...stay away...,"I find it difficult having being to other Disneyland’s around the world how anyone can possibly rate this 5 stars or say its better than others, you cannot be serious! Give Shanghai Disneyland a big miss and go to one of their other parks if so inclined, more accessible rides and far more enjoyable. As a former china expat and now holidaying foreigner to China, this is not a place you want to take your children, not at all. We spent nearly 5 HOURS today, yes, 5 HOURS just to get into the park today with pre-paid tickets after arriving 45 minutes before the gates were even open at 8am, ie. 7:15am. In sweltering heat and after assisting several local children and basically reduced to screaming at the few staff present to help assist other fainting children in the cues I was absolutely mortified. I found this a very dangerous situation no Disney staff seemed to care about. Tried to keep my cool for the sake of my young son on his birthday who we had planned this trip for and flown from overseas to take him to, has welts on his arm from the pushing and prodding in the sustained stampede like rush to get into the park. Could not get on a single ride and to be honest didn’t even bother trying once we entered the park by around 12 pm to find the few worth going on were either broken down or 4 hour + wait times anyway - fast passes non existent, forget the app times or at least double them we found. Could hardly move around the place, was hard to even breathe at times, forget trying to find place to eat or sit, people lying on the ground everywhere, spent 20 minutes at one stage in a cue just to buy bottle of water. Park sold out  and no tickets available for sale at gate via website notification night before we went for sake of 'protecting park experience' they said; ‘absolute rubbish’, precariously overcrowded to the point of being practically dangerous and as a safety expert I know and it should be addressed. Food incredibly expensive and poor and fake touts who we saw waltz through security wheeling suitcases un-abated through security check-in ahead of us and then selling mickey ears cheap in the smoking areas was just comical and made mockery of the hours spent waiting on entry security measures. Only saving grace was the star wars exhibit for our son, to be honest only went there like many others to get into air conditioning.Trying so hard to say something positive, yes, lots of money spent by Disney, yes, massive profits being made no doubt, wish i was a stockholder, but as a customer and a customer experience, whilst I doubt my review would bother the Disney executives or their bottom line, all my 11 year old son will be doing is going home and telling everyone not to ever go to a Disneyland, especially Shanghai Disneyland. As for me, leaving early with a heart broken child like so many others (some even leaving from the cues to get in) and such great experiences at other Disneyland's before son was born, would like to know who to talk to about getting my money back as feel nothing but absolutely ripped off……….. Enjoy Shanghai, but stay away from Shanghai Disneyland, you will be .disappointed."

886,4.0,Jun 2017,"Cooktown, Australia ",Disney experience with queues,"Ok where to begin about Shanghai Disneyland. First is yes you will see some cultural shocks when you visit the park. I did see a few little kids per in the line but honestly if line wait of 1-3hrs is the norm little kids will end up having to go. The other thing I have to comment on is the way most park visitors queue. Park entrance,  1.5hr wait to just get in, every children's  ride at 1hr wait,  exciting rides 2-3hr waits leaves a seasoned theme park visitor like me having to make decisions I usually would not do when visiting a park. I did more eating and shopping. Just as a fyi it was school holidays in Shanghai and each day was a sell out. The rides and shows are worth normal theme park wait times but I regularly saw the park app saying 210 minutes. This makes the ride a deminishing return as you truly loose a lot of your park day in lines. This negative experience is magnified by the desperation of the people in a queue. If there is any space in the line there will be a local filling it. So lines that normally would have up to 2 people taking up room from chain to chain you would regularly have 4-6 people crammed there. It made just getting into the park a real chore. Did I have fun though? Yes but not in the usual way I would visit a theme park as I am a thrill ride junkie. I got to take in shows, shopping and the dinseytown experience. Still it is 1 yr old and I still feel the park is just attracting many first time visitors and families. The park has plenty to offer just beware what time of year you visit. Also being summer it is storm season so beware the heavy rains in the afternoon. My 3yr old loved it but the size of the park did stress him and he was very cranky when it was supposed to be in nap time. He talks about his visit with excitement so I guess he doesn't remember the negatives. "
887,1.0,Jun 2017,"Richwood, KY ",Shanghai Disney - Crowds and Counterfeit Merchandise,"My family just spent 2 days at Shanghai Disney on June 21 & 22. Here is my experience:Good: The Tron ride and Pirates of the Caribbean are outstanding. The Pirates ride is based on the last 2 movies and the effects and visuals are top notch. The Tron coaster is a dark room ride based on the Tron sequel. You will need to get a free locker before the Tron ride for any back packs, purses, etc. The night show with lights, fire, and images on the castle is excellent and should not be missed. The best way to watch is to go to Downtown Disney, get a table on the upper terrace at Wolfgang Puck’s restaurant, and watch the show while you eat dinner away from the crowds. Downtown Disney is outside the park, so you can go to Puck’s for dinner and watch the show without entering the park.Bad: There is a lot of bad to this park. Crossing the bridge from the parking lot to the security gates, there are people selling counterfeit tickets, fast Pass, ears, toys, etc. The security check takes 45 minutes, and then you have to wait another 40-45 minutes to get your ticket and enter the park. There are security guards all over the park and they do nothing. The Chinese have elevated pushing, shoving, and cutting in line to an art form. You have to push and shove to get along. People are selling counterfeit merchandise from back packs all over the park. Children will go the bathroom anywhere in the park. I saw two kids urinating in the plants next to a restaurant. There is garbage though out the park, ponds, and in the lines. People just throw their trash on the ground and it is not cleaned up until the park closes.The wait for rides is generally less than 45 minutes in the early morning. By 10:30am it is 3 hours for Tron, River Rapids, and Soaring. By noon, the wait is 4 hours! I have been to all of the Disney Parks worldwide. The least amount of crowds is in Hong Kong, Florida is the gold standard, Paris is great in the fall, and Tokyo has the most polite people on the planet. Shanghai Disney is a crowded, dirty mess with counterfeit merchandise. I would not recommend going. I am a big fan of Disney, however, I am so disappointed that they did not maintain their usual high standards of customer service and safety at Shanghai.DO NOT waste your money or time on this park. If you choose to go, buy your tickets far in advance and bring cash. American Express is not accepted, Visa and Master Card sometime, there is no logic to the days when it is accepted. Bring your passport: US citizens cannot by a ticket without your passport."
888,2.0,Jun 2017,N/A,"Crowded, lacking the Disney magic","Lines, lines and more lines!!! Be prepared to wait hours. It took 3.5hrs to get onto the Tron ride last week. After 2.5hrs just to get through the front gates!! I feel this could have been halved if the lines were more organised and the locker situation was sorted! To just get through to the initial locker section of the Tron ride is a nightmare. You have to wait for someone to return with a key after they've been on the ride. There are about 50 lockers and what felt like 3000 people in line. A joke! Then when finally in a line for the actual ride outside, there is a line inside that you go through too where we saw the actual ride and that seats were not being filled up! Infuriating to say the least. The park as a whole was missing that Disney magic and the excitment thats in the air at other parks I've been too. I saw one character out and about, but most likely because there was always a sea of people everywhere. I was really disappointed with this place. Crowd control and limited daily entry numbers is required for a better experience. Sad to say this about a Disney park but I felt a day of precious holiday time was wasted here. "
889,1.0,Jun 2017,"Edmonton, Canada ",the most miserable place on earth ,my husband and I only lasted 3 hours in this park. The lines were outrageous - 3 hours at least to wait for any of the good rides. We waited 40 minutes in line for a fast pass only to find out the fast pass for the roller coaster was sold out by the time we got to the front (about noon) and so we had to get it for the buzz light year ride. When we went on that ride it broke down 4 times while we were on it. We went for lunch and couldn't find a spot to sit. All the fast passes were sold out by 1 for every single ride. The wait time for secondary rides (ie the dumb ride for example) was 110 minutes. And the queue lines are just people pushing and shoving each other - they have security guards monitoring everything.  Two guys got in a fist fight in the past pass line. It is the most crowded park we have ever been to. We were kind of disappointed that Disney wouldn't limit the amount of tickets sold. It was so terrible. If you like Disney do not go to this park. 
890,2.0,Feb 2017,"Miami, FL ",Even not crowded you will not find...,"You will not find fast pass tickets to any attraction and people will leave anything else for the main attractions of the park meaning that if there is 1000 people visiting 997 of them will be making a 3 4 hours line on the main attraction and then going ot packed the next one... Even when is not crowded and you get there as soon as they open you will not be able to rent and stroller on the customer services office, but as soon as you walk 50m from the entrance you will be approached by an ordinary lady to offer you any of the 25 strollers she got parked 10 meters away... of course for the double or triple of the official fee... and no one notices it... I mean no staff even realizes... conveniently. Even when is not crowded will be impossible to get a balloon for your kids from the Disney employee because of the crowd fighting to take them by force or intimidation... but 20 minutes later those threatening guys will approach you smiling to offer you as many balloons as you want for the triple of the quadruple of the original price…Even when is not crowded there will be someone trying to cut the line in front of you with all naturality.Even when is not crowded and you run to get a fast pass immediately, fast passes will be sold out to who knows who because there is not even a line in the office (the only place without lines in the park… They should implement same efficiency everywhere) … but as soon as you get to the fast pass attraction someone will approach you to offer as many fast passes as you would need for almost the same price of the park ticket… And so on… The only awesome thing was the Cheesecake Factory… by the way if you plan to stay on the hotel resorts don’t go for the toy story one… is like the guard’s hut in the park…. You’ll be much better elsewhere… or go for the main hotel… From all my Disney’s this was by far the less magical… not even the Tron ride can compensate all the flaws…And the Lion King theater balcony seats on the first row… not worth! And you must beg for some sort of additional stool or something for your shorties… because anything you need they will get it after the show starts… meaning no first 15 minutes of the play for you…And I was so happy to have a closer Disney… won’t be back in years…"
891,4.0,Jun 2017,"Nottingham, UK ",Interesting,The rides and castle are amazing and clean. The only thing that annoyed us was the people selling fake Disney items in the queues for rides pushing past you constantly. Also not being able to get a fast pass as people go in early get them and start selling them for a lot of money in the afternoon.
892,2.0,Jun 2017,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK ",3 hour queues for rides and they aren't filling the seats up! Utter joke!! ,"We visited on a Wednesday and booked our tickets online. Arrived at the park at 9am to queue for over an hour just to get through security. We then queued for nearly 2 hours to get through the ticket stand - this is with pre-booked tickets. The queues are not an orderly fashion and just a big space with everyone pushing to get to the front, and are actually quite dangerous, a fight broke out in the line between a few women. The security were also horrible and shouting at customers for no apparent reason.We got in the park just after 12pm and didn't leave until 9.30pm and managed to get on 3 rides!! I fully expect to queue for at least an hour for rides but 3 hours is ridiculous. THEN when we reached the front we noticed they weren't filling the rides full, there were 8 empty seats on our ride alone!! Joke! We did not even get to see 2 sections of the park, or visit the souvenir shops, with just a 5 minute stop to eat a hotdog we were constantly on the move and didn't cover a lot of the park. We tried to visit some shops and get one more ride in towards the end of the night when queues were down to 30 minute wait, but you literally can not move as everyone gathers round the castle for the fireworks at 8.30 and they leave no pathway, we had to push and struggle our way through!! The show on the castle is great, probably the best bit, fireworks are pitiful but you don't need them when you have the animation going on. The toilets were a mess, there is no bin provided so everyone has piled their toilet roll on the floor by the loo - disgusting!! Make sure you buy your return metro ticket in advance as more queues for these, and be prepared to battle on the metro as well. The Chinese don't realise everyone will get on you just have to be patient, the pushing and shoving with kids as well, is unreal and another fight broke out on the metro! Overall if they are going to have such a huge attraction they need to be able to cope with the demand for it. Stop being so greedy and limit the amount of people permitted in to the park so they can enjoy all it has to offer. Personally I would not return or recommend and it does not come close to Disneyland Paris. "
893,3.0,Jun 2017,"Dallas, TX ",Great Park But Too Crowded!,"The park is so detailed, beautiful and clean but that is overshadowed by the immense crowds that swarmed us. We went on a random weekday (and bought tickets online) and it still took us 2.5 hours to finally get in the park once we arrived. The lines were outrageous inside the park as well and we were only able to ride 1 ride. Disappointing day. "
894,1.0,Jun 2017,Indonesia ,Very bad experience ,"I visit shanghai disneyland 28th june 2017 and I had a very bad experience. Most local people didnt want to queue, they open the fence from the garden when in peter pan flight area. No officer was there. About 20people passed it. Many rubbishes all over the park, it's dirtiest disneyland compare with the one in japan and hongkong. Most local people very rude"
895,4.0,Jun 2017,"Bengaluru, India ",Magical & beautiful but you need to plan to have a great time,"OK so this a beautiful park with great attention to detail but it is not for the lazy or even people who want to enjoy it leisurely in their own sweet time. This is true at least for this month - June when kids here in China have their summer holidays going on. We earlier planned on visiting the park on weekdays.. But as we closely started monitoring wait times from first week of June, we realised that the wait times around this month was higher on weekdays than on weekends.. Only to find out later that kids here have summer holidays going on. So we took a chance and went on a Sunday June 25th (my birthday yay) and we were right.. The wait times were considerably less. My  husband rode Tron 3 times and we covered almost all rides in just one day. Tips :1. This decides how your day basically goes. Get there by 7. This is the biggest win for you if you are there by 7 AM in the morning. The queue for fastpass starts as early as 8 AM in the morning. And you will need at least an hour to enter the park. So 7 is your magic number. We were staying near pusan which is just four metro stops away from Disneyland.2. Just run and get your first fastpass for Roaring rapids or Soaring over the horizon. 3. Wait in line for either seven dwarf or Pirates as early as 8:30 AM in the morning when the wait time is just about 15-20 mins around that time. 4. If there is a single rider option please use it... For every ride that has single rider just GO. 5. Also from the past week I think the rides are operating till 10PM in the night. So make use of it. Me and my husband were there from 7 AM till 10PM in the night along with our 2 year old who loved every single ride BTW :) 6. My last ride of the day was seven dwarfs at around 9:20 PM when the wait time was just 10-15 mins and my husband rode Tron 2 times at the end of the night at around 9:50PM ..there were just two others with him in the entire Ride which he says was the best Part. I see a lot of bad reviews here and I know why.. If a person has to wait in line for 250 mins to get on a 2 mins ride it's only sane to rate it as poor or terrible. But quite frankly my family thoroughly enjoyed this park because we are the kind of people who love to plan and strategies stuff and we love a lot of running around/physical exhaustion & shanghai disneyland gave us just that(Park is hugeeee).. It kept us engaged, made us think of  strategies to skip queues and it all worked out well for us. I am snatching a star away because a guy cut the line and I told him it's not okay to which he let me get ahead of him but still nobody said a word not even the cast member right in front of us. But then again this is understandable since I too come from a country with a population of 1.3 billion people.. When population is that high even if 1% of people misbehave it still accounts to 10 million people being rude or unruly. All part and parcel of densely populated countries. We had a great time here and highly recommend only if you can get there early. And please do plan ahead.  I would like to thank all the reviews here on TripAdvisor. Helped us a lot. Thanks :)"
896,4.0,Aug 2016,"Jakarta, Indonesia ",It Is Big!,"No kidding, it is the biggest Disneyland/Magic Kingdom!But it will take some time before we can call it the best. While some attractions worth the buzz like Tron Lightcycle and the best Pirates of the Carribean ride in the world, most attraction are copies of other Disney rides around the world.Let's see for another 5 to 10 years if most empty lots will already be filled with more attractions and if the visitors' habits will be more orderly mannered. Let's see if there will be another Disney theme park next to the ""Land"", 2 lands is always better than 1. Notes: Non-Chinese speaking visitors may find it hard to experience optimal fun since some supposedly very fun shows are presented in Chinese only."
897,2.0,Jun 2017,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates ",Waste of time and money. Just dont!!,"Been to a few around the world and this is by far the worst. We arrived early, 7.30am, before the gates had opened. Even though the ques were long we got in reasonably quickly, maybe 25 minutes. The single biggest issue is the waiting time for the rides. Up to 4 (yes FOUR) hour for the good rides after maybe 10am, One of our kids went on a good one as soon as we arrived and waited maybe 30 minutes. This quickly blew out to 2 hours.  Assuming profitability they need to invest in more rides or restrict the amount of people they let in. For example, there is a canoe paddle ""ride"" which was only a 90 minute wait. The reason it takes so long is there are only 3 canoes where I reckon they could easily accommodate 6. Such a shame as the park is new, clean and reasonably well organised.  You need to explain to your kids that if you go you will wait in ques for hours.  Personally I would give it a miss and find something else to spend the time and money on."
898,3.0,Jun 2017,"Cambridge, UK ","Magical setting, haunting crowds ","As far as Disney parks go, this is up there with the best! It's very clean, filled with colour and brings out your inner child and fond memories of Disney! As a new park, it's understandably still getting things right! We went on a weekday, thinking it may be a tad quieter. Boy we're we wrong! We queued for over an hour just to get a ticket from the box office (although this is available online too), and then queued a further 45 minutes to get into the park through security. Once inside, the shortest queue was around an hour, and the bigger attractions up to three hours. In short, in six hours we had managed to get on the pirates of the Carabian ride and Tron. Both were very good, however Tron was rather short! There was a lack of characters around the park itself, throughout the entire day I didn't see Mini or Mickey once! The castle itself never even had characters nearby! The food in the park is bog standard take away options, but reasonably priced. Overall what could have been a lovely day was ruined with huge waiting times.  "
899,3.0,Jun 2017,"Marietta, GA ",Have a magical day... waiting in line!,"My family from Georgia, United States, had a mixed experience at Shanghai Disney during our visit on June 12-13, 2017, mainly because there were not enough attractions for the number of people at the park. We stayed at the Toy Story Hotel nearby and made the mistake of not arriving early at the park. I'm guessing you need to get to the gates a half hour or so before they open at 8 am - we were lining up at around 9:30 and didn't get inside the park until 10-10:30 because there is a long security line and then a long line at the actual gate. The best attractions fill up quickly, and all Fast Passes were distributed by noon. Also, you are only allowed to select one Fast Pass at a time (after a 30-45 minute wait in line), all ticket holders must be present to receive a Fast Pass (this is to deter the Fast Pass black marketers), and you must wait two hours to receive another Fast Pass. Even though we were there on rainy days, the crowds seemed undeterred, and the park app showed afternoon lines in excess of 1 hour at all the attractions, even the less popular ones. The most popular attractions were 3 hours plus.I think my misery peaked on the second day when we waited 90 minutes for a 2-minute Peter Pan ride while holding my sleeping 2-year-old (same as the ride in the US, by the way). We weren't able to go on the highly recommended Soaring attraction because of the wait times, and I believe that is one ride you should try to do very early in the day. The best experiences we had came down to pure luck. For example, we happened to be near the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction late one day when they reopened the line, so we were able to dash through for two quick trips. Maybe this is a rare thing to have happen, but you might try lurking around the entrances to the most popular attractions around closing time to see if any short-line ""bargains"" pop up.All the shows are in Mandarin Chinese, but still very enjoyable, Disney-quality productions. Don't miss the Jack Sparrow stunt show. I also liked the Star Wars exhibit, which seemed tucked away and unappreciated by the mostly local crowd. I mean, no wait to have your photo taken with Darth Vader and C3PO... how cool is that? (Chinese Vader says ""hao, hao"" in that creepy mechanical voice)The parade is worth seeing (we took a spot along the route in Tomorrowland about 20 minutes before it started and had a good view) and the character lunch at the Royal Banquet Hall was a relaxing break from the crowds and long lines, if you don't mind shelling out more than 1000 Yuan for a 4-person meal. Overall a good park, but crowds and long lines limited what we were able to do and made it a mediocre experience. Until the FastPass system is improved and there are more attractions to absorb the crowds, I won't be going back."
900,1.0,Jun 2017,N/A,I've seen them all -- and this is the worst... in the WORLD!,"Don't be dissuaded by my negativity.  If you have any specific questions, I'll care to elaborate but let me tell you this:  There is no down days or 'off' days when the Chinese come to Disneyland.  They will show up in masses -- and this place will be jammed packed by 9am.  So let me tell you 3 things you will find at this Disneyland vs the rest of the world:1) This place is very small (1st stage only) for now. And if you are familiar with how the fast pass system works let me tell you the Soarin' ride IS without a doubt the most frequented ride in SH Disneyland -- they will be entirely unavailable by 9am.  That's right, Every time slot for the whole day will be filled in 1 hour. 2) Disneyland has employed only a handful of security guards to work the front entrance.  It will take you an hour to get through the first que (security), unless you arrive within an hour before gates open. It's pathetic. 3) Unlike the rest of the entire world, Disneyland SH will not limit the number of tickets sold in the day.  If you decide to arrive lat morning around 9 or 10 -- I wish you the best of luck.  The major 3 or 4 rides will be out of Fastpasses, and the wait times will be well over 180 minutes.  4) You cant trust the app.  If the minute counter says 210 minutes fughetaboutit!  That could mean 400 minutes.  OK 4 things.  Spend you money elsewhere.  Shanghai Circus on Line 1 is amazing and half the money as Crappyland in Shanghai."
901,1.0,Jun 2017,N/A,Not suitable for foreign visitors ,Purely cater for the domestic market. People at the park are rude and all fast ticket are being controlled by the mafia even have people selling counterfeit in the park itself and not one seem to bother by it not even the park staff.
902,4.0,Jun 2017,"Mumbai, India, ",Great but too crowded,"Visited the Shanghai Disneyland on Monday and the first disappointment was the rain which lasted throughout the day.Then, it took us more than an hour to enter the Park as we had to get in queues twice for security check & entrance ticket check.After our entry, we went to the Marvel section, Troy in Tomorrowland, Jet Pack, Pirates of the Caribbean, Camp Discovery, etc.While we had all fun despite the showers, our wait time in Tron was 240 minutes and JetPack was 60 minutes which ate up a large part of our day.The highlight of the visit was Tron which despite the long wait was an awesome ride. I persuaded my family to go for the ride and they all were glad later that they went for it.Don't miss Tron. Two advises for visitors :-a) Reach prior to 8 am so that you can get the fast pass, it saves hell of a time.b) Carry your mobile phones for Tron so that you can capture images / videos of the beautiful atmosphere and the ride tracks."
903,4.0,Jun 2017,United Kingdom ,Disney in the rain ,"Despite the ridiculously wet weather (I think we chose the only day it would rain in June) we thoroughly enjoyed our time at disney! We didn't go on the rides as we had our 7 month old daughter with us, but we decided to buy a passport and find the locations to fill it in... this way we got to see the whole park. One slight downside is that you are unable to take pushchairs into any of the attractions... very annoying when you have a sleeping child... also some of the shows, it said doors close 10 minutes before but some of them won't let you in if there's 15 minuteswe are our meal at The fast food place near the tron ride and it was delicious! We ordered a kids meal and an adult meal, and actually they were the same size (so would recommend this as a way to keep the costs down) There is also a facility for babies near the first aid centre where you can breastfeed, feed and change your baby (although you can change them in the disabled toilets located around the park), it was very clean and the staff friendly (although they don't speak English, so be prepared with your Chinese) the only problem I had was it was far too hot! They need to turn on the aircon! We will definitely be returning when our daughter is older! "
904,5.0,Jun 2017,"San Carlos, CA ",Disney lovers will not be disappointed,"This is the 5th notch in our Disney belt and it did not disappoint.  It covers more ground than Hong Kong and Anaheim, and offers different options to the same theme: Tron instead of Space Mountain, an updated Pirates that is spectacular, Soaring over China.  Our day wasn't too crowded, but there were still 120-150 minutes for some lines, so we missed a few things.  You need to organize your rides and the need for FastPasses. There is even a high-ropes course area. It was a fun change of pace so wear decent shoes and you can go.  "
905,1.0,Jun 2017,N/A,Outrageous!,"In our stay in Shanghai we decide to visit Disneyland last Saturday. I noticed several bad reports in the Tripadvisor, but the good ones were a lot bigger and we wanted to get our daughter there, her first time at Disneyland. Well the experience was not as we imagined and we regret a lot for getting our daughter there! The place was so crowded, clearly with more people that it could bear! Immense queues to get in the entertainments, waiting time ranging between 120 and 180 min! We couldn't tolerate such long waiting time, we felted not respected at all. The food was also of a very low standard and expensive! In the food court near Tron I tried the worst burger I have ever tasted! Why not have MacDonald's or Burger King doing the professional work? Clearly the goal of Disney Shanghai is to put as many people as they can inside to maximize their profit not caring about the quality of their service or even for people's safety! Two hours standing in a queue with kids? Is this the respect that Disney pays to their customers? That was a very bad joke! How many entertainments we could get in one day waiting such as long time? This was the far most outrageous situation that I had ever faced in a theme park before. And I never could imagine finding it at Disneyland! I felt so sad for disappointing my daughter and completed cheated for have paid for a service that I haven't had. It was a sunny day and the place was so crowded with so many people with umbrellas bumping you around that we decided to leave by 4 pm before have an eye punctured. And about those Excellent comments? Now I realized that they were too professional to be from a real customer..."
906,1.0,Jun 2017,"Sopot, Poland, ",One of the biggest mistakes during my long holiday ,"I was first time in Disneyland and definitely the last one. It was a Friday, not bank holiday, not summer and between 9:00 and 19:00 I have managed to use 4 attractions! It is big misunderstanding! First 90 minutes staying in queue for security,  purchasing tickets and entrance. No organisation at all! Then 90 minutes to attraction nr 1, 120 minutes to attraction nr 2, over 180 minutes to third one and when I finished the last it was getting dark. And it was with only small break for some expensive snack. I was in many amusement parks in the world as for example Six Flags in USA or Tivoli in Copenhagen. Dianeyland Shanghai is big misunderstanding. They are not prepared for such big amount of tourists. There is not enough attractions. For this nr of visitors it should be 4 times larger. Please avoid it because you will feel as a fool as me. I feel honestly cheated. Shame of you management and owners ! Never again."
907,5.0,May 2017,"Shenzhen, China ",Too much fun!,"We were there when the weather was sunny but not too hot.  The crowd was not what one would consider bad, for this location, that is.  E.g. We had a 30 min. wait for a ride a friend's cousin waited 2 hours for.  It was a blast!  Rides, attractions, activities of all sorts.  Most lines were minimal in length.  Tip:  On the Pirates ride, if you want to have a short wait, take the singles line.  Even if you are with a friend or two, the wait is cut beyond significantly.  You may even end up in the same 'boat.'  The Dwarfs Mine roller coaster has some action.  Some intense curves; not a 'wicked' ride but still with action.  If your friends scream, have them sit ahead of you!  (Then you can save your hearing a laugh at them from behind.)  There's so much to the place you can't see it all in one day.  I can't wait to go back!!Another tip:  Go on a weekday, when schools are in session, but not at the beginning or end of seasonal pass times.  The park says it opens at 8:00, but you can get in line for security, etc., before that.  (It will also test your patience for the lines you will encounter on some rides.)  "
908,2.0,Jun 2017,"Edinburgh, UK ",Falling far short of Disney's usual standards,"Shanghai Disneyland was the only Disney park worldwide I had left to visit. I'm glad I had been to the others first because if this was my first experience of a Disney park I don't think I'd be returning.The infrastructure is totally inadequate to deal with the numbers attending. This is not an inherent issue with the large numbers, as Tokyo Disneyland functions well with similar attendance. To enter the park you initially queue to go through security, this take between 30 minutes to an hour so even if you arrive before opening time do not expect to get in for it. The crowds are uncontrollable and very slow moving. After security, thankfully the ticket gates are quicker although still slow compared to the other parks (if you have purchased your tickets online you go straight to the ticket gates where they will print off your actual ticket upon showing your passport).They have tried to reinvent the wheel with Shanghai Disneyland, and in many respects made things largely nonfunctional. Fastpasses, usually distributed at one area per ride, have been grouped into land distribution areas, resulting in queues often rivalling that of the rides you are trying to get on to quicker. You can buy additional fastpasses, something that is not done at other Disney parks and I believe goes against the spirit of them (this was in response to guests selling theirs within the park). Single rider lines also do not work here, and are often only 5-10 minutes shorter than the main queue. The queues for rides ranged between 30 minutes and 3 and a half hours, with many taking longer than the listed wait time. 8 would strongly recommend downloading the Shanghai Disneyland app before you go. Their is so-do throughout most of the park and it constantly updates with queue times.The cast members unfortunately have little control over the Chinese guests who duck under barriers to get ahead in the queue, push through to board the ride and get into loud arguments with others in competing queues (while queuing for Pirates alone three arguments broke out in the queue that cast members were unable/did not do anything about).Sadly, the guests also treat the park with very little respect. Piles of trash can be found in queues (often only a few metres from a bin) and guests spit in both queues and while walking around the park. I even saw one man selling either second-hand, counterfeit or stolen Minnie Mouse ears out of his backpack in plain sight near Mickey Avenue (the Main St equivalent). You can also expect to be repeatedly pushed by the other guests.All of this is an even greater shame because some of the rides are really good. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride (go into this treating it like an entirely new ride, it is completely different from the other pirates rides worldwide although there are some smart nods to its predecessors) had possibly the best effects of any Disney ride I have been on. The scale and execution is amazing. Similarly, the Tron roller coaster is one of a kind and exhilarating, although the locker system is chaos (particularly concerning if you are trying to make a fastpass slot, it took me roughly half an hour to get a locker). Peter Pan's flight is the classic ride with some new technological additions that made it all the more magical.In terms of food, there are no vegan (and, I think, vegetarian, halal or kosher) food options. Fruit is not available anywhere around the park that I could see.As such a huge Disney fan, it saddens me how much this park lets down the Disney brand and I hope that they find a way to fix the issues I have listed above. I will not be returning until they do, however."

911,1.0,Jun 2017,N/A,Honestly worst day in Shanghai,"It's weird to read other people recommending going on a rainy weekday to avoid large crowds. My partner and I did just that and we were still faced with impossible queues (some had wait times of more than 3 hours). We completely gave up on other rides after waiting 1 hour 45 mins to go on Tron, a ride that lasted less than 2 minutes. 3 people sneakily pushed infront of us in the queue, one in particular decided to press her body against mine and fake cough to get me to step aside. The food is terrible and expensive and staff were not very helpful, with one person being quite rude when we asked them to repeat what they were saying. We did enjoy the Star Wars launchpad and taking photos with Kylo Ren and Darth Vader. This exhibition centre is tucked away in a corner in Tomorrowland so wasn't as crowded as the other spots. Overall we were sorely disappointed with the experience. Don't bother. Save up for another Disneyland. If you still decide to spend the money to visit the Shanghai one, don't have any expectations. Oh, and download the Shanghai Disney Resort app - so much better than a paper map and also displays wait times for rides. "

916,1.0,Jun 2017,"Leeds, UK ",Too many people!!,"Let me start by saying I've spent a long time in China and I am aware of the crowds and number of people here. Disneyland Shanghai is nothing but a money making playground of bumping into rude people, the most ridiculous umbrellas popping out of nowhere and into your face (any chance Disney of letting us know how many eyes were put out last year???), oh and bumping into more people. Queuing is required for everything from moving 1 meter to one side, to waiting for water, to waiting up to 3 hours on a ride that may or may not break half way through, rides that last around 90 seconds. How on earth a stampede does not occur when I imagine 100's of thousands of people are leaving at 8:15pm is beyond me.  Why on earth do you have limitless tickets to be sold each day? People genuinely cannot enjoy this place, anyone rating this place 5 star, either rented the place out for the day for themselves, or have been paid to rate it. Other than the fact this place has created a stupid amount of jobs for Chinese people, it's hard to pick out any positives. The Tron ride was great, the only ride it was possible to get a fast pass for unless you arrive within seconds of opening. The fireworks display was also great - other than having to stand in the same place for an hour, you can't move an inch as it seems other tourists are happy to breath on your neck. Staff were miserable, but I don't think you really care. The place is massive and even with a 2 days pass you couldn't cover everything, unless on a VIP pass. People want a good experience Disney. HK's Disney was 100's of times better than this. Shanghai was more of a nightmare on elm street experience. My advice people is to enjoy Shanghai as the great city it is. Forget visiting Disney here.

917,5.0,May 2017,"Boynton Beach, Florida ",Shanghai Disney for western seniors,"After reading the tripadvisor reviews we, 2 seniors in their 60s and 70s from Palm Beach Florida, were worried about crowds and lines. We went on a Friday.We took the Shanghai Metro, Line 11 . easy english directions when you push the upper right button on the ticket machine. The metro has full security at entry, so no worries travelling. Announcements and signs in English. Do as they say and buy your return Metro tickets from the machines as you exit the metro.We did not travel during rush hour as we arrived at our hotel jet lagged the night before after a 16 hour flight. On our 1pm metro train we had seats. No lines at entry bagcheck. As tripadvisor recommended we brought only packaged snacks and they were not taken away.we walked right to online tickets with passports, No wait.As we have annual passes to Orlando Disney we were less concerned with seeing every ride, so did not mind that fast passes were long gone.We waited 20 minutes on the single rider line for Pirates, our only ride. Most rides had a 2 hour wait.We enjoyed the Alice Maze, climbed on the Pirate ship (all not in Florida) and the 3pm parade. Best was watching the thousands and thousands of Chinese families. We saw less then 10 westeners, so few that I with my red hair was an attraction and had my picture taked with young chinese children.We enjoyed our hours walking around Shanghai Disney. You have to ask for a bag if you buy a gift.We left at 730pm avoiding the huge after fireworks crowd. Again, seats on the train.So, if you just want to experience the park and don't care about every ride, come later in the day. Park was clean,some cast members spoke english, and everything lights up at dusk."
918,5.0,Jun 2017,N/A,Great for a one day Disney adventure,"My wife and I visited Shanghai Disneyland for the 1st time last Friday and were impressed with the variety of new attractions as well as some old favorites.  First, locals told us to be prepared for long lines and that was true going through security and ticketing.  Guest push and shove to the front of the line like Shanghai taxi drivers in rush hour traffic, but once inside we did not wait for any attraction longer than 40 minutes which is great if you compare it to Disneyland California on any given weekend.  We highly recommend the new pirates of the Caribbean ride and the Tron lightcycle coaster.  Both were cutting edge and unique rides.  The Tarzan show is also a must as it is a mini cirque style production with highflying acrobatics.  We considered the park a pretty good value at about $350 RMB each which is about $58 USD.  Guests from the west should note that the Marvel and Star Wars areas are more like educational museum displays to get locals up to speed on and build interest in the genre.  All in all a really good one day adventure East Meets West Disney Style."
919,4.0,Jun 2017,"Sequim, WA ",We've seen them all!,"Spent two days at Disneyland Shanghai with my honey. Bought a two day senior ticket in advance and saved a few bucks. Shanghai Disneyland is a large property and most of the guests rush around to see as much as possible. The wait for the “fast pass” line was nearly 90 minutes, so we headed directly to the attraction. Found the Tarzan and Pirates shows were well done, even though they are not in English. The Pirates of Caribbean, Soaring over the Horizon and Tron attractions are new and updated to other Disney properties and worth the wait to see/ride.We took the Metro Brown Line #11 for less than one USD directly to the Disneyland Station which crosses all the other Metro trains. If you are staying at the Toy Story hotel there is a free dark blue hotel bus located in the terminal to the right of the Metro Station that will take you to the two Disney Hotels on the property. A free luggage check is available if your room is not ready because check-in is at 15:00 and you want to head to Disneyland. We ate in the Toy Story restaurant and it was average. WiFi was included, but be aware that Google products such as Gmail are blocked in China."
920,3.0,Jun 2017,"Vancouver, Canada ",Long line ups,"We wanted to take our toddler to Disneyland for her birthday but after reading reviews- there's lots of walking, no shade, long lineups, pushy people and better to go on a rainy day. So we went a few days before her birthday on a rainy day.Even on a cold miserable day there were a lot of people and a couple very pushy ones but not as bad as I thought it would be. We were told upon entering the park no English maps but later in the afternoon at a guest services station I spotted some. Most attendants, even the ones manning rides, do not speak English. One cast member kept yelling at my daughter and when I stepped in she started to yell at me. Finally I said, we do not understand Chinese. Please do not assume that all Asians speak Chinese. Many westerners who visited the park pointed out that lack of English was a big problem. The park was pretty clean. There were many workers with brooms and dustpans. We did see tons of people littering even though there was a trash bin 1 foot away. Another turnoff were little boys peeing in line. This is not only unsightly but also unsanitary. It is the norm here as no one seemed to mind. Yuck! The restrooms we used were pretty clean. We did go on the rides we wanted to go on and because of the bad weather it was less crowded by late afternoon but we were wet and exhausted by then. The only ride we did not go on was Soaring. Even in the late afternoon the lineup was long. My husband and daughter waited more than 30 mins in the rain even though they posted it was a 20 min wait. They gave up since it was cold and after 30 mins it appeared it would be another hour or so. Beware- To get into the park you have to go through 3 different lines (security, ticketing, and then entering the park) that took over an hour. Crazy! Fast pass lines are super long. We got one for Tron and because of the weather the regular line was a 25 min wait.I have been to all Disneylands worldwide since I'm a huge fan. I am glad  we went to Shanghai Disney but we do not plan on returning anytime soon."
921,5.0,Jun 2017,"Singapore, Singapore ",Shanghai Disneyland Worth to Visit,"Compare to Japan Shanghai Disney land ticket is cheaper. Its a big spacious place to have fun. We arrived at 10am and not face so much crowd issue during security check. In one day you cannot cover whole disney land but can cover most of top rides. Tron was super fun and pirate of Caribbeans, Roaring over the horizon are the best rides. For vegetarians, you can find veg burger options near the Tron ride stargaze restaurant. Food is slight expensive compare to outside. Only below 600ml water bottle is allowed while entering in Disneyland. Be ready to walk a lot as its really big place. For me it was not that much  crowded what i expected. You should try to finish most of crowded ride before 2pm as after that most of rides wait time will be between 50 to 75 minutes. All fast passes will be finish before 1pm."
922,4.0,Jun 2017,"Gainesville, FL ","Was expecting more, still a fun time","Shanghai Disneyland recently celebrated its one-year anniversary of being opened and truthfully, I expected a little more out of a park that was also recently built. Still a fun time (it's Disney!). Pirates of the Caribbean and Tron are MUSTS. Expect super long lines so plan your fast passes out accordingly. We couldn't even get on Soarin' because the line wouldn't budge from 2 hours. We were surprised to see the park so full on a Wednesday."
923,4.0,May 2017,N/A,Shanghai Disneyland,Visited with kids. Was very crowded as there was chinese holiday. Must go if you have kids. Not much waiting line so it's ok if you buy tickets there. But lots of walking so if you have small kids better take a stroller for them. carry only packed food if you want to take food with you.
924,2.0,Jun 2017,"Shanghai, China ",Disorganised and too busy,"This may be a good place to go on a cold and rainy day but unfortunately we went on a Saturday when the weather was nice and the pollution was low. The good parts: The toilets were quite nice for China!The bad: The queues! It took 45 minutes to get in and then we realised that was just security! We had been in a queue to join a queue. So then we joined the next line to actually enter the park. Overall it took around an hour to even get in. It didn't need to be like this, but the queues were disorganised with too many queue jumpers and there was only one security person for each line checking every bag. I have no problem with checking bags but put enough people on to do it. Next we thought we would get a fast pass for the rides we really wanted to go on, but the queues for a fast pass were almost as long as the line for the ride itself. There are just too many people here still and some lines were over 2 hours long. I'm sure the rides are great if you can get on them, but with a 6 and 7 year old in tow there is no way we are going to join lines that long. We figured we would go and see some of the shows instead. If you decide to do the same be aware that they are all in Mandarin. We had expected that but thought there might be English subtitles like they have in Hong Kong Disney. They don't. People also have no regard for your childrens' safety and grown men were barging past and running to get the best seats in the house to watch a frozen sing a long! My tip is get a seat near an exit so you can leave easily.Overall it was not a fun day. Such a shame as I had high hopes of getting a season pass but that will not be happening. Even my kids asked if we could leave when we had only been there 2 hours (one of which was spent lining up to get in).In summary, if you like lining up, being pushed around and poked in the eye numerous times with umbrellas, then head to Disney, you will have a great time, but if you appreciate a bit of personal space (even just a few centimetres) then avoid it!"
925,4.0,Apr 2017,"Papamoa, New Zealand ",A Place of Dreams,"Although we arrived as the park was opening, and the queues were long there were very few windows open to buy tickets. We only found out later that if you wanted to go through queues quicker you could buy a FastPass on top of the price of entry. This is not explained as you enter the park, and has very limited numbers and gives priority access - not a good way of being fair to all. A revenue grab if you ask me.Very confusing and very expensive, and guess what - very little understanding of English. Queue jumping and pushing and barging seem to be part and parcel of the culture.For the size of the Park, there were a lot of open spaces and compared to other similar parks, and a lot less rides. We had a good time once we got through all of this. Two best rides were the Pirates of the Caribbean Ride and the Tron ride. The Roaring Rapids was an extremely long wait for a very short ride, The closing light show is well worth waiting for. Although we enjoyed the rides, sights and shopping it could have been better, You really do need to sort the queues and have people who do understand English."
926,1.0,May 2017,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ","Not Magical, No Pixie Dust","Visiting China was such an emotional strain for me, after being scammed on buying stuff, but I wouldn't be in Shanghai again, if not for Disneyland. I wanted to complete all my Disneyland visits in the world, and Shanghai being the latest, I had to visit!Crews do not smile, unfriendly - out of 10, perhaps only one will smile, but that does not include greetings. Why? Because I look Chinese? Anyway, I just had to share this, being a BIG fan of Disneyland. Disneyland is supposed to be the happiest place on earth for everyone! Security was rude. If Security can't explain in English why I was not allowed to enter to a place where I thought I can buy some stuff, then the least the crew who was next to him should do so rather than letting him shouted at me and my family.I bought quite a bit of stuff from Shanghai Disneyland. My purchase of biscuits had ants in it. Yes, I wrote to them, shared with them how I was treated, the unhappy crews, besides the ants in the biscuits......they said they would compensate RMB65.00 with 3 fastpass to Shanghai Disneyland again. This is so humiliating. Why can't they tell me what they would do instead, to make the place magical again, ask where exactly where are the spot of the unfriendly Security and crew...etc etc, rather than treating me so cheaply in return.I love Disneyland, even with such treatment, I will visit other Disneyland in other parts of the world again, but not Shanghai. This is really sad! And it's going to take some time for my family and I to believe again........the magic of Disney!!!Visit Disneyland in other parts of the world, think twice, if you want to visit this one :-("
927,5.0,Jun 2017,"Phoenix, AZ ",I had a wonderful time!,"The Shanghai Disneyland has everything you expected, plus more.  The TRON ride, which you sit like you are riding a bike is the most awesome ride.  Pirates ride is great as well.  There is something for everybody.  It has plenty of rooms for families and strollers, rest rooms, etc.  A family with young children will not have any problem in it.   We spent almost all days there and barely hit 10% of the theme park.  It is also adjacent to a mall with excellent restaurant choices (in case you don't want to eat inside Disneyland)."
928,3.0,Apr 2017,New York ,Not as bad as the reviews say,"Although Shanghai Disneyland is not the perfect park with it's lack of attractions and overcrowding, it is definitely not as bad as the reviews would make it out to be. There are probably three or four major attractions and the lines can be absolutely insane if you do not arrive early. My biggest piece of advice would be to get on the single rider lines especially at Tron and Pirates of the Caribbean. This cuts off a great deal of time. The crowds can be overbearing however I did not personally experience the pushing and shoving some others have experienced. Remember there is not a lot of English spoken in the park whatsoever. I asked one of the security guards were the taxis were and they didn't even know what that meant.Overall I would recommend the park just understand that it is not filled with attractions and the ""Disney"" standards may not be prevalent."
929,4.0,May 2017,"Greenville, WI ",Has the best Disney ride,"This is a tough review.  The park was decent.  Some different attractions then US based Disney parks.  Or a little different instead of the tea pots, there is honey pots. I think Pirates is the best ride at any Disney park (been to Tokyo, FL and CA).  It is such a different experience then other Pirate rides.  Tron was also amazing.  Castle was huge.  They had a great way to take photos of the castle.  Almost tiered rows in front of it.  They offered photopass which you could buy for just a day.  At about $32 US for a day we thought it was a good option.  We bought it both days. We spent 2 days in the park and had plenty of time to see everything.  We were also there on a Friday and Saturday in late May so it might be less crowded during the week.  Some say the pricing was high.  Compared to US based Disney parks, I thought the meals was right inline.  I though beverages was much cheaper, about half the price.  I heard of the Chinese culture and the line cutting and no respect for the personal space, that is true and you need to know it before you go.  My 4 star review doesn't reflect upon that.  I would have given it a 5 star with one exception.  There are many people in the park who are unauthorized selling merchandise.  It was an annoyance.  Even in line for the security people would walk through pushing you out of the way to sell keychains or headbands.  I don't know why Disney does not crack down on this.  As soon as you exit the resort transportation bus there are people selling items.  Even inside the castle there was a man selling items out of his backpack."
930,4.0,May 2017,"Mississauga, Canada, ",Disney Does It Again But On a Smaller Scale,"I went midweek and qualified for the senior [65+] admission price. I queued up over an hour for Pirates of the Caribbean, having been directed to the singles line. The family/group line went a lot faster so don’t be mis-directed. I loved the ride, much longer and more computer special effects than what I have experienced previously in Hong Kong or Orlando. It was odd hearing Jack Sparrow speak only in Mandarin. I also tried the lagoon canoe excursion which was fun, the helmsman speaking only in Mandarin of course. Then the wait times became increasingly long [I missed out on the Fast Pass option] so did the Star Wars and Marvel Universe pavilions, the latter heavily promoting Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. I had lunch at the popular Tangled Tree Tavern which served OK food. The climax of the visit was the late afternoon parade on Main Street USA. Loud speakers implored observers to refrain from smoking along the route [there are dedicated smoking areas in the park [one near TRON]. This Disneyland is clearly going to be expanded but at present is fairly compact. This can make for a crowded venue and long lines at peak times. Still I rated it as a good value day out."
931,5.0,May 2017,"Longfield, UK ",For those with disabilities ,"Unfortunately it was bank holiday which  I did not realise until I arrived in China. I booked our tickets in the U.K. through Expedia, which then directed us to the Chinese company Variarts.  In order to be a be admitted to the park, we just had to turn up with our passports. We arrived at 7:15 in the morning then queued for approximately half hour, once in the park we rushed to the fast pass station in fantasy land I had not realised that we could only get fast passes for each area by attending the fast pass station that's in that area, so unfortunately we could not get the fast pass for soaring there so we chose the Pinocchio ride. We then rushed to Pirates of the Caribbean there was only a five minute wait so basically went straight on the ride from there we went to Tron and were on the ride within 20 minutes. It seems everybody had headed straight for the fast pass area for soaring, The fast passes had run out by mid morning, The queues remained huge for both rides all day often a three hour wait in baking hot sunshine!!!!!We had attended customer services the day before to check on the tickets and also to ask about assistance as I have walking difficulties with my back, I was told we could hire a wheelchair for 70CNY, but we decided to see how I managed we were also told there was no easy access for people in wheelchairs. By mid morning I was having problems with my back so I asked some of the park workers if my son could stand in the queue and I could join him at the entrance  when he got there and was told on numerous occasions this was not possible so we had two choices, both queue, or miss out on the rides all together. However short time later we came across an American worker who was head of a department and explained the problem he took us to customer services whereupon we had our Photos taken and were given a pass so that we could go to a customer service station by the ride and they would book us in for a specific time to return where upon we could go straight on the ride of our choice. This system is similar to those in the US. So for people with disability or mobility problems you need to go straight to the customer services just passed the ticket booth on the right hand side. It's interesting how customer services outside the park categorically told us that this assistance was not possible however once we got to the customer service inside the park with the help of the American worker, It was all sorted, we were able to have a great day and able to attend nearly all of the rides. One of my favourite rides was The Pirates of the Caribbean The visual effects were amazing they have apparently won many awards. Tron was also great be it scary! Soaring was a stunning  virtual reality ride suitable for everyone! We got our position by the bridge 45 minutes before the start of the light and firework show we sat in front of railings by the Waffle House which meant nobody could get in front of us and had a wonderful view. So altogether a great day!!!My tip definitely don't go on weekends, bank holidays or School holidays, and if noneone in your party speaks Chinese (my son is fluent) get Google translate, make sure you download a VPN in England before you enter China as Google is not allowed in China however with the VPN app turned on it is possible to get Google, Facebook, Instagram and anything else you would normally use in the UK. Most Chinese people have extremely limited knowledge of the English language. We stayed in the Novatel clover which was a beautiful hotel just 20 mins away and as of 1 June has outdoor swimming pool to relax in if you are visiting for a few days, it also has the shuttle bus that's  free to take you to the Disney land and also the airport. Make sure you pre-book as spaces  fill up fast.Feel free to ask any questions hope this helps 😜"
932,3.0,May 2017,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ",Rainy Day at Fantasy Land,"Not my favourite theme park experience. Disneyland supposed to be cheerful, happy and all smiles~ BUT I don't feel it here. Maybe there are too many visitors and the staffs are all stressed out. All are grumpy and impatient to the max. "
933,2.0,May 2017,"Cambridge, UK ",Great potential but no currently worth visiting,"Firstly I would like to say I love Disney I have visited Orlando, Hong Kong and Paris before this park, both during school holidays and off peak however nothing prepared me for the wait times at this park. The lines are over two hours long each for most of the popular attractions (I went for two days midweek), I suggest arriving before park opening as when you enter there were people running to the fast pass machines. Given that fast passes run out within an hour of ride opening for Soaring and Roaring Rapids I can understand why. The shows were acrobatic based and fun although translations by headset or surtitles like other Disney parks would have been very welcome. There were many incidences of line jumping and this caused a large number of arguments. There were a large number of touts and hawker's selling Disney items that were definitely not Disney employees. Given the really long security lines I can only assume that staff are being bribed to allow entry as all bags are checked.  I also went for a character breakfast at Lumier's Kitchen where I only had photos with three characters the food was generally good except for the hash browns which were inedible. This is the only Disney I would not recommend to visit, the rides are fun and the park beautiful but the park is simply not up to Disney standards and is the worst equipped for foreign guests. I can understand why this park is so popular given the difficulty of Chinese tourists to get travel visas to visit other parks but for everyone else avoid at least until Disney make more rides and exercise better standards at the park."
934,4.0,Apr 2017,San Francisco ,Wonderful experience but not my happy place,"Exciting experience.  Pirates of the Caribbean was wonderful and not to be missed, different from every other parks attraction.  Unlike Hong Kong and Paris, all of the shows and attractions were in Chinese with like or no English.  However, cast members had some English and were very kind.  Crowds can be a bit pushy and line jumping accepted.  "
935,4.0,May 2017,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ",Magical Place - Almost,"Almost a magical place if not spoilt by the staff managing the queue at the TRON Light Cycle. We were told to split up as we were in the single queue (?). After much argument (and that was our first ride!), we decided to ignore his orders as what he told us was completely different from his colleague. Being one of the fastest rides in all Disney Parks, it is the coolest in Shanghai's. Download the Disneyland APP so that you know how much waiting time is there for each ride or activity. Pace yourself so you do not miss out the characters parade like we did. For smokers, the designated smoking areas are mostly near to the washrooms; so do not be despair. Be prepared to pay exorbitant prices inside the park for food and beverage. Alternatively, can check it Toastbox or Breadtalk cafe just outside the park if you do not mind the security check for re-entry. 8pm fireworks not to be missed though it is not as spectacular as we had imagined it. Still, it is the highlight before bidding farewell to the magical kingdom."
936,3.0,Mar 2017,"Melbourne, Australia ",A very average version of Disney,"My husband and daughter dragged me along to this Disney theme park after an incredibly long train ride from Shanghai's Nanjing station.  We finally arrived at about 2.00pm and of course, had to queue forever to buy tickets because they only had 3 ticket windows open (whilst about 9 remained closed)!Once inside the queuing continued for the rides - there weren't that many really - with general waiting times of over an hour.Because we only had limited time we only went on 3 rides - Buzz Lightyear (which was great fun), Pirates of the Caribbean (OK I guess) and the Crystal Grotto boat ride which was nice but nothing special. To board all these rides we waited over half an hour so we were pretty tired and jaded by the end of it.This park might be better in years to come when they add some more rides and make the queues shorter. My child is 20 but I certainly wouldn't want to be queuing for that length of time with small children who get impatient and tired (we had to deal with them in the queues...)If you're going to Asia, visit Disney Sea in Tokyo instead - it is truly a magical place to visit.  Alternatively, Ocean World in Hong Kong is pretty special too, with no queues!"
937,5.0,May 2017,"Taizhou, China ",Go on a rainy weekday.,"I visited Shanghai Disney on my second day visiting Shanghai. I must say that this was my first visit to any Disneyland, and that is saying something because I am from California. I timed my visit just right I think. I visited during a national holiday, and I knew that the lines would be horrid, but I saw that there would be a super rainy day during my trip. This turned out to be great. It didn't rain too much, but the constant drizzles kept most of the Chinese tourist away. I was able to walk onto pirates 3 times with only a 5 minute wait, and Tron twice with only a 15 minute wait!! It was also nice because it wasn't hot ether.I loved every second of my trip there, and it took me back to my childhood. If you go, plan correctly. Don't go on a weekend or national holiday because the crowds will be huge. Go on a weekday when schools are in session. If you can wing it, go while it is raining as well."
938,4.0,May 2017,"Düsseldorf, Germany ",Great fun if you plan strategically and manage your expectations,"After reading extensively here on Tripadvisor and on other blogs, I planned our day trip to Shanghai Disneyland very strategically in order to maximize our time there (10 rides, some repeated, in a 10-hour visit, plus some other attractions). My husband and I went on a Tuesday that was not on any particular holiday, not during the school holidays, and the weather was fairly cloudy in the morning. Even so, you're going to have to wait regardless of what you do, whether it's getting into the park, picking up a Fastpass, or standing in line for a ride.We left Jing'an Temple at around 7am to get to Disney at 8am with the subway, which is super easy, convenient, and cheap. We had to queue to get in, first with security and then actually showing your entry ticket, which I had bought online beforehand to save time. We got into the actual park by about 8:30/8:45am. As other people have mentioned, some people sprint into the park which is a bit unnecessary. We first went to Adventure Isle and waited an hour to get onto Roaring Rapids, which was actually our longest wait all day. We saw people selling knockoff Disney merchandise and ponchos so you wouldn't get wet, and we were literally the only people not buying ponchos. The ride was fine without it (and yes, I got wet), so I would suggest not buying one even if everyone else is.After Roaring Rapids, we went over and waited about 30 minutes to do the Camp Discovery course, which offers really nice views over the park. You can't carry any sort of backpacks or have anything in your pockets, so the waiting time was actually mostly to get a locker to put our stuff in. If you don't have any gear to put into a locker, you can actually just walk up to the entrance of the attraction and you'll end up waiting only 10 minutes or so.We made our way over to the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, which was definitely the highlight of the park. Waiting time was maybe 40 minutes and for some reason, the ride closed at 6pm that day. In the afternoon, we wound up going again twice more, once because the wait line was only 20 minutes, and directly after that by doing single rider, which had a wait of about 5 minutes. Downside to single rider is that you're on different boats, but it was a great way to maximize our time.We eventually made our way over to Tomorrowland and Tron, and this is where we actually picked up our only Fastpass tickets of the day since the Fastpass line was no more than 5 minutes. My husband isn't into roller coasters, so I took his Fastpass and rode it twice in a row with a wait time of only 10 minutes each. However, as a single rider later in the day, I didn't even need the Fastpass and also waited only 10 minutes. With Tron, a lot of blogs suggest going at night, but the majority of the ride is in the dark anyway, so I don't think it was necessary to do it at night.Other things we did with wait times:- Buzz Lightyear Planet Rescue - 20 minutes- Hunny Pot Spin - 30 minutes- Voyage to the Crystal Grotto - 45 minutes- Marvel Universe - no wait- Star Wars Launch Bay - no wait- Alice in Wonderland garden - no waitI had wanted to go on Soaring Over the Horizon and the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, but as they are also at other Disney parks and the wait never went under 120 minutes, I felt they weren't worth our time. The Seven Dwarfs Mine Train also supposedly has a single rider line, but that wasn't open the day we went. Waiting for the Fastpass in Adventure Isle and Treasure Cove made no sense to me, since the lines seemed almost as long as the rides themselves.My husband and I had a really great time at Shanghai Disneyland, but part of it was managing our expectations. Having lived in Shanghai previously for a little over a year and having been to other Disney parks, our expectation was that it wouldn't be exactly like the others. Moreover, the waiting is to be expected since it's China and there's a queue everywhere. Sure, the people selling knockoff merchandise is off-putting, some people will wait incredibly close to you, and yes, we saw one little kid peeing in a bottle while waiting on line. But if you know what you're getting into and you plan strategically, spending the day at Shanghai Disneyland is really fun and some of the rides really are unique. This is my third favorite Disney park after Orlando and Tokyo, but in terms of what you get for your money, Shanghai Disneyland wins for the best deal."

In the beginning, the staff seemed excited and happy to be there, the people were on their best behavior, and although it was crowded (it's always been crowded and always will be), it was happy.  During this last trip however, I saw China in Disneyland.  You have people selling knock-off merchandise in the ride queues, angry people pushing in line, line cutting, and the cast members seem exhausted and frustrated.  All the stuff that Disney tried so hard to keep out.  This is a huge park, most stuff for younger kids, not nearly the number of big rides as CA Disney, but still fun if you go with the right attitude.  You either have to plan a strategy to hit all the rides you want, or go with a ""whatever"" attitude.  Be ready to wait. It takes about one hour to enter the park upon arrival- security clearance and ticket verification is slow. Waiting was up to 2 hours on some rides. Fast track ticket lines can take up to one hour (so maybe you need to get a fast track ticket for the fast track line).Excellent metro access, terrible food (try to bring your own or go to a Disneytown restaurant to eat).   Still worth a visit if you have the time especially since it's half the price as CA Disneyland."
940,4.0,May 2017,"Broomfield, CO ",Very Crowded!,"Wonderful park, just very very crowded. You must arrive very early or go 90 minutes after they open, otherwise you stand in line forever.The park itself is very nice, clean and modern. Just extremely long lines even not on peak days. for $60-80 US you can buy a fastpass booklet on  Main Street which is worth it, otherwise wait 60-180 minutes for some attractions.Also, lots of people selling knockoff Disney items in the park, very annoying!"

942,4.0,May 2017,"Elizabeth, Australia ",Hectic place ,We must have picked one of the busiest days ever and it wasnt a weekend.Took half hr plus to get in and then most rides were 1hr plus waiting time.As it was our first ever Disneyland Adventure we were really looking forward to it but were a little disappointed.Good for kids and young families.
943,5.0,May 2017,"Kuta, Indonesia ",Always great!,I was told by many friends to re-think to visit the disneyland in Shanghai as it might not have any significant difference with other disneyland parks. However I found it different! They have 1 attraction named tron which might be the main attractive for those who are looking for challenge.
944,5.0,Mar 2017,"Shanghai, Shanghai, China ","Great park, go when it's raining!","I've been to Hong Kong Disney, Tokyo Disneyland twice, California Disneyland twice and Florida's Disney World five times! That makes me a sorta expert on Disney parks and total freak! What can I say about Shanghai Disneyland? Well, it's my favorite ""Disneyland"" as it's the most unique. Disney put some real effort into making this park stand out from the others as it draws on and includes local culture and tradition into the style of the park. Yes, it's still completely Disney and the Chinese influence is subtle, but it is there for those who look for it.As for the rides, they will be familiar to Disney veterans, but they are updated, modified for Shanghai or in some cases, totally original. Example: SH Disney also has Soarin (from California Adventure or EPCOT) but the experience is very unique. In this version, you get to fly over Shanghai, the Chinese Great Wall, Beijing, etc. It's wonderful if you like China. TRON is of course a 1 of a kind that's great fun. What really stood out for me at this park was Pirates of the Caribbean. I've been on this ride 20 times at other parks, but this one is in a whole class above the rest. It's immersive, visually stunning, and perhaps my favorite theme park ride anywhere (I don't know of other Disney parks have upgraded their Pirates ride to match).The food is good at every restaurant I've enjoyed, hard to go wrong here, though it is pricey. Advice: This park can be really really crowded. I highly advise you go on a week day, Mon or Tue and when local schools are in season. If you can time it to go in the rain, that's a real boon also! Ride wait times for TRON, Pirates and Soarin can exceed 2 hours. However, on rainy days, those an drop to 20-30 minutes each. Fast Passes are available but are also VERY limited and you can only hold 1 at a time. If you get there early, go straight to your favorite ride, get a Fast Pass, then hop in line quickly for something else."
945,4.0,May 2017,"Moscow, Russia ",Must visit for Disneyland fans,"The park is very modern a different from the ones in the US and Paris! It is super crowded, we arrived around 11:30 (on Friday) and were able to get only 1 fast pass. Waiting time is horribly long, we did almost 3 hours at the ""Soaring Over the Horizon"" (the ride is just like Soarin' Around the World in California Adventure park). I was shocked to see the line for Turkey Leg, I think, it was at least an hour of waiting. Other shocking  thing was: the illegal poncho distribution at Roaring Rapids! There were people in the line, who offers poncho for half price! Police was throwing them out, but they were coming back. For new and unique rides check out ""THRON Lightcycle Power Run"" it is very cool and different from other rollercoasters. And we also loved ""Challenge Trails  at Camp Discovery"". The fireworks were also amazing: short movies were projected to the castle and every performance finished with a fireworks.  You will also get a fantastic view during your trail. If you are a Disney fan - you should definitely go to this park, but be ready for an enormous amount of people and lines!"
946,3.0,May 2017,United States ,Inefficient Setup,"I'm a huge Disneyland fanatic. Anaheim Disney is my jam.Although it seemed similar in size with a similar amount of large rides (Disneyland only, not including California Adventures), the set up of the park meant that there were lines everywhere. We got to the park around 10am and rode a total of 7 rides throughout the day. No shows, no parades, etc.ENTRANCE:Bought a ticket off of Groupon for $53. Waited in the entrance line to get the ticket. Not sure why they're printing will call tickets at the front, but getting through that line queue took at least a 1/2 hour.FAST PASSES:Multiple fast passes are listed at each information place. Make sure you select English vs Mandarin, as we chose the wrong fast pass the first time and that screwed up our morning. Only one fast pass can be obtained at a time. Sometimes the fast pass line is about 1/2 as long as the standby line to get on the ride and sometimes the fast passes only drop you into the line and people still have to wait ~40 more minutes (Tron). You're essentially either waiting in line for a fast pass or to get onto the ride via standby.WAITING IN LINES AT RIDES (Monday, May 22):Soaring over the Horizon - 135 minutesRoarin' Rapids - 120 minutesPeter Pan - 60 minutesWinnie the Pooh - 65 minutesTron - 130 minutesJet pack - 60 minutesPirates of the Caribbean (better than Anaheim) - 25 minutesBuzz Light Year (same as Anaheim) - 25 minutesChallenge Trail (this one is a pretty cool ropes course) - 25+ minutes for locker since you can't take anything with you + getting onto the trailCUTTING IN LINEPeople like to cut in line and don't have a sense of personal space. My group left a bit of space in front of us and a bunch of people tried to go around us as we were standing in line. Others like to sneak ahead pretending they're looking for someone or just sneak ahead in general.FOOD:There isn't a lot and the food in which you get more is the burger place by Tron, though it's more American. I would bring in my own food."
947,4.0,Sep 2016,"Alexandria, VA ",Newest and coolest rides,"As the Disneyland in Shanghai is basically brand new, they had all the bells and whistles. I was especially impressed with the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, which was a far cry from the one I went on in California as a child. The dining experience in the castle with the characters is a bit pricey, but it was worth it to get away from the madhouse that are the other restaurant. Some quality time with the royal Disney characters was great too! I gave it 4/5 only because the crowds here don't like following the rules (cutting in line, pushing and crowding, spitting etc), which took away from the pleasure from being at Disneyland. Travel tip: go on a mild rainy day and there will be a lot less people. I can't even imagine being there on a busy day! "
948,4.0,May 2017,"Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei Darussalam ",A whole day of entertainment,"I had a great time here despite the crowd and the extremely long queue. Be prepare to queue up to 2 hours plus for a single ride without the VIP pass. My personal favourite would be Tomorrowland, the Tron ride. It was superb!! Spent one whole day there since the place is huge. Outside the park has the Disneyland Village where visitors can do some shopping for non-disney items/brands. Ended the day by watching the fireworks which was beautifully played. Can tell that Disney has invested a lot in the technology to outbid other disney parks."
949,4.0,May 2017,"High Wycombe, WA ",Tiring,"No where near as good as the original in LA, USA but wasn't expecting it to be.  Lots of time wasted on queuing up for rides - don't like that.  Our one ride was the Crystal Grotto and lining up for that was bad enough.  We're in our 60's and don't appreciate having to be treated like cattle......The general overall of Disneyland was really good, lots of space, shade and seats for the elderly which is very important.   Food was OK not overly expensive and the Disney parade at lunchtime was fantastic.  A good day and thoroughly recommended for all ages!"
950,5.0,May 2017,"Melbourne, Australia ",My First Disney,"My first visit ever to Disneyland!! We planned our trip so we could visit Shanghai Disney within its first year of being open. After what seemed like the longest train ride in history (due to excitement.. it was actually only an hour) We arrived! I was amazed! All the signs are in English and Chinese so there was no issue figuring out where to go, and all the staff spoke some level of English too. The rides have English instruction wich is all you need. It was easy enough to follow even though we couldnt understand what was being said during the ride. Pirates of the Caribbean is a must do!! We were blown away by how well it has been done. Due to our lack of planning, we wasted alot of valuable ride time shopping. Fast passes run oit by around mid day so I would reccommend getting in early amd heading straight for the buisy rides such as the 7 Dwarfs Mine, as wait times can stretch to 2 hours. Probably one of our best decisions was to leave the Grotto until dusk. It is an amazing light and sound show by boat wich would not quite be the same in daylight. Definitely coming back again to finish what we missed!! I know it can be expensive but I'd advise staying at the Disney hotel and having multi day passes to ensure you get the most from your time there without missing anything. Trains are easy to navigate to Disney and it is advised to buy your return ticket on arrival as large crowds leaving will cause chaos to purchase a ticket."
951,5.0,May 2017,"Singapore, Singapore ",It was a rainy visit,"We visited on 12/5/2017, it was not forecasted to rain but it did. Good thing the rain stopped by 2PM. Even though it was raining, we did not let it destroy our Disneyland experience!!! Best attractions - Roaring Rapids & Soaring Over The Horizon as I'm not a fan of roller coasters, although we still tried Tron. Didn't get to try the food. Of course we loved the Mickey Shop!!! Overall experience was SUPERB!!! "
952,1.0,Apr 2017,"Phoenix, Arizona, United States ",Overcrowded and far too few rides.,"Shanghai Disneyland is spread out *much* farther than the American parks meaning guests are hiking back and forth through throngs of strollers all day. In six hours, we logged 21,000+ steps and managed 3 rides (out of the 12 they have there.) In short, too many people, too few rides, and too spread out.Good news: with the exchange rate it was less than half the cost of Anaheim."
953,3.0,May 2017,"Asuncion, Paraguay",Best Disney Park,"Yes, I been to all of the parks, and this is one of the best Disney Park in the world. And now the but, the BIG but. It is in China, so people are disrespectful, they don't understand how lines work, they just cut in the middle or go in front of you in every corner, they spit, they talk loud, they come too clouse untill they touch you, there is no personal space, they throw garbage on the floor, etc.. the park is big so you have to walk a LOT. And there is just TOO many people in every atraction. I been a full day and only did 5, and it wasnt even a weekend. They will have to find a solution cause 120minutes per line it's just not acceptable. Most of the souvenirs doesn't say Shanghai, it just says Disney Parks, so i didn't buy anything. But anyways, it is Disney so i love it."
954,5.0,May 2017,"Mumbai, India ",Largest in Asia - Fresh Disneyland,"We visited on 2-May and found large queue and this was very dis-appointing for the family..... Lucky to ride the Tron with FP. Enjoyed Pirates of Caribbean and Flying Jumbo which we missed at Paris. Many new rides seen here and of Chinese feel.... People are very helpful.... Language is a big problem in China especially English.I had to upgrade my daughters ticket from child to adult as her height was 141 cms.... Even a bit was not accepted or considered.It was raining and spoiled the fun and on the top of it the crowd due to hoildays....I do not think the entrance fee is that high.... The place is nice and reachable by Metro which is a very good for travelers.We had to wait for 75 minutes for a ride which just lasted for 1 minute..... We skipped the Boat ride as the waiting time at 7 pm was still 105 minutes.....They allowed us to carry our food as we are Jain Vegetarians and this was a blessing for us. The parade was amazing and fun for children. Kids took photos with Mickey, Minnie, Princess, Donald and many more....Overall a good experience but to go only when No Holidays else get amazed to see horrible crowd to spoil your thrill...."
955,5.0,May 2017,"Gresham, OR ",Great Park,"We travelled to Shanghai specifically to visit the new Disneyland Resort and our son, who was part of the Opening Team for this great park.  There are some amazing rides, including Tron and the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.  And the Pirates stunt show, if all of the stunts are running correctly, was amazing.  But, maybe I am a bit biased since our son has been part of that show for the since opening day.  The castle is fantastic.  The fireworks show (at least those that are shot into the sky) is limited due to regulations and noise complaints.  Otherwise, if you visit this park, you can have an amazing time."
956,3.0,Apr 2017,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ",Tron & Pirates Of Caribbean is a must do!,"Shanghai Disneyland is MASSIVE! It's true what they said about this being the largest Disney Magic-Kingdom-style theme park. Park is huge, so put on your best walking shoes.Recommended ride for adults : Tron (wait time - Single Rider 60min)Pirates Of Caribbean (wait time 60min)Soaring Over the Horizon (wait time 120min)Seven Dwarfs Mine Train (wait time 120min)TRON isn't just a roller coaster. It's a storytelling concept that Disney clearly wants to get correct and as flawless as possible. You will in a position similar to riding motorbikes. The restraints on TRON hold you in place against the back, not the lap.Launch is not forceful. But as you will be in the motorbike position, you will definitely feel more exposed than you’re used to, which creates that extra intensity as you launch from approximately 0 to close to 90kmh. You will curve through the outdoor portions of the coaster before going into the show building. From this point on, it's all about disorientation as riders go from one portal to another, seemingly to finish doing so before the ""opposing team"" manages to beat them. Highlight is the special effect, it's amazing! Combine that with the amazing soundtrack by Daft Punk, this is a ride that shouldn't be missed by visitors.Those who had been on this ride before I visited the park often called this particular ride the best Disney ride ever created.  This is, without doubt, the BEST RIDE EVER!I've never seen technology anything like this in a theme park attraction before. Disney fuses screens and visual effects seamlessly with the massive set design and special, physical effects. Not to mention, the screens in this ride are Ultra High Definition and HUMONGOUS. One more impressive feature of this ride is the boats themselves. Unlike typical ride of its kind, the boats on Pirates of the Caribbean can maneuver themselves in all direction. Throughout the course, the boats move forward, backward, sideways, and even rotate in place. In addition, the boats can accelerate and slow down according to the scene sets.If there is only one ride that Disney can be proud of right now, it would be this one. Definitely a must-ride attraction of the park. 10/10.I have been to both Disneyland in Japan and Hong Kong. In Shanghai something was a miss. One thing that Shanghai Disneyland lacks is the ""magic"" and the ""charm"" of a Disney park. Pathways are wide, and the castle oddly feels out of place. There's something ""industrial"" about the park that I can't simply dismiss. Nevertheless, this is done out of necessity, given the massive population of Mainland China, as well as the consideration that local visitors tend to... errr... pile up? Another major complain that Shanghai Disneyland seems to get a lot is the pricing of the food and I agree.In short would recommend visiting at least once."
957,4.0,Apr 2017,"Houston, TX ",How we hacked Shanghai Disney [Ride All or Most Attractions in 2 days],"We found out about this Disneyland through a facebook video for travel destinations. Upon sharing this with one another we both instantly agreed to add this destination in part of our 5 asian cities tour itinerary. So we set our sights towards the end of April and gave ourselves 2 days tops to visit. For those who dont want to read all of this, the TL;DR is towards the bottom.- DAY 1 [New Atmosphere; Confusion] - Our first day, we made it to the park via taxi which was a 15 min ride around 0830 and was easily accessible after making it to the park which was centrally located and was very efficient for pick up and drop off. To our surprise there was a huge migration and a line already slowly filling up waiting for the park to open up. As soon as we got through security and admitted into the park, EVERYBODY starts running & not knowing what they were running for, we ran with them. (BIG MISTAKE). There are friendly Disney cast members peppered through the high traffic areas of the park holding ""Please walk"" signs, but no one really paid them any mind.We found out why everybody was running and that was to get to one of the fast pass stations. The one that everybody was stuffed into was in Adventure Isle since it's the closest to the park entrance. The process was smooth but efficient, we ended up getting 2 diff rides due to the confusion so we couldn't ride together, so we called it a loss and went to Tomorrow Land and rode Tron. From there we made the worse mistake and waited in line for Soarin' Horizons. We waited for 3 hours to ride a 10min ride which is like the same ride  in WDW FL but with a bit more sophisticated technology. [Had half a sphere with a 3D projector & sprayed mist/scents to make you feel immersed in what was in front of you] After that we went to Pirates of the Caribbean ride which is another exclusive ride only in Shanghai Disney. Which utilized very great technology [from Soarin Horizions but a much bigger dome like sphere with 3D projections, while you're on the water!] which is way more realistic but just like the haunted mansion at WDW FL. Please look up some POV videos on youtube about this if interested. It was hot that day, we were hungry, cranky & were tired so we ate & used the photopass from earlier in the day and went to some designated places where the photographers were and waited in long lines to get our photos taken. After that we went into cinderella's castle and took the tour. From there it was approximately 5pm and we scoped out a place to chill so we can see the fireworks.We found a spot by the bridge with the gates and lights across from the ""Haus of Waffles"" and began our 3 hour stake out since fireworks start at 8pm. Slowly but surely more people began to see what we were doing and decided to take suit. Fast forward 10 mins into the beginning of the fireworks show, a family of 6 shows up behind us & starts consistently tapping/grabbing our shoulders and proceed to TELL [NOT ASK] us move so they can take our spot on the railing to watch the show, and we did not budge. Their children were crawling all over me trying to push us away from the railing, our spot which we had stood and saved for OVER 3 Hours. I turned around, told everybody in the deepest baritone that could rattle anyone's bones and stated a profound ""NO."" from there everybody within arms length looked down and away from me and became reserved but continued to watch the fireworks. We were able to watch the rest of the show in peace. - DAY 2 [The Hack] - After the confusing experience we had from Day one, we decided to do something different and to be completely ready for Day two. Attached is the itinerary of what we did to go ride most of all the rides. Since we already did Soarin' Horizions & Pirates of the Caribbean on day one we completely eliminated them and wanted to explore the rest of the park we neglected:- Arrived at park, there were lines but not long [0700]-Park opened [0745]**Ran w/ crowd and kept running past the fast pass stations in Adventure Isle**- Rode Raging Rapids [0815]**Ran against crowd direction from raging rapids to Fantasy Land**- Rode Peter Pan's Flight [0830]**Ran/Brisk walk to Tommorrow Land Fast Pass Station** [Hardly anyone was there]  (*Acquired Fast pass for Tron Ride for 0910*)- Rode Buzz Light Year Planet Rescue [0835]- Rode Buzz Light Year Jet Pack (Similar to Dumbo)[0837]- Rode Tron W/o Fast Pass [0900]- Rode Tron again W/o Fast Pass [0915]- Rode Tron WITH Fast Pass [0930]- Rode Buzz Light Year Planet Rescue [1002]    (*Tried to get 1 million pts but got 970K*)- Got Day Photopass [1015]- Meet Mickey [1030] (Photopass)-Met Spider-Man (Marvel Universe ) [1040] (Photopass)- Did Photopass at the 8 prime shot locations while the parade is going on & meet some Disney characters/Disney Princesses [1100-1230]This is just an idea of how you can tailor your day, you can supplement what we rode with whatever that interests you, but keep this in mind since the park gets most crowded from the east side of the park [Adventure Isle] upon opening and then slowly expands to the west as the day progresses- TL;DR -  Best Tips:- Show up Early [0700]- Get One Day photopass [About $20-$24]- Have Pleco App [Chinese Dictionary] Cast member's english is limited but they try.- It's REALLY crowded & most do not understand the concept of space.- Do not let anyone cut you, if you do one then everybody else will follow! - Wi-fi only works if you take your phone out of airplane mode just to get the code to log on.- Get a sim card or hotspot [we used skyroam] the wi-fi signal was not at all reliable- Take advantage of the time during the parades since everybody is lined up watching it, to get your photos taken at the photopass locations since there won't many if not any individuals crowding your shots.This park experience was ok but it was good just to see once, we more than likely won't come back unless we're visiting in shanghai again. But the overall experience was pleasant in itself."
958,3.0,May 2017,"Adelaide, Australia ",Not as good as LA,"Good effort Disney but if you have been to LA Disneyland don't bother with this one.Rides are pretty weak.Park is packed all the time.Line up for the security check point, then a line up to get a ticket and then another line up to get in.Average wait times were 90 minutes for rides.Park isn't as big as LA.You even have to line up for 10 minutes to get a fast pass it is that crowded.The park is amazingly clean with sit down flushing toilets avaliable.Worth going if you have never been to a Disneyland and want to tick it off the list."
959,5.0,Apr 2017,"Santa Clara, CA ","Great park, but soooo many people!","Takes a while to get thru the bag check, but it was a great park to visit. Since it is really new I am assuming things will calm down eventually. The TRON ride is worth the wait! Disney needs to replicate that at their other parks. A unique an fun ride! There will be long wait times and hordes of people, but even with all the cutting & pushing the people are polite & it is not malicious. They are just on a mission. I would allow yourself a few days to visit since you will likely be waiting for the main rides for a while. Even the fast pass queues were manic. Unfortunately Pirates was closed, and it was a bit freaky to have Darth Vader going at you in Chinese but I think we understood each other. Overall still an enjoyable time!"
960,4.0,May 2017,Chennai ,Crazily crowded. You can enjoy in you are prepared for long queues.,"We went on a tuesday assuming that the crowd will be less. But it was crazy. We were in the entrance at 8.20AM and it was too crowded. We crossed the security gate in about 20 minutes and the ticket checking in about 40 minutes. Seeing the crowd we directly went to Mickey Arcade and bought the fast passes. Now Shanghai Disneyland is selling fast passes at 480 Yuans for week days for all the 7 rides. This helps you to skip long queues and there is no time restriction to enter the fast pass queue if you buy it. With the fast pass, we quickly finished all rides. the 7th ride (roaring rapids) was closed for maintenance. Luckily they opened roaring rapids in the evening and we enjoyed that too.As everyone says, Tron & pirates are the best followed by soaring over the horizon, roaring rapids. Winnie, buzz planet were too childish.Fireworks was between 8 & 8.30 pm and was good. Sitting close to the castle will give you a better view as they are projecting scenes on the castle.Best is to use a metro to reach and exit Disneyland. To reach disney, we took a taxi from our hotel. We started at 7.15am and reached at 8.20am. Traffic was crazy. In the evening, after fireworks, we took a metro from disney and reached our hotel in 40 minutes (2 lines).Note: I guarantee that you cannot finish all the rides without fast passes."
961,4.0,Jun 2016,"Singapore, Singapore ",Crazily Crowded,"Generally, I really had a great time here in Shanghai Disneyland. But thanks to the huge crowd and hour long queue, I did not have enough time to visit every of the attraction.I literally queued for 2 hours just for a damn ride. You guys must try the Tron ride. It was amazing af !!The enchanted castle is massive and beautiful.  Tips:- Purchase the entrance tickets in advance- Take metro Line 11 straight to Shanghai Disneyland. If can, please purchase shanghai public transport concession card. This can save you from buying the ticket with a huge crowd during your trip returns (after the firework shows) to the city. - Grab the fast pass as fast as you can to minimize the chance getting stuck in long queue- You are not allowed to bring your own foods into this Disney park"

There is literally no atmosphere and being big does not make it good, the original California Disneyland is still the best, even though small followed by Tokyo and Florida.If you have a spare day in Shanghai use it to go elsewhere, preferably outside of Shanghai city."

964,2.0,May 2017,"Perth, Australia ","A good try by the Chinese, but cannot stand comparison with Disney in USA , France or Tokyo","We left hotel near Shanghai Railway Station just after 6 and it was nearly an hour on the Subway, one change. The train was full and disgorged straight into the resort. It opened at 0800, and we queued for about 20 minutes for security bag-check, and it was already getting hot in the sun. Then after getting through the first gate (like going into a prison) and onto the next one for ticket check, about the same time. An hour standing before we even got in. When you are both fairly hefty, as we are, you can easily block the line to prevent people pushing in. When people were finally released into the Park most of them sprinted away towards the rides, and for the first 30 minutes or so all there was were people running in all directions, even pushing strollers at great speed, I'm surprised the tyres were not screaming.  I saw the line for Fast Track passes for the first of the rides we thought we would try ‘Soaring over the Horizon’, it was huge. But we queued for only half an hour for that ride and it was well worth seeing, a sort of iMax movie from chairs which moved around. I really enjoyed it. We then headed to the ‘Pirate of the Caribbean’ ride and the single rider line was only 30 minutes. It was a water ride with CG movie, very, very well done and good fun (though in Chinese). The third ride which D wanted to try, and was prepared to wait 3 hours for, he said, was the ‘Tron Lightcycle power run’ –only a 10 minute wait at mid-morning. You need to stow your bags in a free locker on the way in (locked with a PIN)  Anyway that ride made me decide that I would never go on another roller coaster. Crouched forward, as on a motor-bike, but securely wedged in, it reaches speeds up to 97 km/h  - no wonder I felt nauseous. But I guess I’m glad I tried it. Had I been 40 years younger I would have loved it!After that the park proved unpleasant. It was hot and humid and we could not find shade or places to get drinks, coffee unobtainable. The food is typical theme park style but drearier, give me the good old American style any day!! And the remaining rides had up to 90 min wait for them! Anyway we trudged around getting more and more negative about the place. Eventually we decided we would leave at about 1400 and made our way back to the nearby Subway station, and to the Hotel. Well, I am no connoisseur of theme parks, but I have been persuaded to visit a few. I can say that the Shanghai Disney is really not up to much. There seems to be so little there, apart from the usual ersatz buildings and the odd ride. There is nowhere to sit and rest, especially not anywhere with shade, and it is far from being a fun and happy place, with so many people running around like mad to beat the lines. But, I think being a theme park goer requires a good amount of youth and energy, and physical stamina, as well as being happy to stand around in lines for half the day. If you have all those then it really is the ‘happiest place on earth’ …."

966,5.0,May 2017,"Singapore, Singapore, ",Not to be missed when visiting Shanghai!,"Will review Disneyland Shanghai in a categorised format. ~Ticket Price ~Bought two-day tickets at ¥670 each (one-day pass at ¥370) for 8 & 9 May 2017.~Queue & Fast Pass~Usually when the board or wait time app says 120 mins, you will reach your ""carriage"" at about 100-110mins. If the park opens at 8am and you manage to enter by 8.15am, head for Adventure Land's Fast Pass queue which is near Roaring Rapids. You cannot get your family members nor friends to help you to get a fast pass, you must be present and the staff will scan your admission ticket to give you a fast pass. One fast pass per queue and per consumption. You can't get a 2nd fast pass without having used your 1st pass. We chose fast pass for Soaring and did physical queuing for Roaring Rapids (RR). We were extremely early, thus we were ""in"" for RR within 10 mins. ~Hotel~Stayed at Novotel Shanghai Clover Hotel which has a metro station 5-min walk away (Kangxin Highway Metro station 康新大公路) that is just one station away from Disneyland metro station (Line 11). Hotel provides complimentary daily feeder bus to the park (7-10am, one bus per half hour, thereafter one bus per hour). Book your seats with the reception the day before. Hotel bus driver alighted us near the escalators leading to a very wide bridge opening up to the foyer before security checks. Hotel also provides complimentary bus from the park back to hotel (bus waits at carpark Donald Duck Row 8-9, the last one leaving the park at 9.15pm, the one just before 9.15pm is 8.45pm. Hotel is about 5-8 min drive away from the park. ~Opening Hours and Queues~On 8 & 9 May 2017, Disneyland was opened from 8am-8pm. We took the very first hotel bus at 7am. It took us a good 10 mins to walk from where the hotel bus dropped us till the queue for security checks (安检）. At 7.20am, there were queues. After security checks, it was queue to get our tickets as Hotel helped us to book online. If tickets booked online, queue before ""取票、检票‘’。On 8 May, these queues were on the right, queue No. 13 onwards. Only the person whose passport is used to book the tickets online needs to bring along his passport. ~Our Strategy & Rides/Sites~We rushed to Adventure Land, thinking of getting fast pass for both Soaring Over the Horizon (翱翔•飞越地平线）and Roaring Rapids (RR) （雷鸣山漂流）(Adventure Isle), however, we could only choose one and we chose Soaring. We were already very early, we were only being held up in the exchange for tickets and yet 8.55-9.55am fast pass vanished in a blink, we could only get 9.55-10.55am fast pass, wow! At about 8.15-8.30am or so, we only needed to queue 10 mins for Roaring Rapids (RR). RR was relatively fun and we got ourselves wet. Poncho is a must! Soaring is a 4D show(with smell, the smell of grass was extremely realistic). We shan't say more so that we won't spoil the surprise they have for you. We tried Challenge Trails under Camp Discovery (古迹探索营～绳索挑战道）(Adventure Isle) not bad! You can choose one of the three rope course expeditions.Tarzan-Call of the Jungle (人猿泰山～丛林的呼唤） (Adventure Isle) was not often mentioned in the TA reviews. It was a hybrid of Tarzan story, music, dance & chinese acrobatic acts and we found this better than Eye of the Storm (风暴来临）in terms of skills and choreography. Eye of the Storm was nice too but different, more on effects done mechanically (unsure if that could be termed special effects ???) Go for both and see which you prefer. Pirates of the Caribbean (加勒比海盗－沉落宝藏之战） (Treasure Cove) was a ride. Well, I have not much recollection of the ride by now. Eye of the Storm was a Chinese play about Jack Sparrow. My Chinese is not too bad but I still had trouble understanding fully what was going on. I just enjoyed the effects and had to forget about understanding the story. We also noticed that Siren's Revenge (探秘海妖复仇号）(Treasure Cove) was hardly mentioned in the TA reviews. May be the reviewers have been to other Disneyland Parks with similar mock-ups. We found this especially refreshing & fascinating: the bunk beds of the pirates, the ""musical instrument"" made from various pots and pans, the talking portraits, the bell (warning sign for all pirates on board, perhaps...) , pull the rope and fire the canon.... haha, cheap thrills for adults....We were on Jet Packs （喷气背包飞行器）(Tomorrow Land) and we enjoyed it ! We queued for 40 mins for just 3 rounds of flying. Buzz Lightyear (巴斯光年星际营救）may be interesting for kids but not for us. Having said this, we still went twice because there was no queue at all (we were not aware of the parade that was ongoing on our 1st day, thus no queue for Buzz Lightyear, by the time we knew it, we only managed to catch the last two floats) and that we wanted to improve our shooting score. We did not try Tron (Tomorrow Land) as we usually stay away from all roller coasters. Star Wars Launch Bay (Tomorrow Land) （星球大战远征基地）was dull for us. For Star Wars fans, you may still wanna give this a shot as you get to take pictures with Darth Vader.Queued almost an hour for Enchanted Storybook Castle (Fantasyland) (奇幻童话城堡）. It was ok. We went to Marvel Universe (Gardens of Imagination) (漫威英雄总部）too~The Parade~12noon and 3.30pm. Unsure of the whole route but you get to see it if you are around Tron (Tomorrow Land). On 8 May, it rained throughout the day, thus the number of floats was reduced which we found out later. 9 May's parade was spectacular! Reminded us of the one we saw at Anaheim, US. The one in HK was not as impressive as the one in Shanghai.We thought Mulan float was special. It was different from the ones we saw at other Disneyland.~Ignite your Dream Light Show~At 8pm. We watched it twice, once on each night. The 1st night from afar where Walt Disney statue stood and another time right before the Castle. Though from Walt Disney statue location, we could catch the entire show within our hp video screen, nothing can beat being before the Castle and be totally immersed in the show. ~Can outside food be brought into the park?~We read from TA reviews that outside cannot be brought into park, only sandwiches and unopened bottles of water can be brought into the park. Thus, we only brought along water and pre-packed cakes by Master Kang （康师傅）etc bought at a convenience store at Pudong Airport and were allowed to be brought in. Then, on our 2nd day, we saw a tourist bringing a huge bag of snacks and her bag passed through security checks, and was not confiscated. Huh? You mean Disneyland has relaxed its rules or that the security was more lenient because it was a weekday? ~Restaurants/Eateries~ High end : Dine at Royal Banquet Hall (皇家宴会厅）and spend extra money on good spot to view the Ignite your dream light show. About ¥1000/2pax and more. Easier on pockets: There are restaurants within the park (eatery near Tron, Tomorrow Land, self-service food court at ¥70-80 per set and more). Eateries in Disneytown: Food Republic (self-service food court at ¥40-55 per dish), Toastbox, BreadTalk (selling bread/buns), XinWang (about ¥50-100 per dish and more). Food Republic is on the 2nd storey. When you see XinWang, take the escalator up to 2nd storey and you will not miss the Food Republic sign. ~Water~Water coolers are found just outside each toilet. You can refill your water bottles.~Cleanliness~Extremely clean! We saw staff clearing rubbish almost instantly. One janitor per toilet.~Toilets~Squat toilet cubicles near entrance of toilet & pedestal toilet cubicles and handicap toilet right at the end. Please excuse the mainland Chinese, they are in the midst of changing the way they do things and this needs time, most of their kids are still using the toilet cubicles without closing the doors. I heard one parent (at least) reminded her daughter to close the door.There are family toilet and baby nappy change area in every toilet.~Smoking~We caught a glimpse of smoking ban in public area in Shanghai wef March 2017 on TV but we can't confirm. We only saw people smoking at designated areas at the park.~Park Visitors~Although we did not encounter serious queue-cutting like some fellow TA contributors did, there were still mild pushing and occasional queue-cutting when we were not paying attention. Vast improvement from 2010 World Expo's (held in Shanghai) queuing experience. 80% of the park visitors were locals. They belong to the average to above average household income earners, thus they are generally more educated and well-mannered. For example, parents asked for permission for their kids to stand before us so that they can get a better view. We even saw a grandma using tissue paper to pick up some fruit skin on the ground while we were seated on the ground waiting for the parade to start. Then, I also heard a dad asking his daughter to look for the nearest dustbin to throw away rubbish. Queue-cutting was more serious at Pudong Domestic Airport than at Disneyland. A single queue line at the airport became three. I had to ask the guy queuing in front of me if he was related to the queue-cutter, then the queue-cutter came out with some lame excuse and decided not to cut me but still cut the one standing behind me.~Conclusion~To sum up, our 8 and 9 May Disneyland visit was an enjoyable one. Ignite your Dream Light show was the show we like best, Siren's Revenge was the mock-up we loved most and Adventure Isle/Treasure Cove was the area we enjoyed ourselves most. "
967,5.0,Apr 2017,New Zealand ,Great Disney Park!,"We spent one day here on our trip to Shanghai. As a big Disney fan, I was very much looking forward to it, and I was not disappointed. As many discuss Tron is amazing. We went on a Wednesday and it was not busy day, so it was great. Fireworks were amazing, as was the entire park in general. "
968,4.0,May 2017,N/A,Transforming Shanghai with the Disney Magic!,"I must admit that even after reading good impressions of Shanghai Disney, I was still hesitant about how it would turn out.  As an American born Chinese with little fluency in Mandarin, I kept my expectations low after knowing the bad behavior of Chinese people and language barrier.  I'll try to keep my ranting short but I do apologize in advance for my people's behavior.  After a two nite stay at Shanghai Disneyland Hotel and 2 day pass I was surprised that Shanghai Disney captured the essence of the original Disneyland.  Adults and kids will love it. Few key highlights and things to keep in mind.1- Pirates of the Caribbean ride was amazing.  We loved the story, lights, ships, and good use of digital displays which made good use of the expansive screens2- Wonderful light performance at the end of the night, though I still feel World of Color is my favorite.3- Definitely looks like a new Disneyland and transported to China.  Kept and maintained well and Tokyo clean (pretty clean considering the number of people)4- Old grandmas are the worst.  They will push and shove to no end to get that extra one step ahead of you in line (did you really get that far?)  They will also use their grandchild as a human shield to get a better spot in line (I'm ok to let kids to up front to see but not an old grandma with her hand on my back) 5- Don't let the line cutters, hawkers selling rain ponchos and knock off Disneyware, or pushers and shovers ruin your experience.  My wife and I have learned to blockout individuals trying to cut (think basketball defense!) when biding your time in line.  6- Realize many people have NEVER EVER been to a Disneyland and hence do not know how to conduct themselves.  My wife translated one couple behind us trying to edge closer to get ahead of us during a ride.  Apparently they did not know the queue was actually for a ride and was trying to figure out if the queue was for a ""walking tour."" 7- Breathe.  The air is much cleaner than downtown Shanghai.8 - Language barrier didn't detract from my experience since I already have background on all the movies. Our overall experience was truly magical and while behavior of some folks detract momentarily from the fun it did not stop us from reliving the excitement we've come to expect form Disney."
969,4.0,Apr 2017,Apple Valley ,Huge,"They offer free fast passes, so register your ticket as soon as you arrive in order to get on the best rides, otherwise you will spend a lot of time waiting in line.  The park was very clean and most workers spoke English and were helpful.  The Tron ride (not at other Disneys) was invigorating, but be sure to have a Chinese coin to rent a locker, as NO purses or backpacks were allowed.  The park is cheaper than its California counterpart, and it was enjoyable walking the grounds and people watching."
970,4.0,May 2017,"Nara, Japan ",Had a GREAT time!!!,"1. Getting to the park - Disneyland itself is pretty far from everything - surrounding hotels, public transportation, etc. Make sure you have your walking shoes on.2. Hawkers - There are lots of people trying to sell you stuff on your hike to the park. Snacks, tickets, rain ponchos, etc. Buy at your own risk.3. Tickets - You can buy tickets online ahead of time and just show the confirmation at the entrance, or you can get your tickets on the day that you go.4. The Poke & Prod - Prepare to have your bags checked and be ready to go through a metal detector.5. Getting in - After the Poke and Prod, you stand in line to actually get into the park. More hawkers stand in line trying to sell you stuff.6. You're In! - Even after entering the park, there are hawkers at the entrance and even jotted throughout the park. Again, but at your own risk.7. My favorites: A) Tron - If you love roller coasters, then this is the one for you. High speeds and cool effects. I am a big boy so I was not able to ride the light cycle part, but every third train has ""regular"" seats at the very back for handicapped passengers and big people like myself. B) Soarin Over the Horizon - The same ride as at California Adventure, but with a different move. FANTASTIC! C) Pirates of the Caribbean - Huge screens, sideways moving boats, and Jack Sparrow. What more do you need?!8. Overall Impressions - Although the park is smaller to other Disneylands, it was the perfect size for a 1-day visit. We went on a day that had some rain, so it was pretty empty (and it was a weekday). For the most part, it is wheelchair accessible, but there are a couple places, like the Marvel exhibit, that did not seem to have an elevator to gt down to the main floor, and some of the areas can get exhaustive going up and down slopes."
971,5.0,May 2017,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ",Disneyland shanghai on a good day,"I was expecting the worst after reading all the negative reviews on tripadvisor- the massive crowd, the occasional pushing and shoving, the bad service, and etc. NONE of that happened. I visited Disneyland on May 4, after the May 1 holiday. And the morning rain helped a little. Crowds were visibly lesser. Getting into the park was a breeze. The security officers also seemed to be in a Vetter mood since there were less people.  The best part was there was no need to wait for tron at all. I downloaded the Disneyland app, which not only shows you the direction to all the rides / shows but also the wait time. The longest wait I experienced was only 20 minutes roaring rapids. The laser lights cum fireworks works show was spectacular. Having been to the one in LA as well, this certainly doesn't disappoint. I also got a 20% off for all the merchandise I purchased. Just follow Disneyland by scanning the barcode with your wechat and present the coupon to the cashier. We immediately left the park after the fireworks so that we'd have seats in the train. Be sure to purchase your return ticket upon arrival so that you won't have to line up for it later. Don't forget China is a country with 1.3 billion people after all. "
972,1.0,May 2017,"Brisbane, Australia ",I really want to give zero score if it is allowed ,"This is a crazy place where you find yourself being surrounded by 1 million people around, anytime! anywhere! The craziness started this morning from 10am when staff forced tourists to open bags and let them search through inside your bag. I saw food like bread and water being taken away by rude staff with no smile but awkwardness on their faces. Express pass is free of charge which is kinda of nice but extremely wired! because what is the point of spending 2 hours queuing for an express pass while actual waiting time is almost the same?! Also plz be reminded express pass is not for the whole park. It is just for one ride!!!!!Food is ok though.... I just couldn't get the terrible scene of a decade long waiting and millions of people out of my mind (half kids fall in sleep while waiting and they have to be carried by their parents). This is going to be my nightmare and I feel so sorry that Shanghai, my hometown, possibly holds the most awkward Disneyland in the entire universe. Shame!"

974,5.0,Dec 2016,"Melbourne, Australia ",Amazing,"Been there twice, once with family and this time with my best friend. Since I already had experience and it wasn't very busy, (although it was boxing day when I visited it), We went on every single ride, some even twice, managed my time well and got every fast pass that was available. It was a wonderful experience since we did not line up for the rides at all, the fireworks at the end was also fantastic. Just one negative thing: the food was expensive and not tasty. "
975,4.0,Apr 2017,"Beijing, China ",A nice place for all ages,"The Shanghai Disneyland is new and clean, with friendly staff everywhere. For visitors with little babies, renting a babystroller seems to be a very wise idea! Not just save your energy, babies also feel comfortabble in the smarly-designed stroller. It's a huge park and deserves a whole day visit, don't miss the parade. If you are not in a hurry to run back at night, firework display at Shanghai Disney is really stunning. In a word, worth your visit."
976,3.0,Apr 2017,N/A,Few highlights otherwise bland,"Visited on a Saturday during a public holiday so was expecting waiting hell. However access to the park was immediate - no one waiting. We went straight to the fast ticket office and lucky enough to buy the last set. Without fast passes I can see why people get frustrated as most lines were over 2 hours. Which is too long for most attractions. Besides Tron and the Roaring Rapids which are actual rides, the other attractions were more bland. The overuse of video screen takes away some of the anticipated excitement. Like Soaring which in essence is just a 5 minute 3D video traveling the world. The smaller attractions were not worth the wait at all. One that did surprisingly was more fun was Buzz Lightyear.And in summer the place must be like an open air oven as there is little shade and being 28 on the day we visited felt more like mid 30's. Overall thanks to the fastpasses we managed 11 attractions but for a memorable day? No not really. Will we be back? No not really. Nothing wrong with the place it was all just a bit bland."
977,2.0,Apr 2017,"London, UK ",Busy busy busy,"I Visited Shanghai Disneyland in April 2017 during a tour of China. I did as much research as possible before going including reading all the reviews here on TripAdvisor to help prepare myself as best I could, but still I was very naive.My first piece of advise... GET THERE EARLY. I'm talking at least two hours early and that is on a week day, I wouldn't even waste your time on a weekend or Chinese holiday. This is a country of 1.4billion and although they aren't all going to Disney even if a few are it's busy busy busy, trust me.Line 11 on the Shanghai metro will take you straight to Disney resort which is the last stop. I prepared to get there one hour early (big mistake) and the metro was still packed with People with the same plan and Chinese trying to sell you dodgy Disney merchandise.Once you arrive at the Metro stop ""Disney Resort"" you will witness the scenes of your day ahead, which is basically a free-for-all. Everyone from young to old will just push, trample and run to the park. I had to jump over the barrier in the metro station because when I put my ticket in I blinked and a old Chinese woman without a ticket ran through slamming the Barriers closed on me (they are ruthless here).After a five minute walk out of the station you will see your first queue, which is just for the security check. You need to make sure you make yourself wide, hold your hands on the ropes of the queue because if you don't you will find the Chinese sneaking past and pushing in (they don't know how to queue) otherwise you will be in that queue all day.I spent my first hour ( yes that's right, one hour) getting into the park pulling people back and blocking them. The Chinese trick is for one of them to manage to sneak past then the hoards of other family members come along to join the one now at the front who's calling them forward, which you will see all day. You might be chilled out and not be bothered by this but when you are in a queue for a ride for two to three hours and never moving further forward this will eventually make you crack. After a hour you will now be inside the park.  ( along with all the dodgy Chinese men and women that are selling the knockoff merchandise, how do they get past security? Hmmm) IT IS IMPERATIVE that at this stage you make it a priority to collect fast passes from different areas of the park first before doing anything else. I made the mistake of going to ""Tomorrow land"" first to collect fast passes for the Tron ride as I thought it would be the busiest, but it's not.(Fast passes allocate you a one hour time slot in the day for you to come back to a ride of your selection in the particular area you collected it from. Not all areas or rides are available for a fast pass).MY ADVICE, head straight to ""Adventure island"" first to collect a fast pass for rides in that area ""Roaring Rapids"" and ""Soaring over the horizon"" as it is without doubt the most popular area with the Chinese. I collected my fast passes from ""Tomorrow Land"" first and made my way to ""Adventure island"" to collect fast passes for that area and the queue for them was just ginormous, and within a minute of being in that area the fast passes for the whole day were already gone. That was less than one hour of the park being open, and without a fast pass for this area the queues for the rides were already three hours long. We decided not to waste six hours of our day on these two rides and made our way back to tomorrow land to go on the Tron and Buzzlight year ride which we used our fast passes for and queued for fifteen minutes as for some reason that area was very quite early on.I read nothing but positive reviews about the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" ride on trip advisor so we decided to quickly head there why it was still early. This queue was about one hour forty-five minutes, but would be shorter if the staff in Disney would stop the Chinese queue jumping. Many tried as usual to pass me during that time and when they had no luck just skip under the rope behind into the queue further along in front of you anyway, but when you don't speak their language your powerless to stop them. Also you will notice that the Chinese that don't queue jump don't understand about personal space so you will spend the whole time in the queue with someone literally riding on your back. Putting up with the queue is well worth it here as this ride is fantastic and well worth the wait.In total I think we manage to get on four rides during our day, but for me there is more to do and see at Disney than just the rides. I have visited every Disney park in the world apart from Tokyo and unfortunately this park ranks the lowest, it's unfortunately lacking that Disney feel. In truth I feel it's a lot to do with where it is, pushing and shoving is Day to day life in china, along with not queuing, spitting everywhere, and not smiling (you would NEVER see that in another Disney park). Also I read about people urinating on the castle and thought it was probably nonsense, but unfortunately we witnessed a few people doing it when we walked around the back. Toilets were literally five seconds away so I don't understand why they would do that, it's another thing in the park Disney seriously need to stop.I know this review sounds really negative but I've just tried to be honest with the whole experience and hopefully help with some tips for anyone that is planing on visiting.Honestly just get there really early, collect the fast passes from where I advised straight away and try and not let the pushing and shoving bother you, it's not personal it's just their way of life.Overall the positives are: •The grounds are still nice to walk around and see the sites,shops and biggest castle•Good parades and shows•Rides like Tron and pirates of the Caribbean are really impressive."
978,4.0,May 2017,"Collaroy Beach, Australia ","Same Disneyland, different country ","Kids will love it as they do at any Disneyland,  Some interesting sights to see as the locals tend to dress like characters...not sure that is there intention, but entertaining nonetheless.  Not really expensive, so good for a family day out.  About a 40 minute cab ride from the city. "
979,3.0,May 2017,"Laramie, Wyoming, United States ",Loved The Attractions Not Other Stuff,"Attractions at Shanghai Disneyland are nice designed with details. The castle, Pirates of the Caribbean and Soaring are just more than amazing. The park is spacious with no Disney train going around it (pity!). The merchandise and food are cheaper with offers and discounts from time to time compared to other Disney parks.However, single rider line is operated in a weird way. I guess first thing first sometimes a lot of Chinese visitors don't really know what ""single rider"" means so groups just stand in single rider line, and the Cast Members don't stop them. Then for Pirates of the Caribbean, even there's no single rider waiting after the merging point, the cast member will still let you wait for a while like 10-15 min. For Roaring Rapids, ridiculously the single rider line is never open, so I had to wait for one hour and seeing single empty seats on the boat when waiting.The service at Shanghai Disneyland is extremely unstable too. Some cast members, usually indoor ones are pretty good and informative. Some cast members working outdoors especially the ones that are assigned to look after the Disneyland passport kiosk are usually facial expressionless when you ask them a questions, or don't even bother to say a word to you by just pointing fingers when being asked for directions. Moreover, the CMs at Shanghai Disneyland have the guts to give you wrong information or respond ""I don't know"". Most of them don't understand English well. Make sure you download the Shanghai Disneyland app so you know the answers beforehand. "
980,4.0,Apr 2017,"Dawlish, UK ","Usual Disney magic, but long wait times ","Very new and clean park. All the usual Disney magic and amenities that you get at all the parks. The ""big ride"" to people ratio isn't quite right and so the queue times can be massive. You can use the fast pass system but there are limited amounts of tickets at the entry to each world and you are limited to obtaining one pass every 45 mins or so, so you can't run round the park first thing collecting fast passes! Plan your day and do your ""can't miss"" rides/areas first. The usual food and souvenir options are available. Easy access via the metro.  The security and ticket area also have really large queues so get there early! "

We love the Tron. Although its a long line its worth the wait. Soaring over the horizon was fantastic. And be careful to ride in the seven dwarfs although its for a kids but maybe not for the small ones. My son love the parade and the fireworks he was so amazed. We went there total of 10 person 4 person don't have the fast pass so some of the rides we wasn't able to try because of the long lines. Next time we may go there early so we can try more rides. We arrived around 10 Wednesday to be exact but there's a lot of people already next time we will go there much more early.
982,5.0,Apr 2017,"Colchester, UK ",Disney but with a twist,"After a long metro journey we arrived at Shanghai Disneyland really not sure what to expect despite being a veteran of the Florida site, albeit about a decade ago!  Following a long walk from the station there was the security check which took some time because of the amount of food some of the visitors were bringing into the park.  Once through the ticket area we made straight for the fast pass station to get a timed ticket for Soaring.  Sadly by the time we got to the front of the line that particular fast pass ticket had closed.  There is a limit to the number of Fast Passes you can have at any one time and also when you can apply for them.  Make getting your Fast Passes your number 1 priority!  Went on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride which has been fully updated from the creaking version we remembered in Florida.  It took a while to get used to the projection of Jack Sparrow speaking Chinese!  There is a surprise in the ride which I will not spoil.  Peter Pan and Buzz Lightyear rides were little different from American versions although for new riders that instructions for the latter were in Chinese.   We queued for Soaring: a 90 minute wait but it was well worth it!The numerous food carts you would expect are dotted around, popcorn, pretzels (with a weird dipping sauce), churros and turkey legs.There is a souvenir and clothing shop within the park but there is a much larger store outside in Disney Town"

984,4.0,Apr 2017,"Wellington, New Zealand ",Waiting time so long,"Overall, my 8 year old daughter and I had a great day here but the waiting time for rides is ridiculous. And the fastpass and premium ticket options were not well explained so it was annoying to find out later we could have saved some of the pain if we'd known how.All in all it took over an hour by taxi to get there and back, and we waited in queues for over five hours. That time was made bearable by people watching, being in shade most of the time and being able to buy snacks and icecreams whilst trapped. Our longest wait for Souring over the Horizon was more than 2 hours (said 90 mins when we got there but there was some delay for 30 mins.) We met a local English speaking family and they were well prepared with snacks and bubble machine so our daughters played together and it turned into a lovely time, and the ride was pretty spectacular.Another downer was not being able to go on Camp Discovery climbing course because we had sandals on - it was not mentioned anywhere you need closed shoes because no one in Shanghai wears sandals. Who knew?It is a cool park - most rides are awesome, there are loads of shows (in Chinese but you can work out what's what) and characters about, with a maze/ gardens around the castle and lots of restaurants. But it's busy so my advice is - prebook ticket online for a weekday, get there 9.30am  for 10am opening and plan to be there until 8.30pm to see it all.  Bring your patience, snacks, passport (to validate ticket) and closed shoes. Race around to all the Fastpass stations to get tickets as soon as you are in, then work your day around the times you get (or shell out for premium passes.)Or just be prepared to wait and enjoy it as a Shanghai experience.

985,4.0,Apr 2017,"Richland, WA ",Unique Disney Park,"Having been to all the Disney parks in the world, Shanghai ranks somewhere in the middle. It is boosted by the unique attractions, many of which you cannot find at any other Disney park. As many have mentioned, Pirates and Tron are the stars of this new park. Pirates is an attraction that mixes screens and traditional set pieces with a unique ride system. Tron is a super cool launched coaster that combines awesome lighting and light techno. While they are the two best, it seems Soarin' and Roaring Rapids get higher waits. Soarin' is exactly the same as its American counterparts. So I would not waste your time there if you have been or plan on going to one of the American ones. Raging Rapids is a fun raft ride, which I would suggest getting a Fastpass early for. Tron and Pirates have single rider lines, which can help reduce the wait there. Other than that, Challenge Trails, Buzz Lightyear, and (especially) Peter Pan are rides that deserve a look. Buzz and Pan are much better than their sister attractions around the world. If you're pressed for time, I would skip Pooh, Jetpacks, and Seven Dwarfs. Yes, crowds are a concern. Just make sure you get there at park opening and have a plan. People can be rude, but if you're already in China, you should know this."

987,5.0,Apr 2017,"Bunbury, Australia, ",First timers,"This is our first time to any Disneyland. We read many reviews on here which helped us.We had read that you get fast passes from guest services booths, but all we found was a person standing there that just gives information. So instead of trying to find fast passes we just lined up. Here are some wait times for us:Tron- in morning 45 min, after 7pm 6 minutes.Pirates of Caribbean 20 min in morning.Seven dwarfs mine train. 1st time in morning 1hr, 2nd time after lunch 30 min.Peter Pan flight 40 min just before lunch. With Tron when you get in you can put your phone or glasses in the tiny compartment they have in each bike. Or you can pay 1rmb for locker with a key . When you get your stuff out you get your coin back. When they do a countdown just before you take off look forward and smile because this is where your photo gets taken. It doesn't matter where you sit your photo has you and person next to you only. As you walk out you will see your photo on screen. Someone should be standing there and you get photopass card that scans your photo on it and anytime during the day or night you can pay 99rmb for a photo . Definitely bring warm clothing as at night it was so cold. You can bring in sealed bottles of water and they have refill stations throughout park. "
988,3.0,Apr 2017,"Flint, MI ",Second Tier Disney,"While visiting China for the first time, we decided to make a family trip to Disney as my cousin's girlfriend works there and to simply have a family-day.I did not expect to see things at the level of the USA ones, but I also expected a bit more out of it. It was probably by design, but the attractions were all extremely distant from one another and that was the biggest complaint. That along with there being no place to hide from the sun nor rain. Food was extremely over-priced but that is to be expected from a place like this.Other than that, there wasn't anything super-special about it besides having the atmosphere of children being happy and families spending time with one another being out and about.I will admit though that the Pirates ride was pretty nifty. They didn't have too much to work with, but used screens and the water to make it an experience. Try to hit that before the crowds though.While it was no USA one, I would recommend going and doing something different from the typical Chinese activities."

When we came out the queues were still 150 mins to get on (similar with most other rides too).I expected the food to be overpriced so that was a given but to give you a heads up water is 10 yuan and a corn dog is 35, ice cream is 50yuan.We went on a mid week (Thursday) and off season so beware that this does not mean that it will be quiet at all.Tbh if you are from the UK and looking​ for a chance to experience Disney for something different then there are plenty of amazing beautiful sites in China other than this horrible tourist trap."
990,2.0,Apr 2017,"Texcoco, Mexico ",Too crowded,"We surprised our kids with a visit to Shanghai Disney at the end of our 10-day tour of China.  We were happy not to have built it up too much (lowering their expectations), as it was not a very good experience.  We had read reviews, so knew that the place would be busy.  As such, we opted to go during the week, in the hopes that it would be better.  But it wasn't.  We got to do three rides for the whole day, as lineups were hours long.  The FastPass system is also not very good, compared to that of Disney World in Florida, where you can book your rides online days in advance.  At Shanghai Disney, you can only get your FastPass the day of and you need to do this onsite.  Worse, you can only book your FastPass for a given area of the park, so you end up having to walk to several different FastPass kiosks across the park to book your rides - not exactly efficient.But the worse part of the experience was the PUSHING.  People in lineups are the absolute worse here - they pushed my wife, me and even our children!  So very, very rude - unlike our experience in Florida or anywhere else in the world, really.  On the upside, the Tron ride was REALLY cool!  The kids and parents really liked it.  It's very fast and the sitting position is quite novel (you sit as if you were on a motorcycle).  Two thumbs up for that!"
991,4.0,Mar 2017,"Troy, MI ",US expats,"My husband and I visited Shanghai Disney a few weeks ago on the first warm weather weekend. I had read on Trip Advisor the Tron ride and the interactive Pirates of the Caribbean rides were the best attractions of the park. Trip Advisor reviews were correct. These rides were worth the wait in the long lines. We stayed for the fireworks which go off at the closing of the park in front of the castle. The fireworks were a nice ending to a nice day at the park. My one disappointment was the pushiness, cutting in line and shouting of some park visitors. Beware of the umbrellas that come out on sunny days especially when waiting in the lines for rides. The umbrellas tend to invade everyone's personal space."
992,4.0,Apr 2017,"Sydney, Australia ",A really great day ,"We had such a good first day at Shanghai Disney that we went back 3 days later! It's super clean and modern and so much to do. The best two rides were Pirates of Caribbean and Tron, both fantastic. We took our 2 daughters on PoC twice and they are only 1 and 2. It is just so well done! And Tron is a fantastic roller-coaster!Other notable mentions is adventure land, buzz lightyear, the mine train, Winnie the Pooh and the Alice in Wonderland maze. The Chinese took Disney and gave it their own touch, such as the spinning honey pots instead of teacups. Downsides are the sometimes looooooong queues and pushy locals but it didn't ruin our day. One ride, however, alludes us - Soaring Above the Horizon. Despite going there first thing for a fast pass we still missed out and queues were 2 hours all day and still 1 hour at 7.30pm. We were travelling with two very small children who couldn't go on it so a wait like that for us was impossible. They need to refine their system with getting in - we arrived a bit before 9am and it took an hour and a half to get through security checks, etc. And some of their staff still don't know rules around parent-swap so they need to work that out too. Places like Tokyo are all over this.If you want to meet any characters check the programme because they don't really wander around and often the window to see them is very small. Overall a very enjoyable experience. I'd go back in a heartbeat. "
993,1.0,Mar 2017,West Coast ,Terrible Experience,"I don’t even know where to begin.  OK, I’m not a huge fan of the Disney parks.  They’re fun for a few times and then you realize that there’s more in the world to see than some sanitized version of it.  When you fly halfway across the world to another country and another culture, I think the last thing you should do is to go to a Disney park.  The only building I saw that had a bit of a Chinese influence was the Castle and the garden.  Where are the Chinese architectural influences in the rest of the park?  Even the retail stores, they have a Westernized look.  If you took away the Castle, the garden, and the Chinese signage, the squatty potties, and the Chinese staff, you’d think you were in one of the US parks on a day with a lot of Chinese tourists.  It’s pretty funny, though, that some other reviewers rate the park downward because things aren’t all in English.  Instead of widening their viewpoints and understanding that this is how a foreign tourist to the US parks feels when he or she visits, some people feel entitled that an amusement park in China has to have all the staff speak fluent English.  I was looking forward to a park that had more of a Chinese character or accent to it.  I don't think there's even really a Chinese-themed attraction or ride which is pretty bizarre, in my opinion.  Where's the Mulan-themed ride or attraction?  Shouldn’t there be the equivalent of California Adventureland?  And you had to look pretty hard to find a nice T-shirt that says “Disneyland Shanghai” on it.  I thought this park at the time of our visit was a disappointment.  The only truly interesting ride was the Tron ride.  That was fun and that was different.  The Pirates of the Caribbean.. yes it’s updated and fun but it’s not that different from the other Pirates rides.  Soaring, was .. OK.  The Roaring Rapids ride wasn’t that exciting.  You certainly did not get very wet since there wasn’t a very large drop at the end of the ride.  The Seven Dwarves Mine Train was basically a version of Big Thunder Mountain.  The Buzz Lightyear ride was pretty similar to the other ones elsewhere.  That was about all of the big rides/attractions.  The strangest part of the visit to Disneyland was that when we were lining up for the Roaring Rapid ride, we saw a lot of people buying rain parkas to protect themselves from getting wet.  They weren’t buying the official Disney parkas, which had the consistency of shower curtain fabric and a Disney logo in the back.  No, they were buying cheap parkas that had the consistency of a trash bag.  The funniest thing is that these didn’t appear to be official Disney licensed items.  Now if someone were selling unofficial items in Orlando or Anaheim, I’m sure his or her items would get confiscated and they’d be prosecuted to the fullest extent by the Mouse.  But we also saw people selling small Mickey flashlights that didn’t also seem to be official merchandise.  I don’t have a problem with people being entrepreneurial and making some money.  But if you decided to selling your own Disney merchandise and carry the merchandise in your backpack, you’d be stopped at security when they searched your bag.  So how did they get their merchandise through to sell to the tourists trapped in the lines???I let my guard down.  The trip to Disneyland was the last activity we were doing in China.  After all, it *is* Disneyland, right?  So things are nice and safe right?  Our experiences in Orlando and Anaheim would reinforce that notion.  But I got my wallet stolen in Disneyland Shanghai.  I’m not sure where exactly, probably one of the packed lines, but it definitely went missing from my pants pocket.  My thought was if enterprising entrepreneurs can get into Disneyland and sell their items, what other type of enterprising people can also get in and target tourists?"

995,3.0,Apr 2017,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ",It was GOOD... and then it just wasn't,"The BEST Pirates of the Caribbean ride I've ever ridden (and I've done both Disneyland Anaheim and Tokyo Disneyland). TRON - BEST dark roller coaster ever! I sat twice in the wheel-chair rider (rear of the coaster bikes) and have absolutely no regret at all. The rides at Fantasyland is no different that those in other Disney theme parks. Which was really disappointing.  I went on a Wednesday and Thursday but was surprised that the Disney characters (princesses, Mickey & co, Villains, etc) don't walk around much in the park to mingle with the park visitors. In fact I only saw Pluto and that was it. I guess this being China, the Disney characters might get bombarded by the ever annoying mainland locals. The Disney merchandise was a total let down. I've seen better merchandise, especially magnets in other parks. The merchandise here seems to be concentrated 100% on the toddler and kids demographic. (yes, D-Land is for kids, but the adult market has it's potential). Perhaps the two facilities that deserves applause and special mention are the toilets and drinking water fountains. Ever impeccably clean and located in so many places, we totally kept hydrated as much as we wanted, knowing the nearest loo was just around the corner.   Be warn : mainland guests are not shy to cut queues, just because their friends are 25 steps in front of the line. One day is good enough to cover all basic attractions. I bought a two-day ticket, and was bored by the second afternoon."

The theme park is really beyond my expectation given that I read some of the quite negative articles before. The decoration and rides are so beautiful and fun. Love their ease of accesibility
997,5.0,Apr 2017,"Adelaide, Australia ",Best Disney Castle and fantastic Treasure Cove area,"Hard to describe how big and impressive the Castle is and how wonderful the park is. In many ways, this Disneyland is better than Anaheim, Disney World and Paris.  The Pirates of the Caribbean area is huge and themed so well. Of course the ride is sensational but you could easily spend more than 3 hours in the Treasure Cove area. You must eat at Barbossa's Bounty and have the Pirate's Platter. Although similar to Anaheim, where you eat inside the ride, there are separate Pirate's taverns to eat in and each are individually themed. Kids loved the free ice creams and so many interactive attractions and clean toilets. Pirates of Caribbean ride was easy to access with short queues especially when the fireworks were on and worth walking straight there when park first opens. Tron ride was a family favourite and the seats near the southwestern corner of Gardens of Imagination were excellent for fireworks that were still available an hour before the performance.  The Golden Fairytle Fanfare at the base of the castle is far superior to the parade and worth getting good seat 45min before performance."

Not too bad as it is always something looking around. So many people in the morning, the fast pass isn't easy to get. I think the best option is to get a sessional tickets and go there in the afternoon after 3pm for a few days."

1001,5.0,Apr 2017,"Mackay, Australia ",Making dreams come true ,"This really is the happiest place on earth. Went with my young family and one other family and had a ball (even with experiencing the few negatives which I'll outline later)!The newest of Disney's parks is clean, bright and very embracing but just be prepared that basically all the shows are in Mandarin/Chinese (obviously)! You have to be fully aware that the entrance lines are massively long, even at 8.30am (well it is a country of 1.3b people)! It will take about 1-1.5 hours to get through the initial security check point where your bags are searched, but once through that, it's only about 5-10mins to get through the adjacent admission gate, THEN YOUR'E IN! My tip (and what I did) is pick the ride you truly and desperately want to definitely ride, and go straight there first up! I ran to the TRON ride and 'WOW', loved it. Took me 50mins to get on (as everyone else has the same idea) BUT when I got off the ride the advisory sign listed the wait time as 140mins!!! Now, this will cost a little bit more but I strongly suggest having lunch at the Castle Banquet Hall. You can pre-book or just show up on the day. I have two young children under 13 years of age, and they just LOVED IT! You get absolutely fantastic restaurant quality yummy food, unlimited drinks, superb standard service and Disney characters constantly attending your individual table and giving you personalised attention for unlimited photos (we got Mickey, Minnie, Donald and Daisy). And honestly, with the prices you get charged for the park's fast food, the banquet hall is not that much more expensive and hugely a much better experience (in comfortable air conditioning). Now the regrettable negatives, and this is only so you can be prepared and watch out for them. - as outlined, long long line-ups. Just try and prepare for this as it's unavoidable, - illegal 'hawkers' selling crap, 'knock-off' Disney merchandise both inside and outside the park (the bastards even get on your tour bus at the end of the day and try and push their wares),- a lack of shade related areas on hot days so drink heaps of water (it's so cheap to buy in the park -approx AUS $1.90/ CHN ¥10 a bottle),- like any theme park, some rides are closed for renovations at short notice, so do some research before going to avoid disappointment (to small or big kids), - some (a lot) locals are quite vulgar compared to western attitudes and expectations, and spit everywhere/anywhere, - my wife was devastated - this is our 3rd DL theme park and it doesn't have Disney's signature ride ""It's a Small World"" (ha ha ha). Anyway, my opinion, arrive early and leave late. Get as much in as you can and you'll have so much fun. "
1002,3.0,Apr 2017,"San Jose, CA ","There were highlights, but know that it isn't quite as magical","Tron and Pirates of the Caribbean are the top must visit rides. Check Google for days of the week for peaks - we visited on Monday and Tuesday. It was raining on both days, enough rain that we needed ponchos (easily available for purchase at the Disneyland Resort or stores inside Disneyland). But less crowd on Monday (not sure if it was the rain). Highly recommend just trying the snacks while inside the park, and making the trek to Disneytown for meals. We had the Mickey Mouse pizzas inside the park, and it was cute but not good. We tried their version of turkey legs, and while the locals around us all were devouring theirs, I was turned off by the smell. We shared 3 legs amongst 6 and still had left overs. We also tried the cafe in Tomorrowland, the kid's meal with chicken was over cooked and dry, the veggies were inedible. The fries were the only decent item. If you stay at the Disneyland Resort, grab breakfast at the Ballet Cafe before heading over the Disneyland. You'll have much better tasting food there. Even room service food was good! "
1003,2.0,Apr 2017,"Playa del Carmen, Mexico",great rides! awful experience!. no disney vibe!,"The rides are great . no question about that. The shows are ok and in mandarin so don't expect any show in english. Most of the staff knows some english. all the staff is very polite and profesional. but here comes the list of bad things that we experienced 1 - we were warned about big lines so we arrived at 7AM from the toy story hotel just to find a huge crowd of people making line to pass security. The crowd was full of creepy people who make line for money. They arrive very early , take the first places. Then they go out of the line and off you for money to be squeezed in to the first places. people called out the line skippers to the security and no one does anything . no one was sent to the back of the line and one one punished in any way. It seems like the organizers allowing all this to happen because they have a cut from all the illegal activities in the park. 2 -  The lines are very long . sometimes up to 120 minutes for some rides which only last about 90 seconds . People skip lines like crazy. you have to pay good attention to who is behind you . As soon as you look the other way, they will try to skip. usually they try to skip in the turns of the queue.   Old ladies tell little kids to run forward though the line, then they will tell you like they going after the kid but they will not come back to their original spot. its very shameful. old ladies do that a lot.   Only once I saw the security send the skippers to the back of the line out more than one dozen incidents of skipping. 3- illegal merchandise is sold inside and outside the park in large quantities. The organizers just allow this to happen because in my opinion they get a cut from this4-  All fast passes are finished by 11am. the lines for the fast passes are huge. creepy people sell fast passes everywhere  (they remind me of drug dealers in concerts)  and these fast passes work. it looks like they print out about half of the fast passes and give them to these dealers to sell. This is why they are finished very fast. I think the organizers wanted to sell fast passes and cheap merchandise from very beginning legally in the park .but the headquarters of disney do not allow it. So they turned to the illegal dark ways to do this 5- they sell seasonal passes. this in my opinion overcrowds the park with local people from Shanghai.  I met a couple that had such a pass. they come 2-3 times  a week to the park. 6- people smoke and spit everywhere (I expected this in china)7 - people let their kids pee and poop on the grass while inside the queue lines for the rides. They do not want to miss their spot so they just let kids do it right there. I saw boys and grown man peeing inside a bottle just so they do not need to leave the queue . its very shameful8 - this is a good thing. The restaurants are never full . Everyone is making lines for the rides and brings their own food. to summarize this park is not anywhere to the disney standards. it just does not feel like disney.  The headquarters in the states should really consider sanctions or something against such behaviors of the organizers.   it looks like its controlled by a mafia. If you go to single rider lines, you will pass a lot faster, maybe faster than fast pass. Especially in Tron.  My advice is to go very early like 6am. Camp out by the entrance  with drinks and snacks. Also bring snacks of the queue lines. Run to adventure islas as fast as you can after entering. go to the fast pass line and get the fast pass to Roaring Rapids. then run to Soaring over horizon and get in line. Before 10am its less than 20 minutes wait . Then go to roaring rapids. after that you will have to make lines . Pirates of the Caribbean is better before closing. Smaller lines.  Tron is much cooler at night .  Buzz light year always has less than 20 minutes wait. Dumbo lasts only 60 seconds and you have to wait one hour in line. If you want a good spot for the castle show in the end, you have to camp out since 5:30PM. never go on weekends  , Monday and Tuesday. These are the most busy days. on Saturday , each ride has more than 120 minutes wait time"
1004,3.0,Apr 2017,"Newtown, Australia ",Would be great if it wasn't so busy,"We visited Shanghai Disneyland on a Thursday thinking that it wouldn't be as crowded and were disappointed. We arrived just after 9.00am and were in a line for about 1/2 hour for the security check and then another 10-15 mins to get in the gate (would recommend getting there earlier).As we had the Disney app (which is great) we decided to head to Tomorrowland to line up for Tron. We managed to pick up a fast pass for Tron which was to be used within the next 2 hours. We did the Buzz Lightyear Planet Rescue and the lined up for Tron as it had a 70min wait, just enough time to do the ride and do it again with the fast pass. We ended Lining up for Tron for 90 mins and missing the fast pass ( they were kind enough to let us through though). After Tron we had lunch which was ok and then lined up for Hunny Pot spin (which was a reasonable 1/2 wait).All the other rides in the park that we wanted to go on had more than a 2 hour wait (all fast passes ran out very early). We decided on Roaring Rapids - which ended up being around a 2 hour wait; it was a fun ride but not sure it was worth the wait.After this it was late in the afternoon & we had only done 5 rides & were quite tired for standing for so long, we did the Alice in Wonderland Maze and then decided to head back to the hotel.Overall it wasn't a great experience, there were a number of rides that were closed i.e Dumbos and the waiting times were just too much.We have been to Hong Kong Disneyland a couple of times as well as Tokyo and have had an amazing time but Shanghai just wasn't a lot of fun (Tron is a great ride). The children had fun on the rides that they went on but were exhausted by the lines & no one was up for the fireworks. We spent 9 hours at Disneyland with a half hour break for lunch & only did 5 rides, it really isn't worth it!!"

1006,4.0,Apr 2017,N/A,Enjoyable with the right expectations,"Bought the 2day pass to Shanghai Disneyland for a Tue-Wed. We did loads of googling about Shanghai Disneyland beforehand. We went in expecting the place to be crowded and the lines to be long, so we only aimed to do the 3main rides and for the rest of the time we went to the shows, admired the design of the place, window shopped, and tried the food there. First day we arrived at the gates by 8.10am managed to get into Disneyland at 9am on the dot. Went to see Soaring as our first ride, this took ~30min of waiting in line. On our way to Soaring we saw the fastpass line in adventure isle and it was huge! Definitely longer than the actual ride itself. We also did pirates of the Caribbean the first hour of park opening - this took 30min of waiting. After ~10.30am all the lines were over 60min long for the main attractions. We used our second morning to do the Tron ride. Tomorrowland was much less crowded in the morning compared to adventure isle. Tron ride fast passes run out slower and we managed to do our second Tron ride using the fastpass - there was no line for the tomorrow land fastpasses in the morning. In general we felt tomorrowland was less crowded than all the other lands and for that reason we enjoyed it the most. Overall we had a great couple of days. Pros were:- very well maintained place and everything was still looking new- plenty of clean toilets- free drinking fountains everywhere- the restaurants were less crowded than we thought and it's easy to go to disneytown for alternativesCons:- not really any real negative reviews, personally we preferred themes from the Disney renaissance era since we grew up with those movies but the park themes are more in tune with movies from 2000 on wards and Star Wars.. this made the place feel less nostalgic & magical - people use their phones to capture literally anything and everything which sometimes detracted our enjoyment of the rides/attractions since phones/flash lights get in the way.."
1007,4.0,Dec 2016,"Perth, Australia ",Brilliant beginnings for this park,"It was with some trepidation that my husband and I headed to the newest Disney Resort. We'd heard stories and seen footage of some uncouth behaviours that had us wondering how this experience was going to treat us. We stayed onsite at the Disneyland Hotel and our visit gave us three nights and three days of park time. In our opinion, this was perfect, however we did ride some rides more than once daily. We don't speak mandarin, however the staff were fantastic with us and we got by just fine. The rides on offer were great. It's worth a visit for Pirates and Tron alone! There were a range of meet and greets on offer, the shows were spectacular and the castle light show was just magic!The only behaviours we noticed as an annoyance was the rush to get into the park, with guests disregarding signs and running to their first attraction, and people holding places for people in lines.Having been to Paris, Orlando and Anaheim prior to this, I can attest to them bringing the Disney magic, however I will say it's a work in progress. There is clearly demand for more attractions and the works in progress show that Disney have recognised this. The one annoyance we did experience was with the PhotoPass with both setting it up and with using it, which Cast Members were able to resolve easily. That said, I would recommend only using one photo card per photopass if you are there for more than one day. If you can, stay at the Disneyland Hotel, which offers spectacular views to the hotel and while you cannot see the castle show in detail, you can enjoy a fabulous view of the fireworks. My other tip is to be wary of city taxis if you don't speak mandarin. If possible, catch public transport or organise private transfers. Would I return? Absolutely! I fell in love with both Shanghai's City and Disney Resort. "
1008,5.0,Apr 2017,"Hong Kong, China ",Most beautiful Disneyland so far! Absolutely worth visiting!,"I've been to all the Disney Parks in the world and Shanghai Disneyland is by far the grandest, most beautiful version there is so far!  I grew up in L.A., (therefor, went to Anaheim Disney a few times a year, Orlando once every 3-4 years), visited Euro Disney in Paris, Tokyo Disney and Disney Sea multiple times and have lived in Hong Kong for over a decade (Hong Kong Disney once a year!)  I previously told myself that I would wait 5 years for the novelty of Disneyland in Mainland China to wear off on the locals before going myself, but on a last minute Easter long weekend trip, my husband and I booked a trip to Shanghai and playing at Disney Shanghai for one day became our top priority!We went on a Friday, during Easter weekend and true to the other trip advisor reviews we read, we went 40 minutes before the park opened to line up to get through security.  We got to the park at 7:20 am, went through a very strict security and made it to the ticketing entrance by exactly 8:00 am, which is the official opening hour of the park!  Even though it was a Friday, it was not considered to be a peak day and we paid 370 rmb ($53.75 USD) each for a ticket, which is SUPER worth it in my opinion.  The ticket price is the cheapest Disneyland ticket in the world, as most of the Mainland locals can't afford much higher.  Just for reference, here are the ticket prices of the other Disneylands in the world: 1)  Hong Kong - HK $589 ($75.75 USD),  2) Tokyo -  7400Yen ($68 USD),  3) Anaheim $99.50 USD starting,  4)  Orlando Magic Kingdom $99.50 starting.Our expectations were not set very high and as we're from Hong Kong, we know the cultural and social norms of Mainland China.  We studied the Disney Shanghai map quite a bit before going and figured that there was no way we could get through all the rides in a single day even if we got the right amount of fast passes at the right time.  So instead, we bought their Premiere Access Pass (Shanghai Disney is the only Disney Park that offers such a service) which is the equivalent of getting all the fast passes (7 rides total) in a little packet with no time limits for 480 rmb ($70 USD) each.  On Peak days, the Premiere Access Pass cost 600 rmb and yes they still sell out.  Yes, the Premiere Access Pass is almost more than 1.5 times the cost of the original park ticket but if you are ok shelling out almost $100 USD for a normal ticket at the US Disney parks, then this is definitely the option to go for.  To combat scalpers from buying these Premiere Access Pass tickets then selling them off again for profit, we had to take a selfie with the Disney staff who sells the Premiere Access Pass that day and this selfie along with the passes had to be shown to the Fast Pass ticket collector in front of each ride for us to be able to get on.  We assume that the scalpers previously just bought out these Premiere Access Passes to scalp and the real guests who wanted them couldn't get them anymore and so, they implemented the selfie rule.  Even with the Premiere Access Passes, it still took us the entire day from 8 am to after fireworks (8:30 pm) to see almost the entire park.   The only attractions we missed were the Frozen Sing-a-long and the Adventure Trail.  The average wait time that day for the popular rides (Seven Dwarf’s Mine Trains, Soarin, Raging Rapids and Tron) were all at 160 mins.  Most of the other kiddie rides were at 45 – 60 mins.These are our thoughts on the Rides and the Shows:Tron: awesome new form or roller coaster where you’re going headfirst as if you’re riding a motorcycle!  Ride this at night when the colorful lights turn on!Pirates:  The most amazing ride of the entire park.  It uses the most advanced technology in any of the Disney theme parks and the effects left me gaping like a goldfish.  Worth a 2nd ride if you have time.  Seven Dwarf’s Mine Train:  This is a fun roller coaster appropriate for all ages.  Probably not worth a wait longer than 45 minutes though unless you are with children.Raging Rapids:  Similar to any rapids ride in the world.  Winnie the Pooh / Peter Pan:  Similar to the ones in the other Disney parks with newer technology and projections.  Soarin:  Exactly the same as the ones in the US but with different content.  Coming from California, I thought the original was a better “story” as it had more of a cohesive feel to it.  This one features international landmarks but seemed more random.  Buzz Lightyear:  New Technology! Much more accurate than the older versions and you can actually tell where you’re shooting!Jack Sparrow Stunt Spectacular:  My husband speaks fluent mandarin and even he can only understand about 50% of what they’re saying but it still is a fun stunt show.  Also features technology that I have never seen used on a stage before.  Tarzan Acrobatics Show:  This is the one attraction that I think can be skipped in this Park.  If you’ve never seen a Chinese acrobatic show, then it’s still fun to take children to go watch. It floats halfway between a Chinese acrobatics show and a mute musical so it was a little odd. If you’ve seen a proper acrobatic show or musical / play before, this one can’t compare as the artistic direction is not quite there.   The story itself is quite broken due to the need to show off different tricks.  Other things worth seeing:  The Maze of the Queen of Hearts!  It’s a spectacular little garden right under the Main castle and the mosaics around the park!  There are 4 main mosaics inside the castle and they are sooo beautiful!  And specific to Disney Shanghai - there is also a Zodiac wall walk in the gardens where featured mosaics of the different Disney Zodiac animals make for cute photographs as well!Castle:  The Biggest and most beautiful in the world!  Pictures do not do it justice!Parade:  The floats are SO Beautiful!! I think it’s the first time Disney has given Mulan her own float (to celebrate being in Shanghai, China of course…) and was quite a long parade so it was very enjoyable.Fireworks:  Different from what you’d expect.  There are very few actual fireworks because the Shanghai government has restrictions and actually doesn’t allow fireworks in the city to help combat pollution.  Instead, they’ve done a light show 3D-projected onto the Castle.  But like all projections on uneven surfaces, it’s difficult to tell what’s going on.  It wasn’t bad, but I personally prefer the spectacle of fireworks.  Overall, Disney has done a great job in cleaning up the image of Shanghai Disney from its first opening days.  The park staff were very helpful and friendly, everything was very clean (even the toilets!  There’s no line for western toilets btw…), graffiti was no where to be seen and there’s barely any trash on the floor.  The staff try very hard and are very professional even in stressful circumstances.Of course we expected line cutting and shoving as most Mainland Chinese from rural areas have had to fight their entire lives for anything, but it really wasn’t as bad as we expected.  My husband and I just lined up horizontally to take up the entire width of the line and if there’s a little pushing, you can just tell them off and they’ll stop.  The most used excuse is “I’m looking for my kid” or “husband”.  99% of the time, this is a lie.  The lady behind us tried to cut by saying “Her husband is in front”.  We told her to call her husband and tell him to wait up for her instead and sure enough, when we got to the front of the attraction, she completely forgot about her imaginary husband already and rushed onwards with her friend.  Some families also have little kids run under everyone’s arms and they chase the kid with their entire group and cut where the kid stops running.  Best way to avoid this is to not let the kids run through.  That being said, overall, most everyone was very civilized and waited their turn. Every 10 minutes or so, the ride operators play a voice notice in Mandarin reminding people to wait their turn in line and to respect that everyone has a fair wait.  Scalpers will also keep offering you fastpass tickets that they get on their seasonal pass.  These get progressively cheaper throughout the day as they’re about to expire.  A lot of people also rush through the lines selling fake Minnie Ears for 10 rmb each so a lot of people wear these which I guess in a weird way, help contribute to the overall atmosphere?  Most of the locals also don’t know their classic Disney lore so you’ll see a lot of men also wearing Minnie Ears.  They know Frozen and Pirates the most.  Like the other reviewers have said before, a lot of Mainland locals (probably not from Shanghai) bring their own food and thus, the restaurants have PLENTY of seating.  For us who are used to food in Asia, the food in this park is a welcome variety as not everything is Deep Fried.  An interesting snack that we had was “Seafood Churros” which are super thin, fry-like fish fingers covered in Okinawa Sauce and Bonito Flakes (found in front of Pirates).  If you’re adventurous and used to International Cuisine, you should try it! It was fun to eat!This park also features 3 large grassy picnic areas which is a nice addition for larger families.  As for the language barrier, it was no surprise to us that everything was in Mandarin. My mandarin is quite poor (in HK, we speak Cantonese) and I find it completely fair that everything is in Mandarin since the park is in Shanghai.  When we went to EuroDisney, we couldn’t understand the French instructions.  When we went to Tokyo Disney / Disney Sea, we couldn’t understand the Japanese instructions, but that’s to be expected!We had dinner at Wolfgang Puck’s in DisneyTown outside afterwards and it was good.   The food was according to Wolfgang Puck’s usual restaurant standards but they like to serve you all the food at once in varying order.  But I guess that’s just a cultural difference (food is served as soon as it done so it’s as fresh and hot as possible).Overall, Shanghai Disney is really worth going to because 1) the attractions use the latest technology Disney has ever used in any park, 2) some things are particular to Shanghai Disney only and are not at any other Disney park, 3) The cheap ticket price and 4) The park is really just so beautiful done!  We’ll definitely come back to visit!  Rumors are they should be expanding in a few years too!"
1009,5.0,Apr 2017,"Princes Risborough, UK ",Fantastic Day!,"This was our first visit to a Disney park and we had a fantastic day, it really exceeded our expectations.  We went on a public holiday so expected crowds but it really wasn't too bad particularly because the park is so spacious.  The shows and parades were excellent and there was a great atmosphere, no issues with language barrier and all the staff were very friendly.  There are not a lot of big rides so older children may get bored but for families with younger children >10 it's perfect.  Would highly recommend for anyone visiting the Shanghai area."

1011,5.0,Mar 2017,"Macon, GA ",A Must See for Disney Fans!   Disney Fans will be in Heaven!,"WOW!   I was simply blown away by this newest international Disney park.  Yes, I flew 15 hours from America just for this park and it was worth every penny.  Spent four days there soaking up all the magical details.  Disney has built this park to handle crowds perfectly.  Favorite rides included Tron, Pirates of Caribbean, Soarin', and the Exploration Trails.  Even if you have done Soarin' in America, do it here.  The queue is mind blowing with a planetarium style ceiling leading you in.  The ending is from downtown Shanghai.  Spend some time exploring on Mickey Avenue.  So many new, neat touches.  Be sure and check out the Gardens of Imagination, and get your photo with your Disney animal on the Chinese Zodiac.Everything just smells new and looks fresh throughout this park.  The cast members had some trouble with English, but tried hard to help.  Loved being able to hop over to Disney Village for a meal after the fireworks.  Do not miss the afternoon parade and special shows especially Tarzan.  Classic rides like Peter Pan and Buzz Lightyear Blasters are revamped with new advanced touches you are sure to enjoy.  Went on a Monday - Thursday, and crowds were light especially once the sun went down.  Did notice some guests who just bumped there way in front of me when in line, and witnessed some upset Americans at these Chinese guests who seemed to not know proper park protocol.  Regardless, you will enjoy every second of this most magical park."
1012,4.0,Apr 2017,"Hong Kong Island, China ",Impressive technology overall and a fun day even for adults,"Yes there will be the usual China-related annoyances (smokers, ticket scalpers, queue jumpers, spitting, and overall Chinese weirdness) however it didn't really spoil the experience. Pirates of the Caribbean is a must ride! The 3D technology is just amazing.Soaring (if you haven't done it at the other Disneys) is also very worthwhile with all senses being tickledThe Camp Discovery Challenge Trail was surprisingly a challenge with some scary bits (parents with kids can bypass the more treacherous parts, which otherwise were great for playing Indiana Jones)Tarzan show has some really fun acrobatics and served well by Chinese acrobatsTron looked awesome - but we didn't manage to get a fast pass and by the time we got to Tomorrowland we were too late for the last entryThings could be a bit better - we were disappointed there were much less Disney characters wandering the park and signing autographs vs the US parks. Also the queue wait time is stupendously long with some over 90 minutes for what was a rainy weekday!Main tip we can share is get in early and read up on traveller blogs to figure out the best plan for getting the fast passes and plot your way across the park (we traversed too many times back and forth between treasure cove and fantasyland). Also we found standing at Mickey Avenue near the exit directly facing the castle was a great view for the closing fireworks and light show. Also means you can get out quickly before the stampede."
1013,1.0,Apr 2017,"Seattle, WA ",Lines Too Long For Kids,"If you have been to the US Disney parks, this will be a huge disappointment.  Imagine going to the Anaheim park with twice the people and half the rides.  By 11am, all the Fastpasses were gone and by noon, there wasn't a single ride with a wait less than 90 minutes.  We rode 4 rides the entire day.  The food was terrible, too.  But we were able to bring snacks in so I would load up before you arrive.  On a positive note, this version of Pirates of the Caribbean was pretty cool.  They did a good job of concealing the lines so they didn't spill out into the walkways.  The close metro station was great too.  This was supposed to be a fun surprise for our 6-year-old twins and ended up being the most frustrating day of our trip to Shanghai.  Don't waste your time or money here!"

The best one is the Pirate of the Caribbean.  It was closed for maintenance.  The other one is ""Soaring over the Horizon"".  They were not issuing the fastpass and waiting time is over 2 hours.  I did not wait in line.I've been to the one in Anaheim California and Orlando.  They are much better and bigger, but twice as expensive.  I was able to get discount coupons from the Internet, but not in shanghai.  You cannot bring food like dry Romi Noodle into the park. Fruits, sandwich and water is OK.  There are drinking filling stations at most of the restrooms.  Save you bottle.  If you had been to the Disney parks in the US, I would not recommend come here, especially when you can't go to the two top attractions.  You can get the the park via subway #11.  It is at the end of the rout.  You have to get off at least two time to change to another rout 11."
1018,4.0,Apr 2017,Toronto ,"Good experience for our 1st time here but the queues were long for a ""quiet"" day","I read the earlier ""bad"" reviews about behaviour and line cutting and all that stuff and was prepared for it.  I expected rude Chinese and smokers everywhere.  But they were reasonably well-mannered and there were no smokers roaming the park except in the smoking area.  We didn't see experience or see any line cutting on our 1st day but the 2nd day had some people trying to cut in while we were in line.  The staff at this queue had balls.  He had the family go to the end of the line and didn't take any bull from the line cutting family.The park was very clean with an army of staff cleaning constantly.  The rides were incredible (when we could get on them).  My girls met Flynn Rider and Rapunzel at the meet'n'greet and were very happy they took the time to talk to them.   My girls were even more surprised and excited when they saw Flynn and Rapunzel during the afternoon parade.  Flynn saw my girls and quickly tapped Rapunzel to look our way and they both called out the names of my girls.  They remembered!  That made my girls so happy.  That was a special moment for them.I thought the food prices were reasonable although we did go to Disneytown for dinner as we wanted a good sit down experience.Our 2nd day in the park wasn't as good.  It was so busy!  That was a shame.  The lines were crazy that we just gave up and just enjoyed the park atmosphere.Overall it was a very good experience.  I hope that they include early and late entry for guests staying at the resort hotels like they do at Disney World."

1020,3.0,Apr 2017,"Indore, India ",One day Visit to Shanghai Disney World,"After lot of confusion based on reviews at Trip advisor we finally decided to visit Shanghai Disney World today i.e. On April 14th, and may we endorse most criticism mentioned was absolutely correct. Bad things first:1) It's maddening crowd, and it was everywhere... We woke up early morning at 5am (staying at The Bund) so as to reach on scheduled opening time at 8am, but could only end up finding hundreds of visitors already lined up.. They simply oversell the tickets and no policy inplace for crowd management... Each place required a waiting period from 30 to 180 minutes, for a ride time that last few seconds or few minutes at the most!!! It's Too too bad!!!Disney World is actually spoiling their own reputation by doing this. Due to excessive maddening crowd we could only manage to see few attractions...After spending so high, this is the last thing that one would expect!2) It's mostly meant for local public! All shows had narrations and story telling in Chinese language only, indeed after waiting in long lines to enter a show, we were forced to come out in few minutes as couldn't understand their language. Although they do claim to provide narrative assistance, but when we asked from the local assistant, she could only help us to get out from the hall.3) If you are vegetarian, God Save you!!  Restaurant serves only non veg, you better be ready on your own before you enter. Remember not to carry any goods that need to be prepared using hot water etc (like cuppa noodles) as they don't allow the same. You could find some bakery item at the metro station shops which would be allowed to be carried (only life saviour) and help you survive the day.4) Better opt for Fast pass and plan your day before you come here with the mobile app in place, we didn't do it and to top it had language problem to understand their narrations in Chinese, hence were short of time.5) They need to add better shows, I would dare say that other similar parks like Sentosa in Singapore and Imagica at India had better attractions.The Good Things:1) The property is new and very nicely maintained.2) Most of the staff were helpful and could understand English partially to assist us.3) Pirates of the Caribbean was the only show that we liked and would recommend to all. Tron was another good attraction for those who like the high speed action!!4) The parade was good and covered most of the characters, ensure to grab a good place in advance on its track route to get most of it.5) The best of all was light, sound and firework show which is the closing event of the day at 8pm and last for 20min. Ensure to sit as near to the Central Park water body as possible to get the wonderful view of water show. The crowd is maddening at the end of the day and we have to literally fight out to find the space to stand which was very far off the castle to catch the action and it was worth it.Overall a good day spent with only major show spoiler being maddening crowd!! Keep your fingers crossed on your day and go for it if you or your kids are Disney lovers! "
1021,4.0,Mar 2017,"Honolulu, HI ",Shanghai Disneyland,"Got to the park about half an hour before opening so although lots of people in lines to enter, once we go in wan't too bad.  Selected a few rides beforehand so we could head for them at the beginning.  Rode Tron several times because no lines.  Same for the Buzz Lightyear ride which is close by to Tron.  Was disappointed that there weren't as many rides as I thought from all the publicity.  Basically an average of three attractions per area.  Overall ok, but probably will be better in a few more years after they develop more attractions."

1023,3.0,Apr 2017,"Harare, Zimbabwe ",The long waits just ruined the experience!!!,Ok yes we only planned for  1 day which is too little time to do most of the things but still i feel robbed.My nephew couldn't do most of the things or rides because of the long queues. I think management should limit ticket sales to hold the visitor's experience of Disneyland. Its pointless to let people flood in there and fail to experience anything because people are packed like sardines and you have to wait for hours and hours on end just to get onto a ride.I feel so bad for my nephew having come with him all the way from Africa just for that. He was just overwhelmed with the crowds and we missed out on most rides because of the queues. wasted very expensive tickets.
1024,5.0,Apr 2017,N/A,Book your ticket online,"I really really recommend whoever that want to visit here to book the ticket online because the crowd are crazy and so the queue. Not I also not recommending to go here on public holiday and weekend because its like a sea of people inside, and you wont be able to play all of the good games because the waiting times can be like 3 and more hours. The ticket price for weekdays and not public holiday is 370RMB and for weekend and public holiday will be 499RMB (you can check and buy the ticket from Shanghai Disneyland app). And if you buy the ticket online there will be a special queue lane for that so don't worry the queue wont be as long as the normal one. The show and the games are very very spectacular. Because this disneyland is very new so all the technology are the newest one and the show are the most updated one! I recommend you guys to play the Pirates of Caribbean 4D it is very very awesome! I wish i can play that again but the queue too long. For the food there are take away stall and i got to try the Turkey Chicken Leg which cost 70RMB and when i come that time to buy this chicken leg i need to queue for 30mins and 1 person can only buy 2 serving, but it is very worth! Don't forget to watch the parade and other show, my friend told me that Tarzan Show is the best one but i didnt manage to watch it. Oh and this Shanghai Disneyland is soooo big so make sure to wear comfortable shoes and bring a water bottle (you can easily find water fountain, usually in every outside of the toilet) and snacks."
1025,4.0,Jan 2017,"Chicago, IL ",Disney lover,I was happy to see a park in another country. When you've been to WDW with all of the technology of magic bands and planning fast pass it's hard to understand why this park is behind. Pirates is totally worth it. Tron was cool. Shows are in Chinese but Jack Sparrow show was good anyway. Park seemed not busy to me but Soarin was 90 min wait and already out of fast passes. I would recommend Soarin if you have not already done it at another park. I like how the subway has its own stop and it easy. We also went from the park to eat in downtown Disney. As long as you have your tickets you can go back and forth.

1027,2.0,Mar 2017,New Jersey ,A fantasyland needs better management,"The newly built Disneyland has some very nice rides and shows such as Soaring Over the Horizon, Pirates of the Caribbean, and  TRON Lightcycle Power Run. Our overall experience was poor due to the lack of crowd control by local management company. We have had a much better experience in Hong Kong Disneyland, although it is a smaller park.We planned the two day trip long before the schedule and picked Tuesday and Wednesday to avoid the crowds. It turned out a big mistake. What we didn't know was the Shanghai Disneyland sells the quarterly season tickets to drive the sale without a proper crowd control in place. It was the end of March and all the season ticket holders came to visit. It was so crowded that we waited for 100 minutes for a 90 seconds fly elephant ride. The Fast Track didn't help either. The line for the fast track of Soaring Over the Horizon was longer than the waiting line for the actual event. There are scalpers selling the fast track tickets. I personally witnessed a family of three paid 500 RMB (about $72) for the fast track tickets that was supposed to be free.Another surprising thing was that some people were openly selling the fake Disney merchandise to the waiting line inside the park. No management intervened. I think that the local management company should have better crowd control in place and curtail the sale of quarterly season tickets and provide regular customers a true Disneyland experience they paid for. The season tickets give the scalpers a cheap way to getting into park and jam the fast track line for a fast profit."

But this was my 5th trip to Shanghai and I like Disneyland, so off we went.  It's 45-50 min by metro from People's Square station (6RMB each way).  I purchased the tickets in advance, but that doesn't save any money (just time).  The park is huge with lots of open space build in for expansion.  The line queues aren't as interesting as WDW ones.  There are bathrooms and trashcans all over the place. Warning about crowded days - culturally there is not a concept of personal space, so expect bumping, crowding, and shoving.  I also purchased the PhotoPass+, though that's changed so you can now only get a daily pass (199RMB) unless you have a seasonal pass.  But under $30 a day for digital downloads of all park pictures is still a decent deal.  "

Although it was a weekend, the crowds weren't too bad since it was still March and on the chilly side. I've been to the Anaheim one several times and it felt about the same size as that one. I was particularly impressed with the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, despite not understanding any Chinese. In fact, all of the rides are very well done. My only complaint is that there seemed to be fewer rides available. I think they could use another ride or two in each land.I was a little hesitant to go, being very familiar with how lines tend to be here in China, but it wasn't too bad. The staff does a fairly good job of keeping the lines in check. You do have to hold your ground though or people will just cut right in front of you. I didn't notice any problems with trash or cleanliness either. Overall, it was fun day with plenty of the usual Disneyland things to do."

People smoking in toilets, queue jumping and all. There was a man walking around trying to sell fast pass tickets to visitors. The management already had controls in place to prevent that. Fast pass tickets issued by the information kiosks are tagged to your entrance tickets. They are verified when you enter the Fast Pass lane. No way around that."

I don't know how other Disney are to compare. I think there should be more food options around the park and not constantly the same 4 options.

1033,5.0,Mar 2017,"Copenhagen, Denmark ",A new type of magical kingdom,"My partner and I came here for our honeymoon, and have visited every single Disney park across the globe. So as you can imagine, we were pretty excited to tick this off our list.The park itself is wonderful, and is very refreshing and different and breaks the same formula that the other parks use around the globe. The park is massive, and the paths really accommodate the giant crowds the place draws in. It has exclusive attractions that aren't seen anywhere else, and I would definitely recommend their version of 'Pirates of the Caribbean' and Roarin' Rapids.For a westener, being in China and dealing with the cultural differences was considerably challenging. We found the Chinese to be very loud, and very pushy. There is no concept of queueing and personal space. So be prepared to stand your ground and feel someone permanently touching you. There are also local residence in the queues selling knock off Minnie ears, which the locals snap up. I would say working with these challenges put a bit of a dampen on the whole experience, but If you go in knowing this is going to be the case, it shouldn't affect you as much. I also found it baffling that people would continuously throw their trash on the ground, even when they were standing right next to a bin. That being said, the cleaning crew are FANTASTIC, and are constantly sweeping the queue lines and the rest of the park, so it doesn't end up looking dirty for too long.The park has a great selection of attractions, multiple shows, character meet and greets and some really interesting and tasty sit down and fast food options. I would definitely recommend visiting 'Barbosa's Bounty' for some tasty, filling meals!As a new park, it is beautiful, but I do feel that it is missing a considerably amount of attractions. It does however have plenty of space for expansion, which is nice to see."
1034,2.0,Apr 2017,"Nanjing, China ",Walt is laughing from the grave!,"Our two kids loved their day out but frankly  it was ridiculously expensive especially when waiting accounted for 50% of the time we spent in Disneyland. Wait 30 minutes for a 90 second ride ... and there were longer waits too. I dread to thI was also concerned that when I checked ticketing online for our proposed visit that it returned off peak rates for our day. We were charged at peak rates, however, when we presented at the ticket office ... a difference of almost 400 RMB, about $50 US.  I was unconvinced by Disney staff assertions - especially as there is no published information to say what is and isn't a peak day. It still troubles me....What I would praise was the live Jack Sparrow show ... spellbinding for my kids for whom it was a first experience of a live show. I was also impressed  by the metro links in and out of the site.But too much queuing. "
1035,5.0,Mar 2017,"Bundaberg, Australia ",Awesome time at Shanghai Disneyland,"Definitely a great version of Disneyland. Was quite busy even on the two weekdays I visited, with long lines and most fastpasses gone by mid morning. They do now have the option to buy a fastpass (called Premier Access) but they are quite expensive. Ended up using this for Seven Dwarfs Mine Train or wouldn't have gotten on it - normal line was 105 mins, got on in 5 with fastpass. I would suggest getting a fastpass for Soaring Over the Horizon first thing, then heading to Tron while the normal line is quite short. Oh and get to the park well before opening time - the first day got there 10 mins before opening time, but after getting through security and the turnstiles it was 1 hour 5 mins after opening - super long slow moving lines."
1036,4.0,Mar 2017,"Anchorage, AK ","Clean Resort, Long Lines, Limited English ","The resort is well laid out and has a typical Disney look and feel. The lines were long, to the point we couldn't get an attraction ride in 3 hours.  It is not as big as the US parks, but felt bigger than the Paris park in the way it was laid out.  Lots of food choices, etc as you would expect however it is mainly a cash culture and very limited on English speaking although the signs are in English.  Not specific to Disney, but generally what we noticed in China - pay attention where you and your little ones are going and be careful crossing the path of people as in general they don't move and will run into you without any verbal notice or apology.  Also, don't expect to take turns in lines, be aggressive and speak up when it's your turn or others will jump ahead."
1037,3.0,Feb 2017,N/A,Fast Pass is Magical,"Overcrowded but there are fast pass. I got the fast pass for Pirates of the Caribbean and the Tron drive (SUPER WORTH) Pan Ride was fun but I got to say I LOVE THE FIREWORK that is what made this whole day magical!! Space mountain was HORRIBLE waited 3 hours and then the machine breaks down...but apparently this happens A LOT. Treasure Cove was pretty nice the food was good! Ate Mickey Mouse shaped corn pizza~ I appreciate how they keep the bathroom clean, I was lowkey was scared how people will be pooping in the streets or something. Employees were nice, I can tell they are trying~ My favorite would be Tron and Beauty and the Beast interior (will post photos).FACT: I been told by the employee that the Shanghai Disney have the biggest castle compare to all the other Disney Parks! ADVICE: AVOID GOING ON A HOT DAY"
1038,5.0,Mar 2017,"Palm Beach, FL ",Outstanding. Fantastic Technology & Rides,"This park is simply fabulous. It's new and beautiful and not at all crowded like Disneyland and Disney World in the USA. The streets are wider and there is so much more room to walk around. The rides are not only new, but high-tech. Pirates of the Caribbean will blow your mind, we rode it half a dozen times. Tron is a teenager's dream come true. Our children couldn't get enough of it. It's like Space Mountain enters the future. It's a beautiful ride, not herky-jerky. So much to enjoy about this park.  "

1040,5.0,Mar 2017,N/A,Best Magic Kingdom I've been to,"I have been to Disney in Orlando and Paris and I thought this was the best! It wasn't as crowded and as they were able to build from scratch the rides were the perfect combination of classic favourites and modern tech. Castle was breathtaking, queues were never too long if you were smart about it and for a Disney resort I thought it was value for money. Stay in a resort hotel and if you want to make your stay special, eat at the Royal Banquet Hall and get the VIP firework viewing. Amazing!"
1041,4.0,Nov 2016,"Karachi, Pakistan ",Magistic,"My first ever visit to a disney park, I ever since wanted to visit a disney land. This time on my business trip to China i got a chance to visit Shanghai and i had a day off so Disney land was on top of the list on things to do. I hopped on the Metro and left for Disney land. It was disney from every where. Althou i didnt enjoy much since i made this trip alone. You should definetly go with someone. the fun doubles. Great place recomended must visit when in Shanghai. "

1043,3.0,Mar 2017,"Santa Cruz, CA",Shanghai Disneyland,"We made it to Shanghai Disneyland! Had 18-hour layover from 6am to midnight with China Eastern Airlines LAX to Manila flight.  Got $300 in Chinese currency at departure airport in USA. Wife has Philippine passport and we couldn’t find out if she could do the transit no-visa so she visited Chinese consulate and paid $30 to get a regular visa. My daughter and I with USA passport needed no visa, and wife’s line was really fast but our no visa one took about 45 minutes.Weather report said rain all day so we brought rain suits and changed into them inside the airport terminal, our checked bag did not need to be retrieved, and our carry on suitcase we stored in an airport locker. Then we took a taxi to SDL, and even though I had a print out of the park name in Chinese and picture of Princess castle driver had a little hard time finding where to drop us off.  Driver turned around meter so we couldn't see fare and cheated us.Upon arrival on weekday walked to security and got through no problem, then waited for park opening. Even with the rain a lot of persons waiting to get in most with no rain gear or just an umbrella. Lady in line started screaming at her baby in a stroller. Presented passport at entrance turnstile to retrieve tickets purchased online. Persons entering ahead of us sprinted full speed off into the park.In the park went to Pirates and rode twice within 15 minutes, they use lots of big IMAX type screens which are not as impressive as real animatronics. Next Seven Dwarves single rider wife and I both in around 15 minutes, it is outdoors and rain hits the face, in single line they pair up with another rider I had Chinese young lady close next to me.With daughter went on Winnie Pooh and Peter Pan, Pan was better the ride is up in the air. Got Mickey Pizza for lunch, cold and rain and wind started getting to wife also jet lag catching up to us so decided to let go of your plan to reach downtown Shanghai and instead just finish SDL and go back to airport.  Many of the persons at start of day without rain gear seemed to have left the park.Disney app showing ride wait times didn't work for most of the day on Samsung phone with USA simcard and ATT International data plan, and many internet websites such as Facebook we could not access anytime while in China. We went counterclockwise around park and didn't waste time and energy crossing large park to get fastpasses or for other reasons.Went to Stars Wars Launch Bay, that was warm and out of rain.  Darth Vader was mean to kids including my baby daughter, he put his fist in her face and next group of kids he just stormed out of the room and they stood there bewildered and disappointed.Tron may be the best roller coaster in the world and best ride at any theme park. Sit on like a motorcycle and it accelerates really fast. No wait and there is a single-use two hour locker for no charge to keep your stuff in while on the ride. Jet lag really kicking in got disoriented during ride so couldn’t do it a second time.On way out of park walked through Princess Castle noticed persons climbing stairs that wind upwards from the inside, wind blowing through castle too tired and cold to attempt climb. Took taxi back to airport and retrieved luggage from locker. On way to airport noticed lots of very tall apartment buildings looked like stereotype communist terrible place to live.We weren’t interested in Soaring, and wished we could have seen some shows and viewed the outdoor sights, but on the plus side we did most of the best rides in a short period of time.There is free wifi at the Shanghai airport and had a hard time getting access code finally found it taped to the front of a machine that you are supposed to scan your passport to get code electronically."
1044,4.0,Mar 2017,Canada ,First Visit to Shanghai Disneyland,"I've been to California, Florida, France, Hong Kong and now Shanghai Disneyland. Still planning on Tokyo Disneyland. Disney World in Florida is by far the best with it's amazing wrist band access to your hotel room, entry to the Parks, payments for purchases, meals and Fast Pass. Be sure to bring CY money with you when you visit Shanghai Disneyland, as most of their retail stores and food courts will not take credit or debit cards unless they are from China. Only exception is the actually Disney retail store and the two Disney hotels (Toy Story & Shanghai Disneyland). Weekends are extremely busy with long lines for everything! You can purchase a Fast Pass for $60 Canadian dollars when the free ones are gone, not sure how many they hand out but it was a shock to me to purchase a Fast Pass from Disney staff. Since this will be my only visit, I purchased the Fast Pass to Soaring which was the new one showing in Disney World. It's not quite Disney as while many things look similar, they have different policies. No one lines up and it's so crowded that it's difficult to walk. While they rent you wheelchairs (my father needs one), it very difficult to maneuver with the crowds and the slopes within the park. The Wolfgang Puck, Cheese Cake Factory and Starbucks really do taste the same as in the USA. Although, Starbucks have made additions to their teas and pastry to include Chinese appetite and were quite delicious. Truly, enjoyed my pasta and cheesecake after many days of eating Chinese food."
1045,4.0,Oct 2016,"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia ",A fun day at Shanghai ,We were rushing for it as we expected there'll be lots of tourist and we wouldn't have enough time to cover the whole park within a day. And yes it's right for the second one. We just have to choose the one that we really want to. Tourists is expected but the cleanliness is well kept though you really have to be patience in queuing up for every attraction. The Tarzan is really inspiring for the kids & the fireworks show is the perfect ending for the theme park visit.

Must see the Marvel Studio, kids love it.  But there were too many people, we were not able to enjoy much facilities.  Always needed to queue for 2 hours to play a game, so gave up.Traffic is easy, metro will get you direct to the Park.  Need to prebook tickets."

1048,5.0,Feb 2017,"Luzon, Philippines ",Beautiful castle!,"Every time I travel to a certain country, I won't leave without visiting Disneyland Park. Here in Shanghai, they have a beautiful and very detailed castle in comparison with Hong Kong. But in HK, while you're in the train, you can already feel the magic because of its Disney theme handles and chairs but in Shanghai, it's just a regular train with a sticker of Minnie and Mickey mouse.We went there on March so the weather's very cold. Though they have coverups and towels in souvenir shops inside. We weren't able to appreciate the Disney parade that much since the language's in mandarin. But all in all, the park's beautiful and magical, as always. "
1049,5.0,Mar 2017,"Shanghai, China ",Perfect,They have done a great job of the park. As you would expect you have a waiting for some of the popular rides but on the whole it was really good. Park was clean and well organized food at the locations was very good. Parade and all the attractions were great. I just hope they maintain the pro and keep the standard. My only criticism was the hawkers when you come out of some of the shows selling unauthorized merchandise. I am surprised with all the cameras they haven't been removed. Especially when you come out of the Frozen show. Also men selling fast pass tickets. Hope they can find a way of locating these dreadful people and removing them. I did tell one staff but they were not interested. All in all a wonderful experience and well worth a visit ! 
1050,5.0,Mar 2017,"Albuquerque, NM ",Fast Trip to Shanghai Disney!!!!!,"We were done with our booked tour at 1pm so we decided to take the subway out to Disneyland and we are so glad we did. From downtown, it took about an hour but it was well worth it. When you get to the station, Disneyland is right there. No problem buying tickets and getting on in. We spent about 4 hours walking around and riding a couple of rides. Pirates of the Caribbean is amazing! We had a wonderful experience in a short time. Disney park number 4 off my bucket list!"

1052,5.0,Mar 2017,HK ,Excellent experience in Shanghai Disneyland,"I was in Shanghai Disney with my friends. We think some games are similar with Hong Kong one. However, some games are new to us. I think the fast pass is hard to get as there is very limited pass to customers. We tried to queue a motor bike games in two hours but only played in 1 min. Although the long queue made us very tired but we are very enjoyable in the wonderful park."
1053,4.0,Mar 2017,"Shanghai, China ",AWESOME,"We got the winter season passes and it was great. Almost every weekend we would go too Disney land and ride the rides, and eat ALOT.

1054,4.0,Dec 2016,N/A,Awesome!,"Awesome attractions and I was there friday and it is not very crowded. There are some more things currently under construction though, but It's still way way fun!

Get here early to take advantage of the skip the line tickets available at certain stations. Otherwise expect very long lines. Food offerings are... Interesting. The most edible thing I saw and ate was the chicken burger at the restaurant near the Tron ride. Stay away from the Berliner snack (looks like a doughnut). Public metro will get you there. Just expect a long ride from city center. "
1057,5.0,Mar 2017,"Singapore, ",Disneyland version 2.0 rated 5 stars!,"In summary: SHDL is Disneyland upgraded to version 2.0. Don't be put off by the bad press, Shanghai is a modern city and they take good care of the Disney brand. The cast members work hard and put a lot of heart into this attraction. SHDL will give HKDL a run for its money and has so much potential for expansion. It's going to be 'YUGE'!And now, an epic review, in no order of merit:1) we visited mid-week, and it wasn't peak season. Most of the rides had 20-30 minutes queues, Buzz Lightyear was constantly at 5 minutes, and the longest was 75 minutes for the mine train. Download the SHDL app for live updates on wait times.2) Fastpass i available but compounded by park goers unfamiliar with it. I think a number just went to queue for the FPs without knowing what they were. People also tended to block the FP entrances for the rides while waiting for their timing. Minor annoyance. They have info boards with the queue times for the different rides at each land, next to the FP kiosks.3) Everyone has to go through bag checks before entering to even buy the tickets. They check very thoroughly. You can bring any packaged foods in unopened packs and cans as well as whole fruit like bananas (I swear I saw someone bring in a huge pomelo) but no instant noodles.I also learnt that the Chinese visitors like to bring hard boiled eggs to the park. These were not allowed so there was a small frenzy of visitors desperately peeling and eating their eggs before they were allowed to pass.So if you want to be the first to enter the park, I reckon you will need to reach 30 minutes before opening to clear the bag checks.We didn't have to show our ID to enter the park (other park goers had to) but maybe it was because our IDs had already been checked at the Toy Story Hotel, where we were staying.4) Toilets: plenty, large, both sitting and squatting pans, and always clean. The cast members were furiously cleaning the stalls between users. Drink fountains are found outside each toilet.5) Food: there is no halal food in the park. A few vegetarian options (mushroom rice bowls, magherita pizza). Disneytown has Food Republic with Yershari, which is a well-known halal food chain in Shanghai and an earlier reviewer stated that it is halal but unfortunately we did not go and find out (ARGH). Would appreciate if anyone can update us on this soon :)Typical theme park food prices: meal combo was ¥60 for meal+drink, popcorn was ¥35 for a small box, pretzel was ¥30, Gatorade ¥15, tuna sandwich ¥55, fruit cup ¥35 . We saw an epic queue for turkey drumsticks at Treasure Cove.6) There were several incidents of queue cuttings. At the Eye of the Storm performance, we were almost mowed down by old men carrying babies. Another time, we had a bit of space between us and the people in front and this lady just waltzed past us to take it. We also saw the ""my kids are in front"" ruse (we watched the children push their way to the front while Mummy dearest followed behind, the queue wasn't even that long). It wasn't so bad because the park wasn't terribly busy but I imagine this ugly behaviour can really rile you up if you've been waiting for very, very long.7) It's becoming a bit of a Disneyland tradition for my son to get lost in the park. This time it happened twice in two days *rolls eyes* (in my defence we were actually behind him but he didn't see us and panicked). He went to the cast members who took him to Lost & Found. 8) There were a lot of staff at the park. Security, cleaning crew, cast members...most can speak English enough to communicate. We saw an angry mob outside the Frozen sing-a-long theatre, unhappy parents who were late to the show and confronting the cast members at the door. There were 6 security officers standing there, looking very imposing indeed.9) DO NOT MISS:Pirates of the Caribbean - the story is based on the movie and was a visual spectacle. Giant towering screens, advanced animatronics, the boat goes sideways and backwards. Worth 2-3 rounds.Eye of the Storm - a live stage performance with stunts and a WIND TUNNEL. seriously. It was in Mandarin but the gist of the story is a theatre company was doing a play about Jack Sparrow when the real Jack Sparrow (just as charming as the real one) appears. The British army comes to arrest Jack and chaos ensues. Very fun, full of action and did I mention the wind tunnel? A WIND TUNNEL.Roaring Rapids - so what if it was 9°C out? You can't miss a river rapids ride! Thrills, spills and a giant surprise. I think they went easy on us, given it was so cold out but I think during the warmer months you will get very wet. There are free lockers available outside and they sell ponchos for ¥10 at the queue although you could be enterprising and pick up the ones that were thrown away. Tron - Space Mountain on steroids. Both my husband and I are pretty big sized (he weighs 270 lbs and 6'2"") but we fit the Tron bikes alright. Each coaster also had a carriage at the end for riders who cannot sit on the bike. My 7 year old loved it so much he took it twice. You will need to put your bags in the free lockers outside the ride and there is a small compartment on the bike to store small items. Spectacles had to be removed. Gorgeous to see at night, with all the lights.Seven Dwarves Mine Train - Family friendly roller coaster, similar to Grizzly Gulch and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. Buzz Lightyear Planet Rescue - always a family favourite for us. They've updated the ride plus the high capacity makes queues go very fast. Pewpewpew!Character meet and greets - we saw Mickey & co, Spiderman, Captain America, Flynn Rider, Rapunzel, Cinderella, Belle, Kylo Ren, Darth Vader, R2D2 and a rebel pilot, Judy Hopps, Nick Wilde, Timon, Rafiki, Stitch. If you love your meet and greets this is the park to be at!Tarzan: Call of the Jungle - An acrobatic show like Cirque Du Soleil. Impressive stage and performance. Be prepared for another mob rush here.Once Upon a Time Adventure - you get to enter the castle and watch a multimedia retelling of Snow White. On my list of mehs:Soaring - I don't know why this ride was so hyped up. We were expecting something similar to Forbidden Journey at USJ but was very dissapointed to find out that it was more like an IMAX movie. The smells was the most interesting part of this ride.Crystal Grotto - I think SHDL is trying not to replicate rides that are also found in HKDL and TKDL, but they made a mistake with this one. This ride is a (poor and boring) modification of the Jungle Cruise. You just get to see some statues and fountains. 10) My husband was not feeling well during my first day there, so we went a little slow on Day 1 but it is possible to complete the rides in one day. Two days would give you a nicer pace to explore the park fully.We also saw touts outside the park (the lady was IN the queue selling Minnie headbands covertly) and inside the park (more ladies selling headbands in the queue and outside the toilets). They were also outside Starbucks and this old lady got aggressive with security. Harmless and interesting to observe their MO.11) We had dinner at the Royal Banquet Hall (character dining), they have vegetarian options available. a 3 course meal was ¥368 for adults and ¥258 for kids. Drinks were free refills and we had 2 baskets of bread. Service was very attentive. Mickey and co came in their royal regalia for photos. Food was decent. Diners also had the option to buy seats for the VIP viewing area for the 'Ignite the Dream' show at ¥150 each. It came with a large cookie and hot chocolate. The view was really very good. The staff were so strict about ensuring the exclusivity of the area, I had to be chaperoned to the toilet.12) An interesting park souvenir is the Magic Passport. It's a little booklet you can buy from the stores filled with park trivia and you can collect stamps from the Magic Passport machines around the park. When you complete all the stamps, you get a 'special collectors' stamp and they gave my kids 2 badge pins. The machine dispensing my last stamp actually broke down and I went to the Avenue M store to get some help. They managed to get me the last stamp to complete the collection :)13) The stores along Mickey Ave gave a 10% discount if you shop before 12 pm. They were also giving out plenty of free gifts with your purchases, we picked up kites, washi tape, Darth Vader pencil toppers and keychains. There were some park exclusive merchandise so don't go crazy at the World of Disney store outside.Overall.....we will be returning here soon. Very excited to see the park expansion.  We hope to see English translations of the rides available, like in TKDL and some English subtitles at their shows. Halal food options would also be icing on the cupcake."
1058,4.0,Mar 2017,"Rochester, NY ",Not quite 'Disney',"I have been to  DL (Disneyland) and WDW (Walt Disney World) and have friends that are CMs (Cast Members). This place doesn't feel Disney. I didn't see a ton of characters or CMs handing out stickers. Most CMs didn't bother to say Ni Hao. Some spent their time checking the hair in the mirrors or looking at their watches. I went on two different occasions with both low and high count attendance. Day 1 was rainy and day 2 a week latter was sunny. I really enjoyed Pirates and Tron. The pirates is based on the movies vs the classic story but I did enjoy seeing the nod to the classic with the dog and keys. The Pirate stunt show was entertaining even though I don't speak Chinese. I was a bit disappointed to be turned away from Stitch, being told ""no English, Chinese show only."" The Buzz lightyear ride is fun too, I'd say better than WDW. The park has a lot open space for expansion and generally I found the crowds easy to deal with. I didn't see any line skipping but personal space was at a premium. Granted I visited in March when the temps were 54F/ 12C. Soarin was still 150min wait though. Most other rides were 29-50min. The food is good. Mickey shaped Duck pizza is a good change of pace and the ribs at Barbosa's bounty are good.I did get to see one parade and enjoyed it. I was easily able to be next to the parade rope vs 5 deep at other parks. The biggest issue I saw was that after dark there we're people selling what I can only assume we're counterfeit goods in the ride lines and out in the open. They were not Disney employees. They were selling key chains and Minnie ears wrapped in cellophane. They also had fast passes for sale. I know this isn't the U.S. but I would think Disney would have tighter control over such activity given that there is an abundance of security visible throughout the park. Merchandise wise there's not a whole lot of Shanghai branded goods for foreigners. I found the best selection to be inside the park on Mickey Ave. vs the WDW store in Disney town. There's plenty of standard Disney goods that you can find in other parks. All in all it was an enjoyable experience. If you have kids plan on 1 to 2 days. True to Disney, be on the lookout for hidden Mickeys, I found a few and be ready to trade pins if you're into that."
1059,4.0,Feb 2017,"San Diego, CA ","Really, Really Long Lines","I have been to all six Disney Parks and would rate this fourth after Anaheim, Tokyo and Hong Kong.  It is a manageable size.  It has fewer rides than most.  It has one really great ride - Tron.  Lost of fun.  Fast start and fast ride.  Pirates was also good and different from the other parks.  The boat goes backward as well as forward and the ride relies more on animation than on animatronics.  There are two big problems with this Disney.  First, the lines are amazing.  Two rides had 3.5 hour lines.  This may have been a product of the fact some people were still on vacation from Chinese New Years.  The other problem was that the English signage was not that good.  It is worth going just for Tron, but be prepared for long lines."
1060,5.0,Mar 2017,manila ,Lots of space,"Embrace the Chinese-ness of this place, such as the occasional old lady who cuts the queue by coming in through the exit, or the pampered only child with parents, grandparents, and sometimes a photographer in tow, and you'll have a great time. Not to be missed is the Tron rollercoaster and Soaring over the Horizon. Sealed bottles of water and packed sandwiches and food may be brought in. One day is enough to spend here, but possibly 2 if you are with very small children."
1061,4.0,Mar 2017,"Selby, UK ",Good Day out,"My girlfriend and I went to Disney land for the day. It was a nice sunny day but it did not seem very busy, fast passes weren't really needed due to it not being busy. We were very surprised and I doubt it is this quiet all the time. We went on the pirates of the Caribbean ride, tron, buzz lightyear and over the horizon (or something with a similar name). All the cast members were great and all openly tried to converse with me English whenever possible. We enjoyed our day but I personally wouldn't want to spend more than a day there. Food and Drinks in the park seemed to be a fair price. All of the shops gave out free gifts with purchases too which I thought was a nice touch. "
1062,4.0,Mar 2017,"Kazan, Russia ",Shanghai Disney,"For Disneyland, it was ok, I did have a lot of fun, but it felt like there were aspects missing...staples that make Disneyland, well, Disneyland (back to this in a moment).  Granted, I have not been to a Disneyland park in several years, so I am not sure how things have changed if at all.  Pirates of the Caribbean is visually amazing!  Through parts of it, the boat you're on is going backwards, which makes it interesting, but just like most of the rides, it's not long enough for my taste.  Oh, and all dialog is in Mandarin, but it's not hard to understand what's going on, it's just amusing to hear the beloved characters speaking Chinese.  Peter Pan, The Seven Dwarfs Mine, Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, and the castle are all very well done and super cute!  TRON is awesome!  It's like you're inside the video game and the lightcycle coaster is super fast (Again, I just wish it had lasted longer!) which makes for great pics!  With Disney's acquisition of the Star Wars franchise comes a Star Wars exhibit, small and out-of-the-way which was a bit surprising, but we did meet Vader!!  Hope they do more with this, they could make it an awesome experience!!  Roaring Rapids was closed for scheduled maintenance and had I checked the website I would have known, but I wonder why it was scheduled for a Saturday??  When I visit a Disney park, I will not go during peak seasons, holidays, or other times that may draw larger than normal crowds.  I did not need fast passes, the lines for those were too long anyway, and I'm happy to report that the wait time for each attraction we went to (which was pretty much all of them) was not that bad (even Pirates and TRON), and the lines actually moved along just fine.  The Parade was good...Disney knows how to do it right!  The 8:00pm fireworks show was more of a fireworks/light/laser show, as fireworks are now apparently illegal in Shanghai, but I guess Disney has the ok for some.  It was a fun show to watch, highly recommended, especially if you have kids...they will love it.  Back to what's missing:  Splash Mt...what we thought was Splash Mt. is a ropes course. Fun, but we really wanted the log ride.  Space Mt...it's just not there.  Haunted Mansion...I was really bummed about this.  No Matterhorn.  It's a Small World...really???  Yep...not there either.  Really hoping these are in the works.  The cast members were all very nice and helpful, some language barriers at times if you're not from China, but still very helpful.  The park was easy to get to on the metro system but the metro closes by 10:00 or 10:30pm (even on weekends) so watch your time.  The food was not great, but the carmel corn was really good.  Even if you live in China and enjoy the food, which I do, I didn't care for the food at this park.  All in all, it was fun and we got through it all in one day.  As I said though, I hope they add more to it in coming years.  I give it a '4' because although we were disappointed in the lack of some things which we were looking forward to, Pirates and TRON totally redeemed the park's shortcomings!"
1063,4.0,Mar 2017,"Orlando, FL ","Pretty, Big, boring","I've been to all the Disney parks, this one is huge, and pretty (the parts that as less then a year old aren't already not being kept up like painted railing and such). There is a lot of space but not a ton to do yet. We had 3 days there, spent 2 fulls days and a 1/2 day in the space and by the 3rd day we'd done everything and where kind of board, something we've not had a problem with at all the other parks. but It was off season so no lines helped us do everything in the park very quickly. The Cast Members where nice and the shows where interesting. The rides where fun."
1064,5.0,Dec 2016,"Brisbane, Australia ",Amazing!,It lives up to all that is expected of Disneyland.  I've travelled to most of the Disneyland's around the world and this one is as good as the rest.  Wait times can be huge so ensure you get your fast pass when you arrive or you will miss out on the most popular attractions.
1065,5.0,Mar 2017,Christchurch ,Disney-fun!,"My first Disneyland and it was great. We arrived early on a Thursday, there were many people already but not too long to wait to get in. We got most of the fast passes which made it more enjoyable, but still didn't get through all the attractions.Tron was a great ride, the others were more for kids. I'm a big Disney fan and loved the whole day and the gift shop."
1066,4.0,Jun 2016,United States ,Easy access by metro,"It was very clean - as is usual in Disney. The ground is tiled though which I thought looked a bit dangerous - especially in wet weather.  Sure enough, I saw a man holding a small child running across to watch a parade who slipped and fell.  I had thought that due to its size it would have more than Disneyland or Disney World, but perhaps because it is new it seemed to be missing a lot of the rides.  I loved the soaring over the world ride (comparable to the California one in Disneyland).  One thing I'd never seen before was an adventure climb ride where you are hooked up to ropes and then walk adventure-style over various obstacles at your own pace.  I really enjoyed that one.  I was scared to attempt Tron but finally did and ended up in the front row - eeeee!  The parade is great. I spent two days there and that was enough for me to see everything I wanted to.  You can take the metro which lets you off right at the front.  You can also buy snacks at the metro stop to bring in with you.  I was there last June and the weather was hot but rainy."
1067,4.0,Feb 2017,"Singapore, Singapore ",Great experience if it's your first,"Prior to coming to Shanghai Disneyland, I was swarmed with bad reviews of how trashed up the place was by the locals. In addition, going through the lists of activities available, I felt underwhelmed. Nonetheless, towing a little one along, I felt this trip to Disneyland was more for the kid than it was for me.Arriving at Disneyland itself, I was pleasantly surprised to see the park was kept very clean and maintained the service excellence, cleanliness and friendliness that is the mark of Disneylands across the world. Park was clean, staff friendly, gardens beautiful, and entertainment great.Rides wise, it was disappointing to know there wasn't the signature Space Mountain. However, the Tron ride made up for it. Sharp turns with smart usage of the lights of the bike rides made it an enjoyable roller coaster. The ride was probably less than a minute and I queued less than 20 minutes. Worth the 20 but in my opinion not worth queuing for 45 minutes or more. There are more hair-raising rides in the world but I suppose you don't go to Disneyland for such rides.Other entertainment I encountered were the Frozen sing along (kid's Favourite). Long queues which subsequently fit into a big auditorium. Having loved the original English version, it is peculiar to me to hear the songs in Chinese. And even more peculiar was to hear Caucasian Anna, Elsa and Kristoff speaking in heavily accented Chineses. Nonetheless I will give them a 5/5 for effort but 3/5 for delivery.I waited till the end of the day for the fireworks light display. Having waited so Long, I was disappointed not to see any fireworks but rather a lighting display of various Disney movies flashed across a blackened castle. It's interesting nonetheless, but I was expecting the fireworks. Unsurprisingly, many people in the crowd left.All in all, a very pleasant trip to Disneyland. It's a great first time experience but if you've been to other Disneyland before, you will still enjoy yourself but maybe you will not be wow-ed. also, we went on a Monday which explains the shorter queues but might also explain the disappointing display at the end."
1068,5.0,Feb 2017,"Davao City, Philippines ",Disney is always fun and worth every penny!," We have been to Disneyland California, Disney World in Florida, HongKong and Tokyo Disneyland but Shanghai has a wider space for walking that people don't bump into each other easily and the best fireworks so far. We also liked the fact that they used the castle as a screen during the night show with the fireworks, just like the Fantasmic water show in Florida. "
1069,4.0,Mar 2017,Los Angeles ,Tron was worth it!,"We had a free day in Shanghai and took the train to Disneyland.  The train system is pretty easy to manage.  We went on a Friday in March, and I'm thankful that the park was not crowded!  It was nice to see a Disneyland theme park in its infant stages, there is definitely room to grow.  Tron was absolutely the best ride in the park!  We enjoyed everything about it.  I didn't like the food options in the park, most people bring food in.  There is no alcohol sold in Disneyland and after dealing with the long lines and rude people, we looked forward to a drink.  We walked to Disneytown for food options that better suited us and found several restaurants we were interested in.  Overall, this Disneyland can only get better."
1070,5.0,Feb 2017,"Denpasar, Indonesia ",Great theme park,"Good for everyone who love disney very much, nice park, very huge, cannot be finish it in 1 day and u have to be patient with the long queue in every atrraction"
1071,5.0,Feb 2017,"Land O Lakes, FL, ",We're from Florida and we LOVED Shanghai Disneyland!,"In February, after the Chinese New Year celebrations were over, it was sunny, not very smoggy, and the temperature was 40's Fahrenheit.  We rode the metro from our hotel in Pudong (45 minutes) and arrived at the new Disney station without any problem and at a very reasonable cost.  We were worried that it would be very crowded on a Sunday, but it wasn't.  We were lucky!  We rode the Pirates of the Caribbean twice, with the huge size and IMAX sized screens inside, it was so much better than the versions in the U.S. parks.  The Tron ride was like Space Mountain on steroids, another fantastic ride.  We heard it can take 2-3 hours to get on without a fast pass, but we got on in 15-20 minutes.  I don't know if you'd have such luck if you tried the same time of year, but if you don't mind cold weather you might consider it.  We enjoyed seeing the Tarzan show with many Chinese acrobats.  The intro and music was in Chinese, but that just added to the show for us.  The show at the castle included songs in Chinese and in English.  Again, a great show.We ate dinner at the Cheesecake Factory in Disneytown before returning to our hotel.  The food was good, and we had a nice conversation with the manager who was from Tennessee."
1072,5.0,Feb 2017,"Hartlepool, UK ",Wouldn't travel a long way to go but great if in the area ,"We came to Disney originally on a Sunday for peak ticket price 499 and for an extra 326 we upgraded to a season pass for the remaining Sunday's in the season (only a month was left in the season) so we've been twice now both Sunday's. Couldn't get on all the rides we wanted to go on in a day. When weather is good place looks amazing. When pollution is bad and sky is grey, not so much. Top tip I've found is get a fast pass for souring over the horizon as soon as you get in the park. They sell out along with dwarf mine train by lunch time and can get up to 180 min waiting time I've seen. Another tip is if you don't want to wait in the long queue and are either alone or don't mind riding alone, use the single rider queue.  Can cut waiting time down considerably. My partner found Tron amazing but too scary for me. Peter Pan/Winnie pooh/dwarf mine train are best suited if you have children. The main Pirates of the Caribbean ride is amazing. Discovery trail is also a must. Can be challenging if you choose the difficult routes but you can always switch to easier routes if needed. The Disney app is absolutely essential. Shows you waiting times, fast pass time availability, map and so much more. free Wifi is available all over the park so chinese sim is not necessary. I would suggest food at disneytown, still pricey but cheaper than the park. Cheesecake Factory portions can feed a small army. We stayed in the Disneyland hotel too. No perks other than access to wishing Star ferry and guaranteed ticket sale. I think coming here with kids is probably a more exciting day than just adults. Although all signs are in Chinese and English, the speaking in rides and shows are chinese. May be a bit frustrating for small children who don't speak Chinese and take a bit of the magic away. "
1073,5.0,Mar 2017,"Melbourne, Australia ",Bring a spoonful of resilience,"I tasked myself with doing this park in a day! I arrived at 7:50am and there were already queues at the security check. My taxi kinda dumped me at the side of the road, which is blocked for pedestrian entry - be sure to make them drop you off in a spot that is safe to access the footpath. They opened the park security around 8:30. Meaning you were at the ticket counter around 8:50. Make sure you bring your international ID if you book online. But also don't stress if you don't pre-purchase your tickets because the ticketing booths didn't have a line.This was my first Disneyland adventure so I had no idea what to expect. Having read reviews here I brought a backpack, several bottles of water, and a good range of clothes. If you're intending on doing the full day remember; it can be warm in the sun, cold in the shade and freezing cold at night during the light show. I went to soaring over the horizon first up and got myself a fast pass. (Rapids were closed for maintenance). I then lined up for the canoes which is right next door and got through in 10 minutes. (Wait time peaked at 40 minutes for the canoes and 180 minutes for soaring)Whipping around I went on the pirates ride, wait time was 50 minutes, but there is a solo rider option which meant I got through in 20. I then bee-lined for tron with a detour at Winnie the Pooh honey pots (heck why not!) Tron also has a single rider option with plenty of lockers for your belongings. Tron is a 40 minute wait but the single rider line was sub 10 minutes. It's an awesome ride and well worth the wait, though it is very quick, if I had a two day pass, I almost certainly would've done this more than once. Peter Pan was another of my fast passes, which helped me avoid another 1 hour queue. Another awesome ride.The parade was awesome, all your favourite characters. It starts on time and follows a fairly long route. I camped near where the Mickey Mouse meet and greet was; there's a two tier seating area - I recommend getting on higher ground for this because people put their kids on their shoulders which will leave you unable to see anything. I got to the spot 20 minutes before start time. The light show at 8pm had me smiling the entire time - I got there 15 minutes before start and it looked like people had been camping out since 7:30 (or earlier). Close to show start time they ask everyone to stand which means crowds start moving in, I nearly got trampled/mobbed when this happened, be careful, locals like to get ""all up in your grills"" keep bags close. At the end of the show, it's the same deal, I stepped aside and wandered around some shops in order to wait for the crowds to disperse. Be wary of creepy people approaching you to sell fake stuff (Minnie/Mickey ears/lights etc) there were heaps of them outside the park as well as inside - they loiter around queues. I saw a few of them get kicked out but some of them operate right near security with no consequence. I was taking a photo of something unrelated and one of them thought I took a photo of him and within a moment I had a bunch of thugs harassing me, it was scary and unnecessary. My thoughts: - dress in a way that allows you to dress up/down. - get there early- wear comfortable shoes- ride wise: use your fast passes! Don't miss: Soaring over the Horizon, Pirates of the Caribbean, Tron, Peter Pan. - There are plenty of toilets, use them when you see them so you're not stuck needing to go when in lineAs a bonus here's the parks name in Chinese :) ""Shanghai Disneyland resort""上海迪士尼度假区 "

1075,5.0,Feb 2017,"Atlanta, GA ",Feb 2017 Family Trip,"We are HUGE Disney fans.  Shanghai Disney did not disappoint.  Prices were very good for a one day visit (around $55-60 USD), and a 2nd day packaged together is even better.  Prices for food were average for Disney, but the merchandise definitely was 10-15% cheaper.  Plus anything from Opening Day was still on sale for 40% off, so got a few dozen Disney Pins.  Traded pins with everyone who were very excited to do that.  We spent all day there (9a-8p) because it is out of the city a ways and not easy to go back and forth.  We arrived 45 minutes early to get through Security line.  Purchase tickets on line for the day you need, then link to your passport.  Then all you do is show up at gate and they scan your passport and print you the tickets.  This park is the old Fastpass system with paper tickets.The only bad wait was Soarin (2 hrs) so we skipped it.  If you can, go right to it when you go in. The Pirates ride was broke all day but at 6pm it started working so we rushed on.  Best Ride Ever.  I would suggest doing it two times, even if you have to go single rider.  We rode Winnie the Pooh (just like WDW ride), did Peter Pan which was a lot better than WDW version, no small world though.  The tomorrowland was cool as Buzz was better since you cna move the toy gun around easier.  The TRON ride is to die for.  Do it during the day once to understand it, then definitely do it at night in the lights.  Try to get the front row as it is a magnetic roller coaster and you will NOT be disappointed.  Starts outside then goes inside like the Aerosmith coaster at WDW Hollywood Studios.Main street is smaller with less shops, but they have Downtown Disney attached to the park entrance which has 40+ shops and eating.  We ate at Cheesecake Factory.  You do not need a ticket to walk through that area.  Also has large World of Disney store and a Starbucks out there.If you go to Shanghai, this is a definite visit.  The park layout is spread out more so it does not feel as crowded.  Will go back every time we are here.  Very clean and Very Safe as well."
1076,1.0,Mar 2017,N/A,樂園建設好但管理須改善,"Waiting time almost 150mins on each area. Just waste the time. They didn't state clear enough, tripod not allow and need to placed in baggage area for cny80  item each day. As tourist, i think tripod is a must. Ridiculous. Some people in the queue but they are just push u, jumping, jump the queue. Surely it can be manage better it as it's a international company. A bit disappointed."
1077,5.0,Nov 2016,"Shanghai, China ",Fantastic World away from the busy city within the city,"It's not as magical or amazing as the one in California or Florida, but it's as elaborate or huge as they are. The attractions are similar to the ones they have in other parks, but the experience is as great. They have several people doing cleanup at the end of the day to keep the park clean. Park attendants are nice and friendly, but not all of them can speak English, but at least they are patient. I was told that we can get a First Time at the park pin, but it looks like they don't have that pin for first-time goers. The only setback I have to this is the local park goers. I personally think its the park goers that gave me the negative experience for this park. Even after 4mos of opening, there are still uncivilized park goers who let their children pee in the corner on the grass, when if they stepped out of the line, right next to the attraction is the Toilet! There are also several park goers who still spit on the floors, despite being told not to do so, and also smoke at the rides (indoors and outdoors)."
1078,5.0,Feb 2017,"San Bernardino, CA ",Disney world Shanghai,"The most amazing place!!!! So different then the ones we already know, this is totally different, pure technology, oh wow!!! Pirates of the Caribbean, haunted mansion, a must see!!!"
1079,4.0,Dec 2016,"Puchong, Malaysia ",Magical day,"I have been many Disneyland around the world, but this is the first time I visited Shanghai Disneyland, it was a good experience for me and my kids.To get there, I took the MRT which was really convenient, take line 11 to the Disney Resort station, then walk to the front door of the Disneyland (about 5 -7 mins walk), Q up to enter.The day I went was Friday of 16-December, not that many people, so we did not wait too long, my advice is you must pre-booking the ticket and go to the park a bit early.There are 6 main theme but I do not think it is possible to finish all the attractions in 1 day, especially with 2 kids of 9 and 11, but still, we complete 80%.The first thing when you enter the park, do not waste time on the Mickey Avenue, there are just shopping and restaurants, just go to Adventure Isle, there are 2 main rides there, but unfortunately Roaring Rapid was closed on that day, so we went to get a fast pass of Soaring over the Horizon, (this attraction you can not miss, a lot of fun), the fast pass stated time to coma back (no need to Q-up) was at 3.55pm. Can you imagine that? I got the fast pass at 9.15am but I was told to come back at 4:20pm!! Just show that how popular this attraction was.Without the Roaring Rapid, it was not really a lot of thing to do in Adventure Isle, so we went straight to Treasure Cove, we took a photo with Jack sparrow of the movie pirates of the Caribbean (my son loves it), before we Q up (only 15 minutes wait) for the attraction ""Pirates of the Caribbean Battle for the Sunken Treasure"", I personally think it was great, a must see attraction.Then we climb up to a big ship parked beside the lake, experience the life of Jack Sparrow, after that we departed to Fantasy land. We did not try the ""Explorer Canoes"", it is a just a normal of paddling expedition around Treasure Cove and Adventure Isle, nothing special, we no need to do this at Disneyland.Fantasy land has 5 attractions, (1) The Seven Dwarfs Mine Train  - I felt that it was just a small roller coaster for kids, nothing special, (2)  (3) Peter Pans Flight - This ride also for kids, Flying with Peter Pan across the sky of London, fun too, but not great. (3) Voyage to the Crystal Grotto - Just a boat ride to see the cartoon characters, suitable for age 5 to 10? (4) and (5) is Hurry pot spin and the Winnie of pooh is just kid staff. We stop by the castle searching for princesses, but did not see any, so we went for lunch at Pinocchio Village Kitchen, the food was not that tasty but extremely expensive.After lunch, it was about time for the parade, the parade was not as good as I expected, it lasted about 15 minutes, not a lot of Disney characters to be seen, especially princesses, we only saw Rapunzel, Elsa and Anna.After the parade, we went to the Tomorrow Land, There are again has 6 attractions, the main one was (1) ""TRON Light cycle Power Run – this is a Thrill Rides, excited, minimum height required, it was really fun. the other rides, such as (2) Jet Packs (Closed that day), (3) ""Buss Light year planet rescue"" suppose to be kid staff, (4) Star Wars Launch Bay (No time to visit), (5) TRON Realm, Chevrolet Digital Challenge, (No time to visit) (6) Stitch Encounter (No time to visit)   We also missed out ""Garden of Imagination"", we only managed to go to the Marvel Universe, inside there are some super heroes, interesting but we did not have enough time for details, I hope we did not miss much of this Theme because the other activities like Fantasia Carousel and Flying Elephant, all those are small kid staff.The entertainment shows: We went to 2 of them, as below: (1) Frozen: A Sing-Along Celebration (At Fantasy Land) - If you like the music and the movie, perhaps it is good for you to participate this wonderful music show.(2) Eye of the Storm: Captain Jack’s Stunt Spectacular (At Treasure Cove) personally I felt that this one is not good at all, they speak in Mandarin, with very heavy Chinese area accent, although I understand Chinese but I still feel their Chinese is hard to understand.(3) Tarzan: Call of the Jungle - Pity it was not open that day(4) Golden Fairy tale Fanfare - Did not see it(5) Club Destin-E at Tomorrow land - Did not see itAs for the Lion King Theatre, you need to pay separately and the price is very expensive.Overall we had a good time in this Shanghai Disneyland.I hope my experience can help you to plan your trip better."

I enjoyed a lot the environment here with music and kind staffs, Even though some visitor might smoke in the wrong place. The two major big show is must watch, Eye of the storm and Tarzan. Firework and the lighting show is also amazing and gave me a happy ending of the day. I highly suggest people should visit Shanghai Disneyland if you visit Shanghai👍"
1081,4.0,Feb 2017,"Holmfirth, UK ","Disneyland, but not as you know it!","This park is vast, slightly larger than the Magic Kingdom in Florida, but there is not that much to do for such a big park.  Yes, the Disney magic is there, but it lacks in some ways. The evening fireworks are not anywhere near as spectacular as they should be considering the Chinese invented them.  The staff are great though, obliging and firendly.  Definitely worth a visit, but don't get over excited."
1082,5.0,Feb 2017,"Colombo, Sri Lanka ",Must visit if you are a frequent traveller to Shanghai,"I'm from Sri Lanka and I have been to Shanghai quite few times for very short stays and this time I decided to allocate one full day to Disneyland in Shanghai. I checked into a nearby hotel called Gloria Plaza around 7 a.m. and took a taxi to Disneyland around 7.30 am. It was a Friday in February and by 7.30 a.m. I reached Disney. here are few tipsBe there at least before 8 am. (Chinese do come very early)I have heard it's better to avoid Weekends. Also the price of the ticket is cheaper in weekdays.Book ticket online and carry the Passport to verify. If you haven't bought tickets you can buy immediately after security check.  Chinese do run to the attractions. So no point trying to beat them.Run to ""Soaring Over the Horizon"" as quickly as possible and start the day with it. You may have to wait more than 30 minutes early in the morning for it, but it's ok.After it, search for FAST PASS distributing counters near Guest Services.If you get one Fast Pass then for next 3 hours you cannot get another.Try to get a Fast Pass to Roaring Rapids and Seven Dwarfs Mine Train near the respective Island Guest Services. I got a Fast Pass to Seven Dwarfs Mine Train. But had to wait around 1 hour for Roaring Rapids :(It's worth to check the Guest Services counters to see when they will start distributing fast passes. Queuing-up for Fast Pass still worth. You don't need Fast Passes to TRON,  as they are not very crowded. Fast Pass for Peter Pan's Flight and Winnie the Pooh is not worth. Get it for ""Seven Dwarfs Mine Train""Visit ""Buzz Lightyear Planet Rescue"" after 6.30 pm. No crowd at all.If you need to use wifi, uninstall Google Chrome and use default phone browser.Having the Disney Resort app in your mobile will help a lot. Unfortunately my wifi didn't work due to Google Chrome settings issue. But still I managed without the app.Make sure you do not miss the shows : ""Mickey's Storybook Express"" and ""Eye of the Storm Captain Jack's Stunt Shows"" and ""Golden Fairy-tale Fanfare"". Unfortunately I missed Tarzan show and can's comment about that show.All shows are in Chinese but not a big problem.While you are in the ride queues, you can check the ""Times Guide"" leaflet and plan your show times accordingly. These shows sometimes better than Rides haha.I repeat Do not miss Mickey's Storybook Express show.Food is expensive. If you are a budget traveler bring food in your backpack. It's easy if your backpack is not heavy.Disneytown is boring. Visit if you need a Posh meal.Check weather/season and wear clothes appropriately. I almost frozen to death in February even with warm clothes haha.Visiting Solo is not a problem. You can enjoy.Wear running shoes, you are going to have a full active day from 7.30 am to 8.30 p.m.Buy some souvenirs from shops. They will wrap nicely and ideal for gifts. Bit expensive though but Mickey mouse Mugs are bit affordable and ideal gifts if you have space in your luggage. 8 pm you can watch ""Ignite the Dream - A Nighttime Spectacular of Magic and Light"". But this was not a show that you need to die for. For me it was average, but still wait for it.After all done, at around 8.30 pm. or 9, better you directly go to your hotel and have a rest.You can't compare Universal Studios and Disney. Personally I liked Universal Studios Rides as they are more fun and suitable for adults. Comparably Disney Rides and bit Childish but the overall experience you get is awesome at Disney.Finally Do not miss Shows and Parades and Do not miss below ridesSoaring Over the HorizonPirates of the Caribbean Roaring RapidsTRONSeven Dwarfs Mine Train"
1083,5.0,Feb 2017,"Fremont, CA ","Bring your passport, take the subway, most of the attractions are in Chinese, with English subtitles.","The day I went I took the subway there and it was fast and efficient. You pretty much arrive a very short walk from the entrance. The cost to take the subways are about $1-2 USD each way compared to the cost of taking a taxi which will cost you more than $20.00 USD. When you get off the subway there are a few bakery's and shop there that sell some more reasonably priced foods so that's a great place to eat some quality food at more reasonable rates.I went on a Friday so the line for everything was shorter. A few of the attractions where closed. The pirates of the caribbean attraction and many of the shows were far superior to what I've seen in the states. The pirates of the caribbean show included a short segment, that started out looking like an illusion. It was actually a uncontained wind tunnel so what you see is indoor skydiving tunnel without the tunnel! The pirates of the caribbean ride was also amazing far superior to what I've seen in the Anaheim's theme park. The rides don't just go forward. And the screens are like a half dome pretty much giving you a fully immersive experience.A few of the Chinese don't believe in personal space. I had this couple literally pushing behind me and leaving no gap, like they felt like the line would go faster if they pushed. The only other downside to this park was the pricing of the food. You're pretty much paying what you'd pay in the states for the cost of food.Don't forget to bring your passport! And remember to use the Fast Pass options. Download the Disney theme park app to maximize your experience and see the estimated wait times. If you go to Tron or any other long wait attraction monitor the times thru out the day. It really helps to be onto of the wait times, a suggestion would be sure to go right before the parade or any other major events or show. There's also an nice adventure ropes course."
1084,5.0,Feb 2017,"Los Angeles, CA ","The Good, Bad and Ugly of Shanghai Disneyland","Wow! This new Disney park exceeded expectations with its level of detail, quality and scope. It takes the place in the Disney family of parks worldwide as one the jewels.I had seen photos of the park, read a few reviews, but nothing matched experiencing the park in person. The scale is huge, but still human. The castle is giant, but still charming. The lands are spread out and open with room to grown, but nothing seems undone or sparse. It is a beautiful park with stunning vistas, amazing attractions and some friendly cast members... but every now and then you will be reminded that you are in China, the same way a 400 lb. grandma in an electric cart slapping her granddaughter reminds you that you are in Florida. The GoodThe park and placemaking is beautifully designed and executed. The details are abundant and the finishes are top notch. The rides and attractions are outstanding and original. Old favorites like Peter Pan and Pirates of the Caribbean are reimagined for the better and new attractions like Tron and Adventure Camp wow with their technology, thrill and detail. It's best to be surprised, enough said. The place is huge and you could easily fill two days with all the live shows, rides and entertainment. Easily. Maybe three. The castle restaurant is an amazing experience and a must-do. It may be very expensive, but it delivers and must be booked in advance (impossible to do online unfortunately).In addition, Disneytown is also charming and top notch, with a great selection of restaurants and stores that really are amazing.The BadEntering the park in the morning is a nightmare. The crowds push, shove, smoke, sell fake tickets and fast passes, pull out the plants from the planters, and sell fake Disney merchandise with cast members watching (this also happen all day inside the park in queues and when watching shows). They sell fake Minnie ears and more. We saw the same 5-8 people both days, yet no one at Disney kicks them out. Hmmm? The UglyPork. Unless you like pork, with extra fat, ribs, greasy red meats and organ meat... your in-park menu is limited to three on menu items: a margarita pizza, fish and chips, and a fish sandwich. There was also a tuna sandwich to go, but it was sold out both days so I'm not counting that. I understand, it is food for the Chinese palate, but it was really repetitive and limited where we could dine. The UglyThe in-park cast member need to learn to smile. They don't need to internally feel happy, but at least learn how to look happy. They also need to clean up faster after parades and shows that leave the park looking like a trash dump. It was really surprising that Disney couldn't clean up faster. There is no or little crowd control at times and creates a very unsafe and dangerous feeling environment during the nighttime castle show. The crowd was borderline out of control and pushing, crowding and shoving so badly that is was completely unenjoyable. Disney is the master of crowd control so where is it here? But overall, this amazing park is a major achievement for Disney, China and Shanghai. It is one of the best Disney theme parks on opening day and looks like it will only get better. Go with an open mind, lots of money, and enough time... and remember ""there is always a toilet nearby"" (you'll see for yourself). Enjoy!"
1085,5.0,Aug 2016,"Guadalajara, Mexico ",The best Disneyland in the world,"This Disney it was recently open, and let me tell you something > is the Best Disney in the entire world, the areas are divided are huge all the personal speak a fluid English (some weird in China) the buildings are amazing the castle is unbelievable the characters almost real, the runway show  at mid day and  the lights show is different.you should go!!"
1086,4.0,Feb 2017,"Lima, Peru ",China Disney,"Overall, a pretty good Disney Park.  See Below:Arriving at the park, we took a taxi, which was easy to get to, and also to leave by taxi, so location, isn't terrible, as well as access to the park.  Security was probably the worst part of getting in, as in most Asian countries, they don't necessarily do single-file lines.Buying the tickets at the ticket office, you WILL need your passport.  Also, there is a ""normal"" price and a ""peak"" price, though they don't specifically explain what that means.  I had to pay the ""peak"" price (of course).  In February.  On a Sunday.They have a lot of new, high tech rides, as well as some of the Disney classics.  The food is mostly high priced Chinese food, but there are some delectables here and there if you pay attention. The lines for the rides were hit or miss.  Some were extremely long, and rather boring.  Not too much of a theme, or customer experience, but just sitting there.  Try and use the Fast Pass option as well as download the separate Shanghai Disney app so you know up to date ride times.  If you need ANYTHING Westernized, go to DisneyTown and get all your needs there.  The park isn't huge, but will definitely suffice for your Disney needs.  Was a good overall trip, but it's no American Disney Land or Disney World... at least yet anyways.  Good fun and recommended for family or friends.  Once anyways.  I'd pass on a yearly season pass.  Simply not THAT much to do there.  Enjoy!"
1087,5.0,Sep 2016,Orlando ,"Great, yet different, Magic Kingdom style park","I had been to every Disney Park in the world until June, when Shanghai Disneyland through that off. I made it out in September 2016 and Shanghai Disneyland did not disappoint! It is definitely in my top 5, potentially in my top 3, behind Tokyo DisneySea and Hong Kong Disneyland. It is a different type of park though, with lots of Chinese influence, which is Great! DisneyTown is a lot of fun too. We were surprised to find Ippudo Ramen there!The hidden Gem here that no one seems to talk about is the Camp Discovery Challenge Trails. WOW. They make you feel like Indiana Jones! Unbelievable. The stuff you hear about really is great; the Tron ride, Soarin', Pirates, the Pirate stunt show, the Tarzan show - all fantastic. The park is different because it's HUGE. Standing in the Pirate's area and looking towards the Castle, you feel like it could be a mile away. The pathways are massive too. The big thing that makes it feel different is the lack of kinetic movement. In most Disney parks, there is always movement. Ferries, boats, vehicles... everything is moving. That's definitely missing from Shanghai Disneyland. However, it makes for a more laid-back and peaceful park experience. Love this park and will definitely come back."
1088,5.0,Nov 2016,"Dallas, TX ",Tron ride!,"Smaller than the other Disney parks, which is a plus on my book. Got to ride the new tron ride. Also if you want to buy the Disney hat and put your name on it you will need your passport, weird but true. "
1089,4.0,Feb 2017,"Shanghai, China ",Worth visiting - but embrace china's que etiquette,"I've been to all Disneylands, except for the one in Orlando....and this rates in the top half of the list through Shanghai disney's strength/effective use of their latest entertainment technology. Not sure if the other Disney's I've visited a few years ago have gone through similar upgrades of recent though, but SHD's fireworks show with cinematics and water fountains by the main castle was very impressive, plus the whole design setup of tomorrowland....and ""tron"" ride, gives this Disney a very futuristic feel to it.Biggest tip for Shanghai Disneyland:1. Embrace the line cutting and overall general bad queuing behavior. It is understandable that some people will want to hold their ground against que-cutters....my advice: it's just not worth engaging. The Disney staff are impeccable, but it's just quite a few local guest which simply cannot behave in a que, it's quite a mainland China phenomenon unfortunately. We had people cut in front of us mentioning ""VIP pass VIP pass"" which doesn't give them the privilege to cut the que to the entrance of the park. We had others saying they are looking for their family so cut inside the que from behind us. Plus we had a local continuously scuff the back of my shoes in excitement/eagerness to get on the ride.You just got to not let this bother you....take it with a smile on your face. None of these guys were aggressive....only ignorant, many I guess just don't know any better. If there is an unbearable person behind/in front of you in the que....just hang back/let them get in front of you.....this is much better having to wait a few more minutes, then constantly being vigilant/grumpy over uneducated que cutters. This was my only negative I could say about shanghai's Disneyland...everything else was aces!!!!"
1090,5.0,Oct 2016,"Melbourne, Australia ",Great place to visit with things to do the whole day!,"We decided to visit the recently opened Disneyland in Shanghai, which wasn't too busy given we went on a weekday. In fact, it was less busy than I expected!It is meant to be the biggest Disneyland in the world and it is definitely large, having been to others around the world. It is very organised so that it is very easy to navigate from one world to another, as each world is distinctly separate. This was definitely the most technologically advanced Disneyland with awesome visuals and 4D effects, particularly in the ride with the big screen where you felt like you were flying around the world. In fact, you could smell the dirt when you were 'at' the Taj Mahal and the grass on the safari in Africa. Being from Australia, it was great to see the Sydney Opera House and Harbour there too. The Tron ride was also great too, and a very fast ride. On another note, there were also heaps of toilets which were always very clean and they were easy to find which you don't say about many touristy places. Food there is very expensive, much more than the other Disneylands even I think. I would recommend bringing in your own food if you are on a budget. Definitely a place to visit in Shanghai! It is easily accessible by train but does take a while to get to from the city. "
1091,4.0,Jan 2017,"Saratoga Springs, NY ",Disney Chinese-Style,"This park is a lot of fun, but no surprise, very crowded.  The park setup is similar to other Disney theme parks with the exception that it is tailored to Chinese economics.  It is cheaper than most Disney venues to get in, but once inside there is not as many retail establishments simply because Chinese do not have as much disposable income to spend on food and souvenirs; the Chinese mostly bring their own food in.       This park is built for the Chinese tourist and I did not see another Westerner, other than Disney supervisors, during my entire day in the park.  Right now there aren't very many rides which causes overcrowding and long waits very quickly.  The rides were very good, however, especially Tron which is a roller coaster-type ride.  You launch catapult style riding a light-cycle, quite spectacular!  The most popular rides are the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train (fast pass and single rider line available) and Pirates of the Caribbean (no fast pass option, but has a single rider line).  The fast pass system is similar to LA Disenyland's although the lines just to get a fast pass can be just as bad as waiting for the ride.  Get there early to get as much done as possible early.  Once the crowd arrives in earnest, there's not enough attractions to keep the lines from getting ridiculously long.  There are so many other things to do in Shanghai, that I would not make this a priority unless you're a Disney fanatic.  Even then, just plan an early half-day visit to satisfy your curiosity."
1092,5.0,Jan 2017,"Moscow, Russia ",Pure magic,"As I am one of those lucky ones who visited Disneyland twice, I must share tips and advices.I strongly advise to plan visit on weekday rather then weekend or public holiday. 10 days before Chinese New year park was packed and people spent 2-3 hours in lines to get to 5-10 minutes rides. You certainly don;t want to spend almost 500 RMB and waste your visit for waiting do you?Experience shows that on a little bit gloomy day park is not so crowded and you can enjoy yourself times more!Be sure to visit fast-pass counter at Guest Services to speed up getting on the attraction. It's free. But last time there was a line there too.There is quite a lot of food options, strollers for kids, etc.Plan your visit wisely :)"
1093,4.0,Feb 2017,"Happy Valley, OR ",Happiest Place on Earth,"It's obvious that a lot of effort was put into this park, just like any other. It's very cool and uniquely Chinese. The castle is stunning and the firework show at the end of the day is a MUST. I did buy food in the park, but just from a cheap stand. If you're looking for western style, I managed to find hot dogs, pretzels and churros that didn't set me back too far. Otherwise there are a lot of popcorn stands and ice cream as well as themed restaurants. If you're looking for a rollercoaster or thrill ride, you won't find it here. Tron was fun but similar to Space Mountain in Disneyland California. The seven dwarfs train wasn't anything special and definitely wasn't worth the 90 minute wait. Pirates of the Caribbean was amazing, I wanted to go on it more than once but the line was too long. The Alice in wonderland maze is fun for pictures but somewhat short. There aren't tons of rides so many of the wait times are long but there is cool stuff to look at. Everything is in Mandarin but don't let that scare you off. You still feel the Disney magic and there are always instructions and hints in English. Most staff speak some English just in case you need help or clarification."
1094,5.0,Nov 2016,"Wrea Green, UK, ",A must do!!,"Being a big Disney fan this was the last and final park we had left to visit. Beforehand we'd heard many horror stories on what we'd experience here. All of which were largely absent from our trip. Queue management was very strict, queue jumping was rare, staff were some of the friendliest and helpful we've experienced and the park itself was immaculate. Add to that some of the best Disney attraction around in Pirates and Tron and you have an amazing Disney park, a must do!!"
1095,4.0,Oct 2016,"Manchester, United Kingdom ",Disney on a huge Scale!,"Incredibly lucky to have visited Shanghai Disneyland in the first year of its opening. The park is huge, and the Enchanted Storybook Castle makes an impressive centrepiece-visible from the Maglev from Shanghai Airport!Quite a few departures and unique attractions set this apart from the other parks , though it will look even more impressive as the landscaping matures.The TRON ride is the big pull here, and it's certainly an amazing coaster with ingenious cars and the theming is stunning. However, the Pirates of the Caribbean is fantastic. Completely revamped its unlike any of its name sakes in the other Disney Parks, the technology on this is unbelievable. Some truly breathtaking moments.If you only ever plan to go once, I'd leave it a couple of years to let the park mature. But do go-the Pirates are worth it alone.Easy access by taxi from the centre of Shanghai. There is quite a long walk to get to the park from the drop off area. If you book tickets online first, take the reference number and photo ID to show when picking them up."
1096,4.0,Feb 2017,"Buenos Aires, Argentina, ",DisneyTown - A Disney Marketplace for Kids,"Disneytown is essentially a marketplace (opened in May 2016) at the Shanghai Disney Resort (opened in June 2016) offering: shopping, such as at the World of Disney Store which attracts the majority of children . . . even though parents may find the prices on the high side; various regional Chinese, Southeast Asian and international cuisine; Walt Disney Grand Theatre where The Lion King is playing and other entertainment. This 46,000 square metre Disney marketplace is located in the Pudong district of Shanghai, close to Shanghai Disneyland Park. It is easy to get to by taking Shanghai Metro Line 11, exiting the train at Terminal Station Disney Resort. Admission to DisneyTown is free, as should be for what is essentially a marketplace."
1097,3.0,Jan 2017,N/A,Not as expected,It was my first time visiting Disneyland and I must admit I was a bit disappointed though it was a very cool experience. The park was beautifully made but the attractions was mostly for small kids. I'm glad i went but one time is enough.

1100,5.0,Jan 2017,"Nanjing, China ",Very good impression ,"We went there basically during the Chinese New Year, so the crowd was just too big. Waited for more than an hour to pass the security and get into the park, but once we were there it was amazing. Really clean-which is a thing you rarely see in China (the facilities were also kept in a good condition). There are places to snack all throughput the park. We waited for 4 hours for the Tron ride, just to enjoy it for 1 minute. The staff was friendly, speaking English and really helpful. I was happy with my visit, the crowd made it harder, but with that many people there is no other way to go. Also, Disney advertises that the castle is the biggest one yet. The fireworks and light show were amazing, worth the wait."
1101,4.0,Dec 2016,"Hong Kong, China ",Surprisingly Good,"Disclaimer: I love all things Disney.I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this was surprisingly good.Much larger than Hong Kong, with many more opportunities to see different characters.Always go early to Disneyland. Generally it's not as busy as later in the day, when lines can get quite long and tedious. The only thing about this Disneyland in particular is that there isn't much English. Around the park there are some English speakers but ALL the shows are in Mandarin.Other than the language barrier everything else was great. There's even a Disney Village just outside houses a number of restaurants and shops and is open later than the park itself.I'd return for sure."
1102,3.0,Nov 2016,"Everett, WA ",Ok but not great!,"The park is brand new but it doesn't feel that way. I like that the Metro has a stop right at the park, that is convenient. Overall, I would go back for my kids but there wasn't much appeal to it."
1103,4.0,Jan 2017,"Erie, Pennsylvania ",Large Crowds,"Got a chance to visit this new attraction during a recent business trip. I was curious as to how it might compare to Disney Land in California and Walt Disney World in Florida. What I found was a very well designed property with lots of attractions. However, I was very disappointed at the amount time it took not only for the preliminary security check, but also the extremely long lines to get into the park. It took well over an hour just to get into the park and then the lines for the major attractions were extremely long so I only got a chance to sample a couple of attractions including the parade  which was very well done. The park is large and offers something for most everyone and was very interesting with many food options from American to Chinese. I would suggest arriving early and taking advantage of Disney Fastpass if you plan on riding the attractions. There is a subway terminal at the park which makes it convenient to get to."
1104,3.0,Jun 2016,N/A,Not a magical kingdom,"The latest addition to the Disneyland family needs to grow up before it can lay claim to being a magical kingdom. Whilst the hardware of rides, restaurants and retail are generally Disney quality (minus the recent glitch with the Soar Over the Horizon ride), it's the software that is sorely lacking. The mainly mainland Chinese visitors are rudely loud and few understand the meaning of needing to wait in line. The staff manning the rides have been seen to yell at the visitors to behave... but sometimes who can blame them. And the cleanliness ... sigh...I hope it's only growing pains and that this new born will grow to be a fun lovable and magical land."
1105,5.0,Jan 2017,"New York City, NY ",A very fun experience with the right expectations ,"We thought that overall the park was clean, the people were friendly, the merchandise was varied and unique to shanghai Disney and some of the rides are the best at any Disney park.   We witnessed some line cutting but that was definitely the exception not the rule.   Everyone seemed to bring snacks which they eat while they wait for rides which makes sense cause some of the waits are insane.   Try to get there early and fast pass something popular then go on a ride you want as the early morning lines are not too bad.   I believe it's less crowded on weekends because it is a bit more expensive.  The metro goes right there to the park (there is a bit of a walk) and is super convenient.   Get a round trip metro pass at least since you do not want to be stuck in a ticket line when you are leaving the park as everyone stays for the fireworks and leaves at The same time.  Pirates of the Caribbean and the ride that goes under the magic castle were both amazing.    A bit hectic getting inside the park with a security check and a shockingly lo tech ticket collection process where they look you up in the system but all in all it makes for a great long day.  "
1106,5.0,Jan 2017,"Melbourne, Australia ",VIP tour - worth it!,"Came here with my family on a cold winter's day in January 2017. As we spent the morning having professional photos taken, and only the afternoon to spend doing the rides - we opted for the VIP tour. Although significantly more pricey than the normal entry passes, it made our visit much smoother and pleasant. We had 2 young children with us, and enjoyed priority entrance to all rides. The standout rides were Soaring, Tron and Pirates of the Caribbean. As VIP guests we also enjoyed access to special viewing areas for the Disney parade and fireworks display. The fireworks display was absolutely amazing, highly recommended.Overall we did not find the previous reports of unruly crowd behaviour, littering, or poor English of the cast members to be part of our experience during our day at Shanghai Disneyland."
1107,1.0,Jan 2017,"Shanghai, China ",Lines are way too long.,"It took quite a walk from parking and then one hour to get through a huge line for security first and then another huge line for park entry second (with pre-purchased tickets). I've endured long waits at Shanghai airport occasionally, but never anything like this. The lines were good training for the experience inside though. Even a simple 'canoe experience' (sitting for ten minutes in a canoe with twenty or so other people while holding a paddle) had a 75 minute line. When I went to the bathroom I went through a gate into 'Disneytown' and needed my entry ticket to get back in. We were with five of us. My girlfriend had held the five tickets but gave each of us a ticket back after we entered. Turns out I had my daughter's ticket. When you enter, I found out, a picture is taken and then stored attached to the ticket. I could not see I had my daughter's ticket, but they could see it. They could of course also see on their computer that I had entered at the same time and they could see my picture. I also had receipts from a purchase inside the park. But could I get back into the park? ""No. Wrong ticket. Procedure. Let me explain to you sir. For your safety. For everybody's safety."" When I walked through the gate anyway, they tried to physically block me, but I kept circling and I walked on smiling anyway, inviting them to follow along. I had no other option, my phone was out and I had arranged to meet everybody at 5pm at a cafeteria across from 'the flying elephants'. One manager (Mr. Travis) and a security guard followed me all the way to the cafeteria where I had arranged to meet the family. Then they complained they had to wait so long (cause the lines are so long the family did not arrive at 5). Then they called a senior manager (Mr. Jonathan). He called more security after trying to explain to me that he understood what had happened with the ticket, but that procedure was the important thing. In the end there were six security guys and two managers surrounding happy little me, sipping hot chocolate, insisting I needed to go to 'guest services'. But I just refused, meaning they'd have to take my chocolate drink and carry me. Luckily China is a very non-violent country, especially if you remain kind and reasonable and smile happily. I don't blame those security guys of course. But management of this place needs some serious re-education. No wonder the lines are so long. All the security guys are busy surrounding innocent elderly foreign visitors sipping hot chocolate. Finally the family appeared. The idea was still that we should go to guest services to get my ticket looked at by the machine, but by now management had lost its enthusiasm for pursuit of idiocy and just wished all of use much additional enjoyment. Jonathan even took our picture. So I had a very interesting, exciting and educational experience even without going on a ride :-)"
1108,5.0,Oct 2016,"Jakarta, Indonesia ",Super Big!,"Went to the one in Hong kong, compared to it, this one has a total different size of place. It is not as 'international' as in Hong kong.

There are long walks between lands and the crowds are just way more than we expected and we went on a low-time week day (as opposed to weekend).   Disney needs to do better....2 major rides were down, and 3 major rides had cures of 2+ hours, with one at 3.5 hours.  At one point I was thinking, here we are paying for 5 persons expensive tickets so that we can walk all day around the park because we just couldn't get on any rides.  We have always loved the Stitch show, but this time it was in Mandarin.  The Fast Pass system barely works...we had to line up for 25 minutes to get a singular (one only per entrance ticket) ticket to the Buzz Lightyear 1 minute attraction which was scheduled for 2 hours later so we had to walk away (to other lands) and return (from other lands just for this show).  The highlight attraction was definitely the Pirate boat ride - absolutely amazing...just too short.  A good idea is to separate the restaurants which remain open after Disneyland closes."
1110,3.0,Jan 2017,Sweden ,Wrong time to visit,"We visited on a Friday thinking it will be better than a weekend. Unfortunately, we didn't consider that school is out for winter holiday so every kid and teenager were out enjoying the sunny winter. Temperature also dropped to a windy negative. I had high expectations but it fell short.Pros- new and huge space- Eye of the Storm was entertaining and fun; TRON ride is a must for adult- a DJ playing in Tomorrowland ready for anyone who is up for a dance- Disney APP which helped us find where people are fewer and schedule of shows- Location; metro line 11, exit 1- Disney Town; many shops and restaurants to choose from; you can go in and out for the day using your ticket- lots of Disney cast aroundCons- despite it being new; rubbish are everywhere even indoors- huge but looks messy and too spread out- lots of cast; very few speaks english- shows and even the songs are mostly in Chinese; it is very clear that it is ONLY targeted to young Chinese since they are the only ones who were able to know Disney from a young age. - parade and fireworks have mostly the new Disney shows especially Frozen which is one of the few Disney stories the audience know. - it being in China, prepare to experience the shoving, cutting of lines, loud conversations and arguing/fighting. In one day, I saw more than 3times of parents arguing on who pushed who.Tips- come early or you have to queue up for the manual bag inspection for some time.- plan your day using the APP so you can organize your day. some rides have waiting time of 2 hours.- Eye of the storm; try to sit on the front rows to have a better experience- Have a meal in Disney Town especially Food Republic for affordable alternatives- To enjoy the fireworks, come early to find a spot; when it starts you mostly can see head and hands with camera if you come late. I love Disney and visited Disneyland in other places a couple of times but this one is only good for one visit. "

1113,4.0,Jan 2017,"Thousand Oaks, CA ",Expect long lines and they close the park when they feel like it.,"We went on a weekday during January thinking we would avoid the crowds.  It took a long time to get into the park, and when we arrived (one hour after opening) all fast passes were sold out and average wait times were 1.5 hours!  We went on two rides, Pirates and Tron, watched the parade (which was great!) and walked around the park to soak Up the sights.  Tron was a thrilling ride, but the wait time was an estimated 130 minutes...we found it was closer to three hours before we got on the ride.  You wait and wait and finally are sent to a line that takes you into a room with a glass wall, the wall become transparent and you can see the other riders taking off!  Great, we thought!  We are getting on the ride finally!!!  Wrong, you leave this room only to line up for another 45 minutes!  Ugh.  But the ride is really smooth and fun!  Before Tron we caught the parade, and finished Tron at 8pm, in time for the fireworks!!  Park was supposed to be open u til 10pm with fireworks at 8:30...wrong again, apparently the park closing time has something to do with the number of folks visiting, and this night they closed at 8pm and had moved the fireworks to 6pm without notice (we missed them as we were in line for Tron at this time). I heard the night before they closed the park at 7:30.  So keep this in mind, and maybe ask around a lot about park closing time.  Also be prepared to wait, and get In line well before opening to be one of the first In the park to get the fast passes, they are handed out and gone very quickly.  Food is really expensive, so bring in your own food.  It is allowed (as are water bottles) the picnic area was packed with people bringing their own food. Your bags are checked at least once, maybe twice security is tight here. I give this a four because they do a good job at presenting the Disney Experience in a foreign country, but the lines and wait times are extreme so be prepared."

Now, when it comes to the waiting, you need tons of patience. Some rides will have average 120 minutes waiting time, and fast passes go fast, so go early and get the fast passes before they are out. Also be careful when in line, as most people won't respect the order and will try to get in front of you, it's ok if it's only one, but most do it, so that would set you back a few extra minutes.Enjoy!"

1117,5.0,Jan 2017,"Singapore, Singapore ",Great new Disney Park,"Great new Park with new rides and a spectacular fireworks, projection display to end the day. Easy to go via Subway Line 11.  Do allow about 1 hr to travel there from the city central. Went on a bright sunny Monday, thinking there will be less people but I think the locals look out for the weather. It was crowded at opening time 9 am. Security check  took about an hr. The crowd can be overwhelming, loud etc  but do focus on the greatness of the rides. Even the locals were complaining about the queues. But then again some will also sigh ah..it is China after with 1.3 bil population.  So just embrace it. A must take on definitely Tron.  Very cool!  U will forget everything after this ride. Pirates of the Carribean was also awesome,  and the snow white storybook.  Shanghai disney uses a lot of new technology for the attractions. If you want a breather, try to dine at The Royal Banquet Hall. The food is nice,  and of value,  international standard and you get lots of photo opportunities with mickey and friends. It's a 3 course meal with drinks. If you want to get gifts, the mega big store when u exit at Disney town sells the most variety. Overall,  I would like to visit again as one day is not enough to cover everything.  there are many live shows too. As for Disney magic, you can feel it when its just open as crowds are a bit anxious to cover everything in a day..but as the day goes by.. to evening... Everyone relaxes and u get to hear the background music more... And it's less crowded. U can feel the Disney magic is actually there all along."

Easy to access by MRT Line 11. Children below 1 meter are free of charge. RMB 50 for luggage storage fee.

However, to spend time with our family, we decided to take the chance and go on last day of 2016. It turned out to be a nightmare when I, holding my 3-year old, encountered a young couple cutting in line in front of us, after we had waited in line for 40-minitue to get in the honey hunt in forest with Winnie the Pooh.  Riding Pooh's honey jar was my 3-year old's favorite part of that day, unfortunately.  Just seconds after we entered the last portion of the line before getting on the honey hunt with the Pooh into the forest and stood at the end of that line, a young couple with the lady wearing a bright yellow jacket came in from behind from the fast lane.  The guy immediately stepped in front of me.  At that time, I was holding my 3-year old in my arms, standing tightly in the line.  I asked him to step back behind me as that's where he belonged.  He did.  Then my son asked me a question about the story on the wall, while following tightly in the line, I turned my head slightly to answer him.  A couple of seconds later, I turned my head back, shockingly discovered that lady with yellow jacket stood in front of me almost like a velcro attaching her to the person before me.  That person was a mom with a 8-year old boy.  We had chatted up in the past 30-40 minutes while standing in line next to each other and my 3-year old was playing with her and her son.  I told the lady she's cutting in line and asked her to move back.  To my surprise, she started to argue and ridicule me for my request.  That was beyond un-acceptable.  It was utterly disappointing that no staff was in sight to help during the entire 15-20 minutes when I had to deal with this lady.  Finally I got her move back, but her boyfriend cut in front of me from the other side.  Wow, at that point, I felt so angry and not safe.  I felt with him too and finally got him to step back where he should be, but he was saying those words that one would not want to hear.  At this time, a male staff came asking ""what happened,""  I told him these two cut in line.  The staff said ""we're almost there.  Please be patient everyone"" then left.  Right after he left, the young couple started disrespect words towards me that were unbearable.  Thankfully a kind dad of two boys in front of the line grabbed me to his position and switched with me, which saved me from the horrible encounter!  It ruined our first disney experience.  I did not feel safe to be there with my little boy, and will never want to come back again.  Unfortunately, Winnie the Pooh was my little boy's favorite part of his first disneyland experience!In my opinion, and common sense, ShangHai Disneyland is responsible for providing a safe space for customers.  Our terrible experience proved their failure to fulfill this responsibility.  Hope that they will create a management system soon to protects customer's safety and rights, and only then there will be foundation to even begin to discuss client satisfaction."
1120,5.0,Nov 2016,"Minneapolis, MN ",Disney Magic in Asia,"We thoroughly enjoyed our day at Shanghai Disney. I'm not the biggest fan of amusement parks but it seemed like seeing the newest Disney park on our China trip was an opportunity not to be missed. First, the access is great (the subway line ends within short walking distance of the entrance) and the price is right ($50ish US dollars for a one day ticket).  Once inside, we were surprised by all the artistic details and loved the beautiful murals, themed banners, and other decorations.  There was a good balance between rides (be sure to ride ""Tron"" the motorcycle style roller coaster) and experiences like the ropes course and an Alice in Wonderland garden maze.  Perhaps my favorite difference between Shanghai and Magic Kingdom is the access to the castle. Being able to walk through the castle with an interactive experience was a highlight. "
1121,5.0,Nov 2016,"Success, Australia ",The best Disney in Asia,"They came, they saw and Disney did it. The most advanced rides in any Disney resort. Tron and Pirates of the Caribbean are the true standouts. The food is good for Disney and well priced and the merchandise a dream. Downtown Disney has huge variety and shopping. I can't wait to go back!"
1122,4.0,Dec 2016,Melbourne ,Enjoyful,"Spent 2 full days in the park, probably should add an extra day in order to enjoy all attractions. The queue to most rides and attractions on average 30mins to 2 hours and that was on weekdays. All shows all in Chinese Mandarin, bit hard to enjoy if you can't understand it. Most visitors are local tourists probably from other cities. The park is huge, probably 4 times larger than the one in Hongkong. With so big crowd, getting through the entry gate can take a while, as the security check is very strict, bags search, metal detectors, etc. However it was a surprise that restaurants are not very busy. Perhaps because outside food and drinks are allowed in, lots of people bring their own food. The parade and Light show (fireworks) are the highlight. But most stage shows also enjoyful thats if you can understand Mandarin. Overall is great fun for young kids. "
1123,3.0,Jan 2017,"Perth, Australia ",Get the PhotoPass!,"Bought tickets online for 2 days - Thursday 12 Jan and Friday 13 Jan - thinking we would be avoiding the huge weekend crowds. Wrong :(Despite all our pre-planning and early wake ups, we reached Adventure Isle service counters at about 10am. Fastpasses for Soaring were all out by then. The crowds were even bigger on Friday. We reached the first queue (security checks) at 8.30am. After long waits there and entrance, we reached Adventure Isle at 10am again. No luck. We managed to experience most of the fun, non-kiddy rides except for Soaring and Seven Dwarfs. Lines were consistently too long. We watched a couple of shows too. My top picks:1. The spectacular light show in the evening. Not to be missed! The mix of fireworks, music and modern tech wizardry was pure magic. 2. Tron. Exhilarating and super cool ride.3. Pirates. Beautiful imageries. 4. Tarzan. Wonderful production that didn't need mastery of mandarin language. Haha. 5. Parade. Always nice to view our favourite Disney characters in their party mode. Kids pointed out some missing characters though. 6. Captain Jack. Another good production but marred by our dismal language skills. The Disney app was necessary to monitor wait times, find restaurants and toilets. The distances between rides are so vast and the queues so long that we got fatigued quite early on. One of the innovations at Shanghai Disneyland was the PhotoPass. We purchased a card for 369yuan after our first ride. The staff scans the card when you select your pictures from rides. Pics get uploaded into a PhotoPass phone app linked to your card. Some of the pictures will come with the ride names. You can then download into your phone. You can use PhotoPass over 3 days and photos are kept for 1 month. We used PhotoPass at all character meetups. We even got pictures taken by official photographers dotted around the castle and Mickey Avenue. Some of the photos were imprinted with Disneyland logo. Brilliant!Oh, another thing...when you first enter the park ensure you note down the name of the ticket owner. The staff has photos of persons tagged to each ticket. You can't re-enter with another person's ticket, which was annoying when we got stuck at the Disneyland entrance on our second day. We were split up due to unforeseen circumstances but had taken the precaution to hand out tickets to everyone in the family. Fortunately it was just a slight delay. "
1124,4.0,Oct 2016,"Shanghai Region, China ",Even during the week and under rain it's packed!,"It was a rainy Wednesday during the Autumn and I was not expecting to find the park any crowded. Of course I could do everything I planned, but I took lines and some long queues to do it! Anyway, always a magical experience! :)"
1125,4.0,Sep 2016,"Cape Town Central, South Africa ",Fun filled day,"I was super excited for Shanghai Disneyland as I've been to the Orlando Disneyworld and thoroughly enjoyed it. Prior to going i researched the park and noticed a lot of people had the same concerns as me i.e. ride queues, food prices, rowdiness of the crowds etc. here's my experience and tips below and I hope it helps those of you wanting to visit Shanghai Disneyland!-We chose to visit the park on a weekday as we assumed it would be quieter.. it was still busy with foreigners however still bearable.-We took a train from Tsim tsa Tsui changed once and it was straight to disneyland station from there on (45min journey), Ive unfortunately forgotten the exact train lines to take. However the map of the train routes are extremely useful and should be used from the beginning.-Tickets were purchased at the park using their credit card facilities.We reached the park just after opening i.e. 9am. The ticket queue was non-existent and was a quick process.-The park allows sealed/packaged food and drinks to be brought in. Seeing that always food in theme parks are expensive we purchased snacks/drinks from a small grocery store in the Disneyland train station.-My plan was to enter the park and get fastpasses for the busiest rides. However upon entering the park was quiet and we started with Tron which is the most popular ride at the park. We stood in line for approx 10min. The ride was a blast and a must do!.-We then followed the map and proceeded to do the rest of the rides. It seemed to get much busier by midday and queues began to take longer. After realizing waiting times where increasing I ran to get some fast passes for Soaring over the Horizons and Roaring rapids however they were finished already, this was at 3pm. We ended up queuing regardless. The longest we waiting was for Soaring over the horizons (1hr 30min), but was definitely worth it in the end. An amazing ride.-We did all the rides we intended to do in a day, the only thing we didn't get to do was stroll through the castle and Alices maze.Overall it was extremely enjoyable day. That being said it still lacks the enthusiasm of the 'Disney' spirit. Staff need to be friendlier, spirited and more helpful. Rides were very good. Some queues were long but manageable. To do it in a day is slightly rushed and tiring, I would recommend 2 days to do everything at leisure. I ignored my advice but fastpasses are a must! its advisable to first get fastpasses for roaring rapids and soaring over the horizons which are situated at one end of the park. Then begin the rides at tron and when its your allocated fast pass time get those rides done. Another thing I would like to stress, if you are not staying at disneyland hotel and need to get back using the train, at closing time there are THOUSANDS of people needing to get back using the same train, the train is smaller than usual and does not arrive as often. It can get extremely chaotic. We left just before the light show finished and ran to the train.I do apologise for the lengthy review, but if you like me im sure you would like to be prepared. Whoever is visiting the park, enjoy!! "
1126,4.0,Jan 2017,"Mount Hawthorn, Australia ",Disney fun,"Hot tip - go early and buy a FAST PASS.  We had the day at Disney today.  A beautiful clean and friendly fun park, but lines very long.  We arrived too late to buy a FAST PASS, so spent a lot of our time in queues.  We queued for the pirate show thinking it would be in English for some reason, but not the case, all in Chinese, so didn't enjoy as much as we would have if we understood their humour.  Lots of laughter from the crowd.  All in all a great day.  We took the Metro which was very easy and very cheap. "
1127,4.0,Jan 2017,N/A,Still need more ride to match tokyo disneyland,"Currently tron is the main attraction but to match tokyo disneyland still need some improvement, there are some works going on at the moment so we'll see in a year time.  The toy story hotel is definitely a new interesting alternative to stay at disney hotel."
1128,3.0,Jan 2017,china ,Glad it's here in China...but not up to Disney standards,"We did enjoy it quite a bit. The Tron rollercoaster is one of the best I've been on. However, in some ways it was quite frustrating and seemed to be influenced by something we run into quite often in China...apathy toward the customer:1) The Soaring attraction's fast pass machine was broken. It has been for the past few days and they have no timetable for its repair. As a result, the line was 2.5 hours long (on a January, cold, rainy-forecast, weekday) and there was no way to expedite it. Even with the 2-day pass we never considered waiting that long. Disappointing.2) Pirates of the Caribbean ride was broken and re-opened a few times during the day. Again, no solid information of when it could be opened.3) The ropes course had  40 minute wait. Not too bad, but then most of the more enjoyable paths were closed without any explanation. Ended up being very boring and a waste of time.4) In China, people smoke everywhere and are accustomed to not following any rules. Overall, Disney did a good job of cracking down on this, but we still encountered smokers  at least once an hour in areas where it was not permitted.5) In China people tend to cut in line, but Disney had done a really good job of preventing this. However, you'll still get pushed alot. Just frustrating.The Disney app was wonderful, glad to have that. Cheesecake factory was surpurb, so thankful to have that in China.Overall, we'd go again, but hope Disney HQ can notice these flaws and bring things back up to Disney high-quality standards."

1131,3.0,Dec 2016,"Sydney, Australia ",Where is the Disneyland Spirit?,"We were a group of 6 friends between 20-30s visiting Shanghai Disneyland for the first time. Some of us have been to Disneyland and Disney Sea in Japan so our expectations of our experience of the Shanghai experience would very much be the same with the added option of a brand new Disneyland. Unfortunately, we did not feel that it was the happiest place on earth. While it was true it had less people than Japan it didn't have the happiness and spirit of Disneyland from the people that worked there. Tron ride was amazing and we went through quickly with no issues but the rest was sad that we had to wait a long time and also fast track didn't really work properly especially being told that it ran out at 10am only 1hr after the theme park opened.What disappointed me the most was there were scalpers inside the park selling fast track tickets.....There wasn't a lot of options to purchase Disney famous popcorn or Disney hats etc..Food offerings were sad and not exciting and even the famous Turkey leg was a let down.So great for new rides but the rest..."
1132,5.0,Jan 2017,"Sydney, Australia ",Much less crowded than Tokyo Disneyland,"We had a great day at Shanghai Disneyland and were pleasantly surprised by the short wait times for rides. We went on a grey weekday in January so definitely not a peak day but we had been to Tokyo Disneyland at a similar time of year  but it was very,very busy. The Captain Jack Sparrow Stunt Spectacular is worth watching (even if you don't speak Mandarin) and the Pirates of the Caribbean ride was great. The Disneyland app gives real time wait times and fast pass return times so is a huge help. Be sure to take a portable charger though as electric outlets are hard to find (some covered power points are in the seating areas of some cafes and shops). If you lose your ticket (as I did) go straight to the Guest Services at the entrance with the other tickets you purchased and they will replace it. For restaurants, Disneytown has cheaper and better food options. we also should have hired a pram as our almost four year old feel asleep just before the final show and we had to carry him."

Staff members incredibly helpful, some speak English but if they don't they will try and found somebody who does. Thank you for that. Future world - cannot remember the name exactly is the thing to do first definitely - futuristic roller coaster yay. Download the Disney app, a BIG help. Have fun!!!"
1134,4.0,Dec 2016,"Shanghai, China ",Missing the Disney Magic but still worth the visit,"I worked at Anaheim Disneyland in uni and I remember being told in training that being a cast member is all about the show.   Regardless of a repeat visitor or first time visitor, it's all about truly making the day a magical experience for everyone you come in contact with.   While the park and attractions definitely have the Disney touch, the staff simply doesn't seem to get it.  By no means are they rude or mean or unfriendly, but, it is obvious that some of them could care less to be there.  It just seemed very ""China"" for those of you reading, you know what I mean.   Chinese crowds are also interesting and if you are not used to them, then that in it of itself can be adventurous.    There are loud speakers before 9am telling people not to run and, of course, once 9am hits and the rope drops, people are running like mad towards their chosen rides.  It actually can be dangerous.  We had 3 young children with us and really needed to hold onto their hands during that initial rush.   For regular Disney goers, you really only need to go to Tron, Pirates and stay for the fireworks.   We didn't go on everything simply due to lack of interest.  It was actually a quiet day and the lines were not so bad but our kids just weren't interested in some of the rides.   We understand enough Mandarin Chinese so we did go see Frozen and the Pirates show.   It was nice and the kids were engaged but if you don't understand Mandarin I would say skip the shows.  The food---big disappointment!  When we go to Anaheim Disney, we actually plan out what we want to eat because the food is so good.   Here in Shanghai, the food options are completely lackluster and insanely expensive.  They do have the turkey legs but it can be up to an hour long wait and you pay 90rmb which is about 15USD.    Save your stomach and go eat at Disney Town--cheesecake factory or one of the other many western or asian options.   Overall the park is beautiful and it was a fun day to walk around and hit a few rides.   It's worth a visit but definitely not on a crowded day.   One tip is the Disney photo pass--I think this is done very well here in Shanghai.    You download the app and then you get a photo pass card from one of the park photographers--just take a photo with a character, after one of the rides or near a castle and the photographer hands you a card.   Keep this card and each time you take a photo, the photographer scans the card.   Your pictures will then appear on your app.   Now they are blurry and you can't see them well but you can buy all your photos at the end of the day for 350RMB which is about 50USD.   Now these are professional photos and you can easily get hundreds of great photos! Some have fun borders and also animation.   It's convenient and easy and not too expensive.  Better than having to take out your mobile phone each time or find a stranger to take a photo so you can be in the shot.  Key to remember though is that you can only scan 3 photo pass cards as part of the 350rmb whole package deal.  So don't keep collecting a photo pass each time.  Keep one or two and scan those ones only.  We made the mistake of getting a bunch of photo pass cards so I could only choose 3 of them that I wanted.   Even with those three we had over 100 pictures.   I thought that was the best deal of all on our entire Disney trip. The pictures from Tron are the best."
1135,3.0,Dec 2016,Beau Bassin - Rose Hill ,"Good if you want to feel some Disney magic but otherwise, brace yourself before going there",Few points to be noted from my visit in Disneyland Shanghai:It is certainly NOT a place where foreigner not familiar with the Mandarin would be comfortable. All rides are narrated in Chinese. Only the ending show had bits of English (and they came out during songs);Waiting time for most rides are way too long. A one hour wait for a 10 minutes attraction? Seriously?Place to be avoided in winter! Many rides are closed plus the cold will eventually take a toll on you at some point! Make sure to leave the place before everyone decides to do so else you will have trouble walking since it will be so packed .. and Chinese people are known for having .. err .. questionable manners as they would probably walk over you if they could.
1136,5.0,Jan 2017,"Springfield, MO ",Definitely up to the Disney standard!,"We enjoyed a great visit on a cold, rainy day -- no lines or crowds! The park is beautifully constructed and perfectly maintained -- everything you'd expect from Disney. The rides are great; you can tell they're brand new -- especially the stunning Pirates of the Caribbean and futuristic Tron coaster. My takeaway: don't be scared away by bad weather -- we felt like we got several days' worth of Disneyland in exchange for braving the cold/dampness. "
1137,4.0,Dec 2016,"Bangkok, Thailand ",Disney in Shanghai mmmk,"We went on a rather cold and rainy day, but it was fun anyway. I enjoy visiting different Disneyland and was so happy that this one was decorated for Christmas time. It is of course smaller, but did not feel lacking in any way. I enjoyed Tomorrowland so much, it was a blast. Pirates was cool, but not as cool as California ;) No haunted mansion :( so so sad. I enjoyed the DisneyTown connected to the park so you could walk out and have some food and drinks and then come back in. Easy in and out process. Only thing, mostly all the audio was in Chinese, no English in there. You can tell they did not want to include that aspect. And obviously I am in China sooooo...But Disneyland always has different languages. Come on peeps. :/ The castle is cool, but you have to wait in line haha, it should just be a walk through thing....line not necessary. But all in all, it was fun and I enjoyed it. Fireworks at night is magical :)"
1138,4.0,Jan 2017,N/A,Good but not the best disneyland,"We went in the winter on a weekday and the place was practically deserted. Have a look at our pictures to see. We walked on to nearly all the rides with 5 min waits. If you have been to Disneyland in other countries you will find this one physically big but with a small number of rides. We had done all of them by lunch time, and repeated some of the better ones in the afternoon.So a few things: 1. Be there before 9am for the rope drop. Everyone will run dangerously towards the nearest ride they want, but you don't need to, just walk to whatever you want to see first and it will only be a 5 min wait. Then walk to the next ride that is also a 5 min wait, and then go start to get the fast passes.2. Everything is in Chinese. Some of the staff try to speak a little English, but it's all in Chinese. This includes all the rides. There are no subtitles or translations to English. This is not a theme park for English speaking tourists.3. The rides are short. Think 30 seconds for the roller coasters, so be aware of that if the queue is over an hour long.4. The shops in Disney town are just random shops. If you are looking for Disney themed shops you need to go to the Disney world shop. Otherwise it's just like mall shops.5. Disney town has western restaurants, think Cheesecake Factory.Overall it is worth a visit if you like Disney parks. But don't expect too much. Your going to be annoyed by obnoxious Chinese people pushing and cutting. We were lucky it was quiet when we were there, I imagine it would be awful if it was peak season and busy.One final note: they had massive facilities for HUGE queues, so this place will be horrendous in the summer, seriously go in the winter if you can."
1139,5.0,Jan 2017,Canberra ,We had a fantastic time,"The park was very well built and very well run. We spent 2 days there just after the new year public holidays so the park was not crowded at all. There was virtually no queue so we managed to do all the rides in one day. We took a taxi from shanghai which costed around 120 yuan ($25 AUD), subway no.11 also has a stop right at the park entrance. There are plenty of taxi available at the park as well. The park is gorgeous and spotlessly clean everywhere, including the toilets. Food was outrageously expansive in the park. There is a restaurant called ""xin wang"" in the middle of the disney town offers the best value and pretty authentic chinese meals. Rides and shows were all excellent. Overall the park is just as good as all other disneys we visited if not better. "
1140,4.0,Nov 2016,"Singapore, Singapore ",Very good outing,"I was in Shanghai for a week with my spouse and 6 year old son. I brought my son to Shanghai Disneyland. We took a cab from our hotel in Hong Qiao and took slightly more than an hour to reach Disneyland. The traffic at around 10am in the morning was not too bad.The entrance is a very long walk away from the taxi drop off point. Overall the bike is extremely huge. During my time there (on a weekday), the park is not crowded at all. My son is quite scared of the rides, so we mostly do very kiddy stuff or just enjoy the atmosphere.This is my first Disneyland. I had previously been to Disney Sea in Japan. Overall, I find the park to be very new and the staff very well helpful and friendly. As the park is not crowded that day, the staff to guest ratio is very high, so the staff seems very attentive. Although there is a lot of walking between attractions, the spaciousness makes the visit very enjoyable. Will certainly recommend a visit if one is in Shanghai with young children."
1141,5.0,Dec 2016,"Tokyo, Japan ",Had a lovely visit to Shanghai Disney Resort,"My dughter lives in Shanghai, and knows I am a Disney fan, so when we visited her she bought us tickets to the park.  It is a world class Disney park. They have figured out the Chinese culture as far as public cleanliness habits and challenges waiting in line, and have everything well managed. The bathrooms are spotless, and have warm water, soap and hot dryers.  The attractions are different and unusual (conpared to Tokyo Disney - which I am familiar with since I live in Tokyo)  My daughter thinkgs it is to be senitive to the current political issues.  For example, there is no haunted mansion.  The TRON ride is the most popular but the lines were over 3 hours and the fast passes were gone.  We enjoyed the Pirates of the Carribean ride, which is much different than the others parks we have been to.  Very multi media and exciting.  We didn't eat at the restaurants, since we wanted to see the entire park, and it is pretty big.  WE had carmel corn from a kiosk which was deliciious.  Also a tea smoked duck leg and some chinese beef wraps.  The castle is beautiful, and they have added central asian architectual features.  It seems so big when you are in the park!  Also, Mulan is a big feature at this park. She is in the parade riding her horse, and it is very cool in a stylized chinese way. There are many restaurants in DisneyTown which is technically part of the park , but serves alcohol. Think California Pizza kitchen and Wolfgang Puck.  Very surreal.  It was interesting comparing features with the other Disney parks. There were very few other foreign tourists, so we did attract attention, but everyone was very friendly and polite.   If you are a Disney fan, don't miss this park!"

1144,5.0,Dec 2016,"London, England, United Kingdom ",Fantastic resort its a must!,"The Shanghai Disney Resort is a fantastic and should be on your itinerary if in Shanghai.  The resort is brand new which usually means it's short on attractions HOWEVER this resort boosts some of the finest available in Pirates of the Caribbean, Tron, 7 Dwarfs Mine train and Camp Discovery Challenge trials and promises to only get bigger in the coming years.  Alongside this the park offers many opportunities to meet characters and enjoy fantastic shows and parades.  As with all Disney Parks the night time spectacular is a stand out feature.The park and surrounding area is beautifully landscaped and designed to emerge you into the distinct theme of each area.  Its also extremely easy to access using Shanghais subway/ metro system - I'd recommend staying off site as Shanghai is a fantastic city to see.  When I visited the park was not busy at all however facilities like FastPass are offered to ensure you are able to get on major attractions.  Cast members are extremely helpful (able to support in English or find someone who can communicate with you).I cannot recommend the park highly enough it really is a unique experience and one that justifies the visa cost for entering China.  GO VISIT!!"
1145,4.0,Dec 2016,"London, UK ",Great family day out,It's the Disney experience in Shanghai including some great customer service. Avoid weekend and holidays otherwise it is packed and the queues go beyond 120 minutes. Plenty of new and exciting rides for all ages and easy to get to on the metro or by taxi. The app is helpful to see what the wait times are like and you can also buy your tickets directly with it.
1146,4.0,Dec 2016,"Singapore, Singapore ",Disneyland Shanghai (Good part),"Here are some of the pros about Disneyland Shanghai in my perspective.Having been to all the Disneyland/world, this was the newest park that opened this year.1) The park is really big, I suppose it has to, as it is to cater for the crowd.2) With the numerous feedbacks online, the place is now very clean (Disneyland standard!)3) This disney offer some unique rides. Here are the reviews for those rides with Fast passes only. a) Tron - Pretty cool ride. Imagine riding a motor bike at high speed. No bags, so do put them in the lockers next to the ride. b) Seven dwarf mine train- Somewhat similar to big thunder mountain railc) Buzz light year - different settings from LA/HKG/Orlandod) Soarin over the horizon - Simliar to the new Orlando ride (Soarin across the world sights, instead of US, in California Adventures)e&f) Peter Pan and Pooh rides are similar to the rest of the Disney. Unless you like them, not worth the fast pass. g) It was winter, so Roaring Rapids was close for maintenance.Advise:1) Go during off peak and non school holidays (Tickets are cheaper and queue are shorter for food and ride).2) They are pretty strict on heights, so do ensure your children are above the height limits.3) Go early to the park if possible. Fast Passes typically would finish by early noon.4) The shows are interesting and worth watching. However, do note that they are performed in Mandarin/Chinese. Even ""Frozen singalong"", is in Chinese version.  5) Must take the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" ride. Totally different from California disneyland."
1147,5.0,Nov 2016,"Dubrovnik, Croatia ",Playtime!!!,"I will own up to being a Disney fan and visiting because of my love of all things Disney - was I disappointed?  No.  Definitely not.  I have been to every other Disney theme park in the world and this new park featured high on my agenda for 2016 when I first thought I would be going earlier in the year before the opening was delayed.   Was I disappointed - as I said, no.  The Disney ethos was here - the clean park with fun rides that keeps young and old amused for the day.  I purchased a two day ticket but you don't save any money.  For those that have been to another disney park the design is similar following the format of a Main Street with lands going off to the left and right and with the castle in the middle, it's like going back to an old friend.  Some of the rides were the same but a few were new.  In particular the Pirates of the Caribean was probably the best ride I have been on - full size pirate ships above the sea and below to mention but one thing.  We had dinner in the castle where, apart from very good food, Micky, Minnie, Donald and Daisy entertained us with no limit on the time they spent at each table with the diners.  I particularily liked the way they had so much time for their very little fans.   There were one or two other rided very specific to this Disneyand that were just as good, I will being going again!We were unlucky enough to go there on the day a monsoon hit Shanghai and quite expected things to be shut - not so, every ride was still operating and the staff remained happy and considerate even in these conditions, once you decided you were just going to get wet you went on and enjoyed yourself."
1148,4.0,Dec 2016,"Singapore, Singapore ",Unexpected Wonderful Surprise ,"Read poor reviews of the place so decided to go there with an open mind of not expecting much of the place.. but was pleasantly surprise with how SUPER CLEAN, orderly things are being done at Shanghai Disneyland contrary to what have been reported and seen on YouTube. The staff are helpful & friendly. Ever so happy to help snap picture of you.  They will assist you to find someone who could understand English if they don't understand what you've asked. Didn't encounter any uncouth, spitting, loud, unruly behavior, shoving the people are famous for. During the parade, the locals make way for my boy to be at the front so he could see and enjoy the show. Q for the rides were super long but in orderly fashion. My teenage daughter went for the special 1 rider Q and was quite fast. Toilets are dry and CLEAN. There's one HALAL stall at Disneytown @Food Republic - Yershari Rstn which was never highlighted offering 2 diff kind of fried rice, sate & soup. taste was descent. Surprisingly there's a stall offering Malay Nasi Padang but no halal sign. Overall will give Shanghai DISNEYLAND a thumb up. Go & experience for yourself to believe the happy place in Shanghai. Spent 3 days at the park which is quite big to explore for a day. Surprisingly CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN Place.."
1149,4.0,Dec 2016,"Brisbane, Queensland, Australia ",A somewhat different but exciting Disneyland experience,"We visited in early December and despite being in our 20s had a great time. Don't go in expecting the standard Disneyland experience - Shanghai Disneyland has its own unique feel which I think is a positive for the park. The rides in the park are effectively 'reimagined' versions of the rides you see in other Disneylands, and take advantage of newer technology to deliver a more immersive and realistic experience. For example, Space Mountain has been reimagined into the Tron Lightcoaster ride, which launches you into a dark room (much like the Rock n Roller Coaster in LA) full of drops, turns, etc. and amazing special effects. Similarly, the Pirates of the Carribean ride is a new take of the original in the USA, using floor-to-ceiling wall projections and other effects to create better immersion.Having visited in the middle of the week we did not queue for much longer then 10 minutes on each ride. The only drawbacks to the experience were occasionally unfriendly staff and the expensive yet subpar food (although this seems to be true for every theme park in the world)."

1153,2.0,Dec 2016,"Beijing, China, ",Not Magical!,"Everything about Disney in Anaheim and especially Orlando is delightfully magical. Hong Kong is pretty decent, but Shanghai Disney doesn’t measure up in any aspect. The most significant aspect that makes Shanghai not magical is the unfriendly staff. They are ridiculously friendly in Orlando but here, you’re treated like a nothing and that didn’t make for a magical and unforgettable experience.ProsIt’s different and unique with newer rides not available in other Disney parks.It’s clean and new.Transportation to Shanghai Disney is very convenient with subway line 11.It’s relatively inexpensiveConsRude and unfriendly staff (there are exceptions).The food is not good at all.People are smoking everywhere.People are always cutting lines and pushing in line (more so than anywhere else)Not enough rides.Everything is in Chinese (although it is in China)Fast Pass and app is very inefficient (why can’t they use the same system as in Orlando?)TipsDon’t travel from America or another distant land just to visit Shanghai Disney. (If you’re already here in China, and you want to be frustrated, then be my guest (pun intended))Arrive an hour early to beat the long security check lines and they even let you in a little before the scheduled opening time.Head straight for the fast pass for Soaring and go on Tron, Buzz Lightyear, Pirates and 7 Dwarfs before 10am (It’s possible even on a crowded day) and then you can relax and walk around and not worry about the long lines.Watch the Tarzan show even though it is in Chinese as you will undoubtedly understand the plot as it is Tarzan.Avoid weekends and holidays (are you crazy!)Weekdays are much smoother and cheaper, although my cons still apply for weekdays.Know that you will be uncomfortable by the rude behavior of the people and even the staff. If you go with that mind set, the inconveniences will be that much more tolerable."
1154,3.0,Dec 2016,"Melbourne, Australia ",Expensive day out!,"After paying the fairly pricey admission fee, it was disappointing to find a number of the key attractions closed on the day we went. Those that were open had queues of up to 120 minutes so your patience will be tested! Lunch for 3 of burgers, chicken and drinks cost almost $80 AUD and even though other reviewers have said you can take your own food, security guards confiscated everything but water at the bag checks. A highlight was the Tarzan show which showcased amazing Chinese acrobatics in a fast paced and visually spectacular performance. One of those must sees in Shanghai but we left feeling that more attention was placed on food and shopping outlets than rides."
1155,2.0,Dec 2016,"Singapore, Singapore","Excellent Rides, Poor Experience","We have only visited Disneyland in the U.S., and Shanghai Disneyland was our second as a family. Expecting a magical experience like in our previous visits, we were filled with excitement, and were initially impressed with the relatively spacious compound, impressive castle and an app that helps plan your route and queue times. We expected long queues like any other tourist spots in China, and there are certainly rides well worth the long wait. Tron was excellent, my son did it twice. Pirates of the Caribbean was also good.The queue times on the app (and at the ride entrance) were excessively under-reported. We ran for Soaring Over The Horizon, one of the most popular rides here for a 20-min queue as told by the app, and only to be in the queue for almost an hour. There were litter all along the queue, and the Disney staff seemed oblivion to them. By the end of the ride, the app updates that the queue now takes 30 mins (BS). Another fast pass queue reported 5 min wait, turned out to be 20 min wait.One of the magical experience of Disneyland for young children is the parade. The Shanghai Disneyland parade was little more than just a procession of floats. No marching band, no interaction with the crowd. The Disney staff were less spontaneous about engaging the crowd, than to stop people from crossing the invisible lines.The food was terrible. We ordered hot chocolate on the menu, but were given Ovaltine instant mix pack. We love Chinese food, but the rice tasted like it was frozen and microwaved. Hello, Disney?? Rude crowds keep squeezing their way in front of you, while waiting for the fireworks. Only to realize there was no fireworks during our visit, with no reasons given leaving everyone going home disappointed. We will likely visit other Disneyland in Paris, Tokyo and/or Hong Kong but will most certainly give Shanghai Disneyland a miss."

This is an excellent addition, though I feel it does lack that certain ""Disney Magic"". It might be cultural, but something seemed missing. That said, I still recommend a visit. Some excellent unique attractions, like Tron; a fantastic new take on the Pirates of the Caribbean; and the absolutely best version of Peter Pan's Flight I have ever seen. Staff members speak passable English, those that don't, will help find someone who does.Try to avoid busy times. The crowds can be bad and the Chinese can be pushy (anyone travelling in China will know this already), which leads to anger and aggregation for a Westerner. I went on a weekday in December and the crowds were very manageable. "

Rides are superb although you should get a fast pass if you wanna get to ride everything cause there are A LOT of people, mostly Chinese locals. The park itself is very big. There's a parade and show at the castle every now and then so it's not gonna be boring if you're not really planning to make most out of the rides. Roller coaster is supposedly one of the fastest ever. Best to go in Spring cause the area where it is in could get very cold and windy during winter. 40 mins away from Nanjing Road. "

We waited 90 minutes in line for a 1 minute ride on the jet packs and when I saw that all the other rides were the same or longer wait, my wife and I were like ""nope""  They really should just allow you to book time slots on the rides, the fast pass may help somewhat but you'll still have to wait. Overall Disney is really amazing, it's ridiculously expensive for things like food and snacks and souvenirs and there is too much to do all in one day unless you can run a marathon the whole day. I also bought the photopass+ to utilize the photographers on site, but had the worst experience ever. The PhotoPass wasn't activated for about 6 hours and the photos we did take were either terrible or didn't show up on the app or ever. It was ¥369 I can never get back.

The food in the village outside the park was overpriced but some pleasant surprises Cheesecake Factory (forget about your diet), Wolfgang Puck's (Try the California Styled Pizzas), Element Fresh (try the Cobb Salad). I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this Park and especially the enthusiasm of the staff. I stayed for a while at the Toy Story Hotel (maybe not the best choice on a business trip) but the enthusiasm was infectious. Great and easy to figure out busses that run to the hotels and metro stations. I must say... well done...! You need the whole day to enjoy this park, especially with children."
1173,4.0,Dec 2016,"Manila, Philippines ",1st Disneyland Experience,"This has been my 1st time to any Disneyland theme park. We had been anticipating it days before. I had read so many negative reports regarding the park's cleanliness issue and the unruly people pissing somewhere ""convenient"". However, surprisingly, the park is clean. People are smoking only on designated areas. I never saw one taking their ""CR break"" anywhere. Their staff are always picking up every piece of trash, even just a piece of leaf that had just fallen off a branch. It's not as big as what I've expected but it sure was tiring to roam around the whole day. But even if it was just my 1st time on a Disneyland theme park, being a Disney fan I would say the magical feeling when I set foot there is quite lacking. The architecture sure is marvelous as well as the castle especially at night with the help of the lighting and Christmas decors but I can't help but feel like the magic is absent. Despite this, the TRON ride was exhilirating. The interiors are so futuristic. We were also looking forward to the Pirates of the Caribbean ride but unfortunately for us it was temporarily closed as well as the Roaring Rapids. The highlight for me would be the fireworks. Somehow I felt like the magic that was missing kind of compensated by the fireworks show. During winter, they close at 7 pm. I hope they close at a later time though. Nevertheless, we will back for sure. We are actually contemplating on purchasing their Sunday seasonal pass for 825 RMB valid until March 31st. Imagine being there every Sunday :)"

1175,5.0,Dec 2016,"Schwieberdingen, Germany ",Worth every penny! ,"I had previously read some bad reviews about Shanghai Disneyland and was skeptical when I decided to go there. Some people said staff was rude, didn't smile at all and didn't speak English. I don't know if I was lucky, but I had a great experience there. Staff was very friendly with me and my friend whenever we needed help finding some places and whenever they could not speak English, they smiled and called another staff. The park was surprisingly clean and I did not see people throwing rubbish on the ground or smoking there, apart from the smoking areas. Getting a ticket at the park was pretty easy and there was not many people on that Saturday. Also getting a fast pass wasn't difficult at all and took us not more than 5 mins in the queue. Just as an advice, I'd recommend you taking the ""single ride"" queues wherever available, as there are very few people in these queues, even less than in the fast pass ones. The only thing is that you won't sit beside your friend or family, as you will be filling ""empty spaces"" in the rides. I'd strongly recommend going in the Tron ride. This is the only park that has this ride. It goes super fast but it is not that scary as it seems to be from outside. Dining or even snacks there can be pretty expensive if you are on a budget, so you'd better bring a sandwich in your bag. Otherwise, there are several restaurants in the park and outside such as Cheesecake Factory, Blue Frog, etc in the Disneytown. You can go outside and go back inside with your ticket with no problem. The earlier you go, the better it is. Stay for the eve fireworks show, but leave a bit earlier to get the subway, as the whole crowd will rush there after the show. "
1176,4.0,Dec 2016,"Singapore, Singapore ",It's wonderland ,I've been there when it's pre grand opening . Not that crowded and clean. Comparing to Hong Kong Disney is better and more fun regardless of park size and activities. Maybe it's brand new.
1177,5.0,Nov 2016,"Basingstoke, UK ",Great Day At Disney!,"I had read a few bad comments about Shanghai Disneyland so when we went I expected to be disappointed .  We arrived early, before the park opened.  I purchased the tickets online which definitely saved time with queuing.  It was mid week on a Wednesday and the weather forecast was cloudy with possible showers (most Chinese do not like the rain so a rainy day is a good day to go.  Also most won't take the children out of school so term time is also a good time).  Metro was easy, line 11 directly there.  We had time to get a Starbucks coffee and muffin in Disney town just to the left of the entrance gate.  Once the park was opened we headed straight for the Tron ride which was not disappointing.  There were no queues so we went on it twice.  The frozen show was good and although it was in Chinese it was easy to follow what was happening.  The Tarzan show was great, super acrobatics.  I have to say the audience although visibly enjoyed the show, didn't give much of an applause so if you go give the performers a big round of applause because they really are fantastic.  I really can't find anything bad to say about the place..toilets were clean, no litter, friendly staff...i think our Mickey ears showed the staff we had entered into the spirit so we got lots of waves and smiles.  I think previous bad reviews may have been just to the huge numbers when it first opened and the usual teething problems of any new attraction.  If you like Disney (I've been to Disney in Florida, LA and Paris) and you go with some fun friends and family then you will love it!  I'd definitely go again the next time I am in Shanghai. Ps download the Disney App as its brilliant for getting around the park."
1178,4.0,Dec 2016,Shanghai ,Much better than expected,"We read so much negative press about Shanghai Disney we didn't have particularly high expectations, and were pleasantly surprised. It was a chilly December Thursday and remarkably it really wasn't very busy. We didn't wait for more than 30 minutes for anything. The key to a successful day is to plan before you go and take advantage of the fast passes and their stupidly complicated rules. A few other observations:- The food is both expensive and poor.- Some of the more ""chatty"" attractions are difficult to understand if you don't speak Chinese.- The park is much smaller than we expected. In a way it was a bit of a disappointment as we lapped the whole park probably 3 times during the day.- If you wan't to get souvenirs from the shops do not wait until after the Show in the evening. It felt like we were fighting with the entire population of China in the shops at that time. During the day the shops are very quiet.- Bags are an issue. The attractions that don't allow bags don't have secure storage where you board the ride, instead they have storage lockers outside before you even enter the queuing area. Quite simple there aren't enough lockers and the line (more of a scrum) for the lockers was much longer than the actual line for the rides. And this was a quiet day!All in all it was an enjoyable day. It doesn't have quite the same magical feel to it as the parks in the U.S, or even Paris, but with low expectations we had a good time."
1179,5.0,Dec 2016,N/A,"Was not disappointed, very impressed","We went on a very cold Wednesday, it was about 5-6 degrees with constant cold wind throughout the day. And to our surprise there're weren't much people at the park that day. So the weather and the temperature is the key to the crowd in the park. We only took 2 fast passes, one for Soaring Over The Horizon and Tron, we started with Pirates of The Caribbean as it had a 15 minute wait, all of the rides that day were within 20-40 minutes and that includes Mine Train as well, we waited for 30 minutes without a fast pass for that ride. However, Soaring Over The Horizon had a 60 minute wait so we got a fast pass first thing when we got in the park, however, we couldn't see what the fuss was about, it was just a 3 minute long widescreen show of famous places in the world. In my opinion, I don't recommend people to wait for over an hour on a low crowd day(or at any day) for the ride. Totally not worth it. I downloaded the Disney Resort App beforehand and it helped me check all the wait times in the park. However, we wanted to go through the park anti-clockwise, so we kinda left Tron for the last. But it had a 10 minute wait all day! When it came to the time where we wanted to get on the Tron ride, it was closed down for refurbishment. And we only had 2 hours left for the day! That was a disappointment, but we went on other rides and I constantly kept myself updated on the ride in hopes of it opening up again. And after two rides, it opened up, with only 30 minutes till the fireworks. We were glad as there weren't much people still that time, and we got to ride it twice! One tiny problem that got us stuck for a while is that if you have a bag or any personal belongings that are unfit for the ride, you have to prepare yourself ¥1 coins for the lockers. If you don't have any like me and are only left with big ¥100 notes, you can easily change them at the Tron store behind the locker area. Don't go buying the lockers for 3 hours! Lastly, we didn't have fireworks, we had animation projected on the castle. It was amazing! If you've been to Osaka Castle in Japan, it is similar to the night show on the Osaka Castle, just less animated. Great overall and the castle was definitely extremely pretty, take more pictures of it as it is definitely breathtaking!(especially at night)"

The usual rides were at least a 60 minute wait and MINE TRAIN and TRON were much longer. Food was not that great compared to American Disneylands or Tokyo. They allow bringing in of sandwiches and other small food stuff so you might want to bring with a few just to keep you filled up during your visit.

This is the 4th Disney Park we have attended.  It has the best Pirates and Sleeping Beauty's Castle.  If I did have a criticism, it would be that they have not quite managed the crowd control issue yet.  It took forever to get through the security tables.  We also felt that Soaring Over the Horizon needs a little Disney Magic.  With a 110 minute wait, there is no variation to the interior of the facility.  Not even changing up the pattern of the brick blocks that the building is made of.  It was a long boring wait for a three minute ride.  Would never go through this again.  They were also out of Fast Passes for the day by 10:00 am so something was wonky there."

We picked a cloudy Sunday to visit and the park was not crowded at all, maximum average wait time was around 30 - 40 minutes. Tron was a very interesting ride and we wound up riding it 4 times during the day. Soaring over the horizon was the only ride we gave a miss as the wait times was always over 1 hour.The fastpass system works differently from Disney Japan, there are centralised locations for you to collect fastpasses, so they aren't right outside the ride, do remember to check your map before making a beeline for them.There is a Shanghai Disneyland App that shows live wait times and an interactive map (available in English) and you can buy your park tickets (at the moment, they only accept Alipay) via the App as well."

The park was clean, the staff very friendly and guests very respectful.I visited the park for two days in September, just a few months after its Grand Opening. I have previously visited Disneyland Paris and Walt Disney World in Orlando so I feel my opinion of Shanghai Disneyland is pretty accurate as I have very good grounds for comparison.Tron and Pirates of The Caribbean were excellent attractions, far superior in comparison to Space Mountain and POTC in other Disney Parks. Soarin' was also excellent and definitely worth a visit.The fastpass system is a little disorganised; I wouldn't bother personally unless a particular attraction has a mammoth queue.The food in Disneytown was far superior to that inside the park; I would recommend Wolfgang Puck and The Cheesecake Factory for sure.The shows and entertainment were good however, the fireworks not comparable to those in WDW or even Disneyland Paris.I think in a few years time, this park will be even better; there is definitely room for expansion and improvement.If WDW is a solid 10/10 and Disneyland Paris close behind on about 8.5/10 then I would give Shanghai Disneyland a 7/10.A must do for any Disney fan in China but don't go all the way to China just for this attraction!"
1188,3.0,Jun 2016,"Wroughton, UK ",New but not so great place ,"Compared to Euro Disney in Paris, this place still needs more development. To me the place was not ready and places were not on same level that in Paris - just because there is a benchmark.Missing proper roller coasters.Jack Sparrow was great though! But overall as an experience it was ok for a visit. "

1190,5.0,Dec 2016,"Gold Coast, Australia ",Family fun,"Great day out. Easy taxi ride from central Shanghai. Easy to buy tickets at the gate, limited English but very friendly and helpful. Be prepared to wait in lines up to 2hours. Sundays are peak days, even in overcast and rain. "
1191,5.0,Nov 2016,"Jakarta, Indonesia ",Great place to have fun,"You will need a whole day to explore this area, can access with  shanghai metro from the city, best season I thought for visiting on summer and autumn they have plenty outside adventureCheers"
1192,4.0,Nov 2016,"Waterford, Ireland ",Great buzz of activity,"It was quite crowded but the layout has very wide walking areas and lots of seating places to rest and watch what is going on. It is spotlessly clean, I found the staff helpful and when I was heading in to an event that had no english, I was advised of this at the entrance so I could decide what to do, which was helpful.  The queue times were long because it was a Saturday but that is the same the world over.Good selection of eating options throughout the park."
1193,4.0,Nov 2016,"Singapore, Singapore ",Nice place. Some very interesting ride. Awful and expensive food,"The place is really nice although the queue to buy the tickets is rather long. So it is best to purchase the ticket online and just walk to the turnstile on the day of your visit. Saves you a lot of time.The place is new so it's nice. It is rather big so 1 day may not be sufficient, especially if you go on a crowded day. You will need at least 1.5 days to cover most of the rides.You have to be prepared for long queues though. The queues for the more popular rides like Minetrain is rather long and the fastpass is very quickly fully redeemed. 7 dwarfs Mine train, Tron, Camp discovery, Soaring of the horizon, Pirate of the Caribbean, Roaring rapids were our favourites. Lilo and stitch was fun to sit through. Captain Jack Sparrow show at Treasure cove was good. Of all the rides, Minetrain was the longest. So, I would advise that you head straight for Fantasyland to either get the Fastpass or queue for the ride before the crowd comes in.There are quite a number of restaurants to choose from. We bought a 2 day pass and ate at 3 of them. I must say that the food is quite terrible and expensive. However, the restaurants are very pretty, so it kind of cancels out.Those of you who love to take selfies, do note that they do not allow selfie sticks to be used at the park.The fireworks was nice like all other Disneylands, although it was rather strange to hear all the Disney songs sung in Mandarin."
1194,5.0,Nov 2016,"Toronto, Canada ",Spectacular light show in a clean theme park.,"The experience in Disneytown, Lion King show and Disneyland was enjoyable although we had seen Lion King many times at different places. We did not have time to get to any ride because we enjoyed the shows and the leisurely stroll more. The evening fireworks and light show was more than spectacular. We ended up watching it from the terrace of Wolfgang Puck in Disneytown as well as in front of the castle in Disneyland. Hygiene was well maintained everywhere we went. It's puzzling to me that there was ""vendor"" selling counterfeit Minnie headdress among the people lining up for the show. Be prepared for the walk because the park is huge."
1195,4.0,Dec 2016,"Misawa, Japan ",Big Park with Room to Grow,"Shanghai was a great place to visit.  The park was very clean and the rides were as technologically advanced as could be imagined.  The Pirates ride was a huge step up from any other that I have experienced.  For roller coaster nuts, Tron was outstanding.    Soaring was also spectacular and the Castle is huge.  Don't ski the Alice maze.  It is surprisingly fun. The laser show on the castle with fireworks was great fun.  There are a lot of shows.  This is perhaps a cultural aspect that is different from the US.  The shows that I saw were excellent.   This park is huge.  You will walk your legs off.Disneytown is really great, especially for adults.  There was wonderful food a drinks.  Lots of different Chinese-style restaurants and even a Cheesecake Factory, Wolfgang Pucks, and Starbucks.  Make sure to hit the Blue Frog happy hour for great drink values.There were a couple of drawbacks, however.  The food in the park was a little disappointing.   There were not a lot of carts available and I found almost no Asian street food.  There also needs to be more rides.  I expect that this is coming.  This park has a lot of room to add.  I know that Star Trek is coming and I home some little kids' rides are added, as well."
1196,4.0,Dec 2016,N/A,Nice stay at disneyland,"Have been to DL in Hongkong and Japan previous to Shang Hai Disneyland.Went on a Thursday in early december and felt that the park was on the quieter side of things. Park was very large in comparison to my past experiences with disney. Lots of space and did not feel crowded at all.Arrived at 10.45am and we managed to do 5 rides (popular ones) within 4 hours (lunch inclusive in 4 hours).The longest we waited for a ride was 20 minutes.Review of rides (in order of preference):1. TRON - by far, the best ride in the park. Ride was brief (45 seconds or so) but thrilling and very modern. We rode this twice.2. PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN - slow start, but became very entertaining3. 7 dwarfes family coaster - nothing exciting but decent family coaster (note: family level excitement)4. Peter pan - mehBe advised that very little english is spoken by staff and all entertainment in chinese only.Staff were not rude, but were not friendly either - no enthusiasm, unlike other DLs we have been toOther notes: the chinese smoke everywhere and anywhere in the park. Staff could not care less.Grounds were kept very clean (toilets clean also)Food was expensive but you will feed yourself with a meal for approx USD$12How to get there: last stop of metro line 11 (disney land stop) took about 40 minutes from central Shanghai (add 10 minutes walk to the actual park from metro exit)We felt the magic and did not want to leave (although we had to after 4 hours due to some time conatraints)WIR - yep, in 5 years or so minimum."
1197,4.0,Nov 2016,"Shanghai, China ",First time,"First time go to Shanghai Disneyland, I pick on weekdays, so there are less people. It is beautiful just as other Disneyland parks, a bit disappointed, they do not have a lot of good chinese  food."
1198,5.0,Nov 2016,"San Francisco, CA ",MAGICAL IN EVERY WAY!,"I've finally completed by bucket list goal of visiting every Disney park. Shanghai has the best of all the parks - and it is distinctly Disney, and authentically Chinese. We came during low LOW season as it was cold and raining, but the park was empty! The average wait time for rides in the morning was about 5-10 minutes. Peak afternoon time, the average wait was about 30. We were able to ride Tron about 20x! The cast members are great - they are really friendly! Even with minor language barriers, they were more than helpful and amplified ""the disney way."" The food options are also the GREATEST. As a huge fan of Chinese food, having an endless selection of dumplings, noodles, porridge, and asian snacks was like heaven for me. Disneytown has some great restaurants and shops as well and it stays open a lot later than the park. Worth checking out. Last but not least - the merchandise. Each little store has its own themed merchandise, so if you see something you like, either note it down or get it. Don't think you'd be able to find it elsewhere. (The general ""shanghai Disney"" merch you can find everywhere) Love love loved it! Can't wait to go back. "
1199,5.0,Nov 2016,"Sydney, Australia ",A pleasant surprise ,"Our business team was offered a brief escorted tour as part of our business meetings. All the iconic, traditional Disney landmarks and sights are available to be seen, however their ability to 'localise' the resort with Chinese themes was tastefully executed. This being the largest Disney resort outside of the US, it's scale is impressive - and they're even now starting to expand further to become the largest in the world. Being midweek and late in the day, the crowds were thankfully limited. The technology used for the only 2 rides we had time for (Pirates of the Caribbean and Tron) is nothing short of breathtaking. All cast members were extremely friendly and polite, even those who spoke little English. Well done Disney, but I'd hate to be there in the middle of summer with the masses..."
1200,4.0,Oct 2016,"Toronto, Canada ",Completely different..,"I had a goal to go to this park before the end of the year - I wanted to experience a brand new Disney park within six months of opening.  I've been to all the parks around the world, and here are my thoughts..This Disneyland is completely different for a number of reasons.  Aesthetically, it's a very unique park with very few copies of rides from around the globe.  There are a handful of kids rides that have been brought over and updated, but other than that this park is brand new.  I won't spend too much time talking about the attractions (lots of information can be found online) but from the futuristic Tomorrowland with Tron to Adventure Isle with its rapid ride, most of the rides in Shanghai are new.And they are incredibly well done up and fun.  Many technological enhancements have been applied to this modern park.  The highlight, in my mind, is the new Pirates of the Caribbean, a stunning mix of screens and scenes as your boat moves around the water.  But this ride is just an example of how Disney is showing off it's muscle in how to build a brand new park.Now the bad.  The guests can be hard to deal with.  We experienced so much running and pushing, it was almost overwhelming.  Kids went to the bathroom in planters.  It's pretty crazy what kind of guests attend this park (and nothing like the park guests in Hong Kong, not 2 hours away by plane).  Food prices in the park were also fairly high and I felt, poor in quality.  We had a hamburger in Tomorrowland that was bland and over $10, surprising for a park that wasn't that expensive to enter in the first place.Overall, will you have fun?  Yes.  Do you need a whole day?  Yes.  The park is small, but it can be very crowded.  If not, Disneytown next door has lots of places to kill time at or dine in.This park is accessible by Shanghai transit but the stops are fairly far apart so it takes awhile to get there.  Reportedly however, this is still the best method to reach the park.Have fun, and enjoy!  :)"
1201,4.0,Nov 2016,"Canton of Geneva, Switzerland ",Magical Moments but not as we know Disney,"I love Disney World in the States but Disneyland Shanghai has a different flair. It is still very good but the truly Disney Magic is missing and it is all Chinatized. Cast members do not give you the feeling that they know what Disney is all about... it is the usual Chinese rudeness and difficulties of finding staff who speaks English. There is no magic or happiness in their faces which gives you a whole different experience, unfortunately.Despite that the Park is amazing, rides are awesome: you have to do Tron first so you can go another time at the end. Roaring Rapids, Seven Dwarfs and the Treasure Cove are definitely the best rides and should not be missed. The shows are all in Mandarin, no subtitles which is unfortunate but the show at the Castle and the Parade are in both languages which was awesome. Not to forget that they have a Cheesecake Factory in Disneytown! For Western food there is not much to find in the Park and I recommend Disneytown, you can re-enter the Park.Unforgettable are the fireworks at the end of the day... stunning and totally Disney.Still loved the Park but it was just very different from the usual Disney and there is a long way to get there... I missed the overhappy cast members."
1202,5.0,Nov 2016,"Llanelli, UK ",A must for any Disney fan!,"Absolutely loved it! The park is beautiful. So many gardens, picnic areas and scenic walkways. The castle is awe-inspiring and there's loads of unique rides and attractions. The resort is so easily accessed from Shanghai city centre too. Can't wait to go back again!"
1203,3.0,Jun 2016,"Charlotte, NC ",Trial period - work to do,"Went during the opening dry run. Lots of people, popular rides were overrun. Had to plan accordingly, and only had one chance for Tron ride (which was impressive). Lots of attempted line cutters (cultural norm here in China), but generally folks were tame. Many attractions were open, so hoping things got better during the year. Live in Shanghai, but will not return, better to go to Orlando in early Dec and have access to everything, reliably. "
1204,4.0,Nov 2016,"Hartsville, SC ",Jury is still out..,"Went here for the second time yesterday and was shocked at how different it was from my first visit. My first visit back in September was nothing short of magical!  Yesterday, however was very lack-luster.  I had talked the park up to all my friends only for them to ask yesterday ""us this the same place you spoke of?""  Yesterday rather than being greeted with the happy and jovial faces and attitudes that is synonymous with a Disney park, we were greeted with stone faces of determination. With that said, there were some happy workers, just not nearly the number there was in September. As for the park, it needs more, it's new. There are only a few good rides:  Pirates, Tron and 7 dwarfs. All others are pretty much typical and ordinary. Was wowed by Pirates though!  The pirate stunt show was cheesy until the actual 5 mins of stunts. The skydiving action was amazing!  The Tarzan show was a great incorporation of traditional Asian acrobatic feats set to African backgrounds.  Both of these shows are worth watching even if you don't speak mandarin. Christmas wasn't as played up as I thought, but the tree was nice.  The light and fireworks show at the end of the night was much better last night than the first visit I had, and it truly made me feel like a little kid again. Overall a decent park, but more can and should be done, though for brand new, a positive start. "
1205,3.0,Oct 2016,"Salvador, BA ",Far Short of Magical,"I visited on a Wednesday in October after the fall holiday, by all accounts low season. There are simply not enough attractions for the crowds, and wait times were exceeding long. The staff overall cannot communicate in English and was not helpful in answering questions. We were misinformed about the fast-track tickets, with an employee telling us they were sold out for the day, when this was true only for that section of the park. Posted wait times are far underestimated. We chose Honey Pot Spin for wait time of 20 minutes, whereas 30 minutes into the wait we were only halfway through the maze. A simple and quick ride was not worth an hour in line! Malfunction is another problem. We encountered broken laser guns on Buzz Lightyear (three times in three rounds on the ride); Voyage to the Crystal Grotto closed due to malfunction after we had waited more than an hour in line (when posted 40 minutes); and when we tried to go for a second time on our favorite attraction (in part cost benefit of length of attraction vs. wait time), Pirates of the Caribbean, it too was broken. Disney Shanghai is far below the experience of  Disney World in Orlando and the original Disneyland in California. A highlight was the Lion King show. Very clever production, with highly skilled performers.  Overall, not worth the time of the money."
1206,4.0,Nov 2016,"Singapore, Singapore ",pleasant surprise on some ride- overall ok if there is lesser people,"overall nice trip, food generally is exp but portion and option is good; rides will need to download the APP to plan and monitor closely, for those popular ride get the FP first; go on off peak will be great, as we went on Friday the longer opening hour, the crowd is quite huge and queue at popular ride is long. there is sufficient water point and toilet;"
1207,5.0,Nov 2016,"Phoenix, AZ ",Pure Magic!,"You might think if you've done Disneyland or Disney World how could Shanghai Disney be that different but IT IS!!  Disney truly did a great job on the park and it feels like pure Disney magic but also new and different.  The park is made for high capacity so even though we were told 40,000 people were at the park, walkways didnt feel crowded and lines werent that long. Rides and ""lands"" are very similar to what you've seen in other parks but again Shanghai Disney has done a great job making certain areas new again!  The new Tron ride and and revamped Pirates of the Caribbean are a MUST.  Food is both Eastern and Western . . . my favorites were the mickey shaped baked buns, the corn dog, and the turkey leg. and of course there are tons and tons of shopping options so leave time for that!  Only thing I found surprising was the park closes relatively early on the off season (7 pm) so again, plan accordingly."
1208,4.0,Nov 2016,"Beijing, China ",Thumbs Up!,"Seems that they did a good job improving after the opening hiccups, well done Shanghai Disneyland! The park is relatively clean with a huge walking area. The cons were not enough benches and smoking is allowed in the park (designated area but no one bothers nor were they told off). We went on a Fri, low season and queues were still expected. The wait for Tron took 75mins, other rides took 40 to 60 mins in general. It would be best to go on other weekdays as the waiting time might be shorter. Mickey parade starts at 4pm and fireworks finale starts at 8pm. Food inside the park is expensive and quality is disappointing. A burger set cost 85rmb at Tomorrowland which isn't worth it. Bring your own food or buy some light snacks from disneytown located outside the park. Transport back to town is not a problem. Line 11 subway and taxis are available, we left the park almost near 10pm and cab fare cost 118rmb back to People's Square."
1209,4.0,Sep 2016,"Wakefield, UK ",If you like Disney it's a must,Single day spent at the park and enjoyed every minute. The pirate of the Caribbean ride is brand new and is by far the best. Check it out on YouTube. The park can be fully experienced on a single quiet day. The only ride I didn't experience was Tron due to technical difficulties.
1210,5.0,Nov 2016,"Toronto, Canada ",Disney Efficiendados do Shanghai,"We have always been a Disney Family and we have vowed to experience each and every one of their parks and compare to WDW..  .Let it BE Known.  Nothing Compares to WDW.  There is no other place like it.  But Shanghai Disney.  Has some incredible attractions.  You have to be aware you are in China so nothing will be the same as home.  But This park is Fantastic.  The attractions are awesome and my personal favorite was the Tron Roller Coaster.  In true Disney Style this high speed coaster is amazing from the time you step into you Tron Cycle.  The sites and sounds make you feel like you are in the world of Tron.  I wont give any spoilers but i will tell you it is worth the ride.  Lines are long becasue you are in a city of 26,000,000 and it is the grand opening this year so there are lots of people.  WE too the Metro from Downtown Shanghai to the park.  It took about an hour due to trains being taken out of service.  Return was much smoother and we took 45 minutes.  The day at the park was a great day.  We had dinner in the Downtown Disney area which is great.  They even have a  little Cheesecake Factory.  We ate at the Thai Restaurant which was excellent and very reasonably priced.  That is the other thing, people who think things are cheap in China are incorrect. You can buy the typical trinkets and bargain in the markets, but we spent time reviewing prices in the department stores and their prices for the same TVs we have or washers dryers fridges blenders etc. are equal or more in price.  The park tickets are reasonable at about 73$ CDN.  Definitely worth the visit.  a 2 day pass may be worth while considering the lines will be long."
1211,5.0,Oct 2016,Thailand ,Very impress,"Must visit. I really enjoyed there. It is located at the end of line 11 named Disney Resort. Tron is must visited, it is a roller coster."
1212,2.0,Oct 2016,"Cobham, UK ",You will be lucky to get on 2 rides,"About an hours drive ($35) from Shanghai near the Peoples Park,  Shanghai Disneyland has a massive and long walk to the actual entrance. Many people took suitcases, selfie sticks and folding stools with them only to be told they had to pay to place them in a locker as they were not allowed inside the park. Tickets cost about another 70/per person. The website that processed ticket purchases crashed - and so after an hour we wound up being told to phone in our purchase. The park itself feels smaller than the original. Western style food is almost nonexistant in the park except for the downtown area which had a thin steak slice meal. We were not told that fast track tickets were limited- we didn't even know that fastrack were available. By the time we arrived, around 11am, there were no fast track tickets left. This wound up meaning that we had to line up queue for each ride and at 90min+ per ride (our child could not wait that long) we only went on two rides. The first ride was the FABULOUS not to be missed Pirates of the Carribean and the second was the flume. We did go inside the castle to see the interactive snow white tale. We only managed to get on the flume in the last 20 minutes that the park was open. My child also spent a short while in the area where you can squirt eachother with cannon guns.All in all, yes the themed buildings were gorgeous, but it is not worth spending so much money without a guarantee that you will go on a certain amount of rides."
1213,4.0,Nov 2016,"Melbourne, Australia ",Great place for low season visit only,"Great firework and light show. Staff are very nice but not good at English.

1214,3.0,Nov 2016,"Shanghai Region, China ",Great for first timers but not as magical as a Disneyland should be,"This is a long review. Pardon my OCD.Going anywhere populated with tourists is a challenging endeavour in China. As my niece was in town, I decided to brave the crowds and take a peek at the very new Disneyland and see if it is worth all the hype.Disneyland opens at 9.00am. We chose a Monday to visit in hoping for the least crowds. We set off at 8.45pm.The Journey:We left for Disneyland from the French Concession area in Shanghai by Uber and so, the commute took about an hour (with bad traffic in the morning). The driver had to drop us off at a road closed off to non-parking cars (at the end of Qimiao Road, near Herb Garden) and so, we begrudgingly made our way in. This is the furthest a non-parking car can go. If you are driving, you can park nearer and walk lesser to the park.If you have children and elderly with you, this may not be ideal as the walk in is at least 15 minutes (we brisk-walked). A good stroller helps. The path in is wide, clean and perfectly manicured though.There is a train station just six minutes (walk) to the main entrance of Disneyland. I may use that the next time I have to visit Disneyland. A lot  less walking.The Park:I was greeted with about 10 semi-long lines to have out bags security screen. That went by without a hitch.The next section was to queue to enter the park. We booked our tickets online the day before and so, we brought a passport (for the person who made the booking) and queued to have out online ticket scanned and processed for entry.We were in.They do not provide guide maps at the entry like the American or European Disneylands. The holders for them are all empty. We did, however, pick one up, in English, further into the park when we spotted it (a lady was manning a cart with the guide map).Shanghai Disneyland is five times bigger than its Hong Kong counterpart. It is huge. Wear comfortable shoes. The temperature was between 16- 19 that day but from all the walking, a coat was not necessary at all. Just a light sweater would do. At the entrance, signages offer a ""Disney Resort"" app for you to download and monitor ride queue timings (and other details). You should download this. You HAVE TO download this. Rides & Entertainment:EVERYTHING IS IN CHINESE.The narration for the ride, the words that the characters say - Darth Vader spouted something in Chinese when we took a picture with him, the backstory written on walls, and the guides manning everything. I speak Chinese (fairly) and read some Chinese. It is not what I expected. Seeing the characters I have been so familiar with speak Mandarin, it just took all the magic away for me. I could not connect with what I was seeing.In Europe and America, they have everything in English first then the other languages will come in. Disneyland to me is an American brand. Even the character performances are done by Chinese men, in Mandarin. I was not able to reconcile that. I do not think that bothered everyone around me as 98% of people in the park is Chinese that day. I guess it is just me.Rides Taken/Attractions Visited:Tomorrowland1.TRON Lightcycle (Roller Coaster type ride) - Will need to store all bags in lockers before commencing the ride. Lockers are free for the first hour at ride venue. We got a fastpass and while waiting, went to take:2. Buzz Lightyear Rider - Shooting with ""laser"" gun ride. Simple fun.3. Star Wars Launch Bay - An area with everything Star Wars. Took pictures with characters.Extra: Stitch and Baymax were available for photo taking.Fantasyland1. Enchanted Storybook Castel - Good for children. Roam the castle with mini stories in different rooms. A lot of stair-climbing, upwards then downwards. Not elderly-friendly.2. Peter Pan's Flight - Fun, light-hearted ride (took a pastpass and skipped the 60 minute wait)3. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh - Simple ride. Not worth the 50 minutes wait.Treasure Cove1. Pirates of the Caribbean - Waited 45 minutes. Fun ride.Adventure Ise1. Soaring Over the Horizon - An Imax-type experience. Simulates a very quick (and HIGH) hot air balloon ride. Queued for 2 HOURS. Will not queue for 2 hours again if I have to take this ride with a visitor.The rest of the rides or attractions did not quite appeal to my party of 2 adults and a 19-year old, or the wait was too long.Food:We had lunch at the very, lovely The Cheesecake Factory. It tasted exactly like the ones in America. Fantastic.Fireworks:Similar to the ones overseas but I think to cater to the Chinese market, it starts earlier (7.00pm). Less impressive than their other counterparts but still quite spectacular. Departure:Not wanting to be caught in the huge cluster of people leaving after the Firework show, we were the first ones to leave just before the show ended. Had to trudge 15 minutes back out to the main road for the car service we called (used Didi instead of Uber this time). Journey back to the French Concession took an hour and cost 115 RMB.I will go back if I have to bring relatives or friends (I love) there. The place is clean, wide and spacious and everything is new and nice. It just doesnt have that magic for me though."
1215,5.0,Nov 2016,UK ,Truly magical time,"Having spent years slowly watching the park come to fruition, to say I was excited about this visit is an understatement! This was my 6th (and final) Disney location around the world.The park was incredible. It's clear that Disney has learned from all the other parks around the world, and created a hybrid that ticks every box.We made careful use of fastpass, and though the park was busy we managed to do everything (except Crytal Grotto which was closed), and never queued more than 40mins. In fact our average queue time was about 15 mins.The Tarzan show was excellent. I loved that they sign at the end!Cast members everywhere were top notch.I never really witnessed the 'ghastly behaviour' some others have expressed. I did smell cigarette smoke in the bathrooms a couple of times, but surely this happens in every Disney park. There was no real pushing or repulsive behaviour. A few times people used flash photography on the rides, but when we politely asked them to stop, they did so immediately.Pirates was by far our favourite attraction, and we did this 4 times!We will definitely be going back."
1216,4.0,Nov 2016,"Johor Bahru, Malaysia ",Very Exciting Park,"Great time spent with family.  Go during weekdays are better with less crowd.  Waiting time for activities are acceptable.  No special queue for disabled guest which I say as a downside of this place.  Even though park brochure indicated ""May remain in wheelchair""  but in actual fact, disabled guest to lift themselves.  We experience in 2 activities and one of them is Captain Jack rides.  All shows are in Chinese which I can understand but putting the subtitles at the side of the stage in English will be great for non-Chinese speaking guests.  Hong Kong Disneyland did a great job in this and Shanghai Disneyland should follow."

We hired a stroller for our 2 year old and instantly began to meet characters. We were astounded by the lack of queues for the character meet and greets. We didn't wait any longer than 15 minutes to meet a character (including marvel characters). The park is very large so there's a lot of walking to go between attractions. There wasn't a lot of snack options. The fast passes were of benefit especially as we only had one day in the park. The line for most rides was very short. We walked straight on to some rides including the Pirates of the Caribbean ride which was amazing. The longest we waited was 40 mins for the Tron light cycle ride but it was incredible and worth the wait. The parade shouldn't be missed, the kids loved seeing all their favourite characters on spectacular floats. The evening fireworks and light projection show were fantastic and a highlight of the day.

It was amazing...it would have been better if we didn't have to queue for 2 hours (my only criticism). The staff were great, TRON (the new fancy roller coaster) was fantastic - although a little short, and I'd happily visit again! My advice...go early and check out the free fast passes. The later it gets the longer the queues everywhere. And if you're on a budget (like we were) take a packed lunch with you as there are plenty spaces to chill out and eat what you brought. If you are interested in the food onsite they have everything you could wish for! The Mickey and Minnie chocolate ice creams were amazing although expensive. Another foodie highlight is the food street outside the park (they have Cheesecake Factory!!! I was in heaven!). All in it was a great day out for a decent price in western money! Compared to every day Chinese prices it was pretty expensive. "

The snow white and mines is also good.d.Adventure Isle is greatBut you have to walk faster to cover it all in a day. Not much for the elders but great for young, youth and kids.Please carry water bottle they have enough water facets. I think it lacked instructions like not for people with Blood pressure, heart issues etc. which are important."
1221,5.0,Nov 2016,"Melbourne, Australia ",Get ready to be totally amazed!,"I visited early November with a family of five people - my parents who are approaching 60, my husband and my five year old son.  To my surprise, everyone loved it, including my parents!  The subway journey was quick and convenient, once you get off, there is only a short walk before you reach the entrance.  Disney Town is outside and is free, so you can always come back and re-visit or take older family members to admire the beautiful buildings.  It's mainly just restaurants and retail shops though, and be warned that the food served here are not the best, but they are a lot cheaper (about half the price) than inside Disneyland.If you want to get Fast Passes, you have to get inside as soon as they open.  We arrived just after 11am and all the Fast Passes were booked out.  However, since it was still pretty early and it was a week day, we got on the Pirates of Caribbean ride with no wait at all!  When we walked out, my dad was ecstatic and he said that the price of the ticket was already worth it, although we've only been on one ride.  We then went to have lunch, the price was pretty steep.  It didn't bother us too much as we live in Australia and after conversion, it costed about the same as having a meal in a restaurant here, but it'll be pretty expensive for locals in my opinion.  The Soaring Over the Horizon after lunch was the highlight of our day.  The wait was about an hour and this is on a week day.  I can only imagine how long it'll be for weekends.  Though the wait was worth it.  My mother, whom I haven't seen on a ride for more than twenty years was beaming and my five year old nagged me for hours afterwards to go on it again.  I would if the wait was shorter!We also went on the Roaring Rapids, which was very exciting.  You will get quite wet so have disposable rain covers ready.  We did not bring any but when you reach the front, you can see people getting off and just extend out your hand and most people will be nice enough to hand you theirs.  They leave a few huge bins there so most of those thin plastic rain coats just get thrown out in those bins anyway.  You'll be doing the environment a favour by using someone else's second hand rain coats.Didn't get a chance to go on the Tron ride but I'm sure I'll be visiting again in the near future and I'll try to go next time.I remember seeing someone saying that the toilets here are mostly squat cubicles, this is actually untrue.  They have a lot of normal, sitting toilet cubicles and they're very, very clean, so no need to worry.  Unlike most other public toilets in Shanghai, you don't need to bring your own tissue paper.Lastly, the fireworks were magical.  You have to stay for the fireworks show.  It does get very crowded approaching 7pm, so if you have the luxury, try to be at the front viewing point by 6.30pm at the latest to snatch your front row spot.  Otherwise you'll be forever on tiptoes if you're short like me.  We couldn't as we finished our last ride at 6.50pm!  Remember that all rides finish at 7pm and the park will close straight after the fireworks, so don't plan to do any rides after as there won't be any.Overall, it was a tiring but fulfilling day.  So grab all your family members young and old and get ready for some magic."

Favorite ride would had to of been the Tron ride if you're seeking adrenaline! Only downside was the long waits (2 hours for some rides) and having people cut past you saying there family is ahead in the cue and they need to go to them. Such a good place though it didn't get to me much. One thing to be at a good view of the castle just before 7pm for the firework show! Absolutely breathtaking!

This place is so huge but clean. Best time to visit is during autumn Oct 15 onwards. Cost wise, ticket is less expensive compared to other resort, food is tasty and suits for all visitors (I think). Accessibility is just 50mins subway train ride from downtown, cost CNY6 only. Security is tight and took us almost one hour to get in. Ticket can purchase from the ticket booth. Rides in Tomorrowland the best but queue is about 30-50minutes. We love the Frozen show. Highly recommended for families with children."

1230,5.0,Oct 2016,"Shanghai Region, China ","Tips and hints for 1st timers and 2nd timers too!!!, Special comment for Halloween Day","2nd time to visit this place (last was October 31st for Halloween), so here are some tips to get the most of of your trip to this amazing and fun place:- If planning to go on Halloween day, you'll be dissapointed big time!!, there is really nothing special going on inside the park for the Halloween theme, is just another normal day, some parties and activities at Disneytown but nothing inside the park, really nothing!!!- When to go: during weekdays avoid weekends, and interesting to know that for rainy days the locals normally avoid to go, so even if the forecast says slightly raining, for sure you'll find less people just bring your poncho and you'll do ok, obviously avoid to go if there is a thyphoon warning :) or you'll be soak wet. I just went on Monday 31st and Tron waiting time was 20 minutes, I had the chance of riding it 4 times!!!! slight rain but was totally worth it.- Tickets: you can but directly on disney website, cost the same and you can avoid the line and the ticket booth, you can then pick them up directly at the park entrance (avoid ticket booth), you'll need to show your reservation number and passport. - Best rides: Tron and Pirates of Caribbean, Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Soaring over the Horizon has the longest waiting time of all attractions but for me was just a big IMAX, seems to be a huge attraction for the locals but honestly don't see why the buzz- Best shows: Frozen and Tarzan, although all in chinese still you can feel the good vibe and the excitment of the actors- When to go: arrive at 8:30, so you can go through the security check and be at the main gate at 9:00 (opening time)- How to get there?: take Subway Line 11, all the way to the end to Disney Resort Station. Station is just 10 min walking from main park entrance.- Closing time: check well, closing time on this season is earlier, for example I went on Monday October 31st and closing time was 19:00 - Meals prices: depends where you go, but normally plan to spend between 60 - 90 rmb/person for each meal.- Snacks: you do can bring some snacks and water on your backpack, no problem and recommended to munch something between meals. You can bring your own water bottle, there are several spots where you can refill it.- If with small kids, bring your own stroller or you can get one at disney just be aware that the demand is high and they do run out of them. For the rides check in advanced the height restriction of each ride.- The personnel at Disney do speak english, some very good some other don't but definitely make a good effort for customer service, although per the other reviews I can see that sometimes this doesn't happen but overall staff people are nice.- Local people cutting lines, yes it wil happen and you'll get mad, this definetly exist is a local thing that seems to be accepted, but really not polite for western stardards, so just be calm and tell them no, most of the time they'll stop. Don't let this to waste your whole Disney experience.- Fast pass run out really quick, plan your day well and remind that you can get only one fast pass per person per ride at a time and then another once the previous time expires, so selecting the wrong one can block you for hours until you can get another one.- Next to Disney there is Disneytown you'll find stores and restaurants there. No need to pay for this area, is located outside the theme park, good to spend a few hrs.- Download the Disney Shanghay Resort App, among many things, will tell you the waiting time in real time, helpful when deciding where to go when running between rides."
1231,4.0,Oct 2016,"Gold Coast, Australia ","Disneyland, Shanghai.","A long train ride out from central Shanghai, but worth it. The walk from the station at Disneyland is a long way from the security and ticket office. I think Disneyland in Hong Kong is better, but this one is certainly worth a visit if time is not a problem. The usual Disneyland type of attractions are busy at most times and waits of 30 minutes to 1 hour are not unusual. If you have visited other Disneyland's around the World it may not be worth the time involved."
1232,4.0,Oct 2016,phoenix ,Excellent to see once!,"Standard excellent Disney quality, but with everything built on a larger scale.  The park is big and they left a lot of room to grow inside the park that's currently green space.  Tron, the Adventure Walks and the Pirates ride are three must see/do attractions. It's hard to find a time or day that huge crowds aren't in the park, but avoid Friday - Sunday if possible. Much of the park attends the parades, so during those times, you can ride the Tron ride over and over.  The rest of the day, you might wait 2 hours to ride it once.  Keep in mind that the Tron ride and the Adventure Walks require you to stow your backpacks and any bags in a locker.  That locker wait can take as long as the ride wait, so you may be better off finding a set of lockers for another close area rather than using the official ride lockers.  They do need to work on their time estimates, as you'll often be in a line far longer than the official estimate given.  Despite the ban on selfie sticks, you're sure to dodge 10 or 20 during your visit.  "
1233,5.0,Oct 2016,"Fullerton, CA, ",Some tips for maximum positive park experience --,"A few hints from a Disneyland season ticket holder for over 15 years and has visited every single Disney resort park worldwide. To get the most out of your visit to Shanghai Disneyland: (1) if possible, avoid Chinese holidays and weekends.(2) purchase tickets ahead of time online (3) arrive at park entrance one hour before official opening time. This early in the morning It takes about 20 minutes to get through security and about 20 minutes to get through the entrance gates. Once inside the park, you cannot go further into the park than the first major intersection of Mickey Ave. It is roped off there. The rope barriers were dropped from 15 minutes before (on one day) or at the ""official opening time"" (the other two days). (4) Have a plan - which way you want to go first - to the left for Tron or to the right for pirates and soaring -  either to get fast passes or get in line for these most popular attractions.(5) The later in the day you arrive - the longer the lines, less (or no) availability of fast passes and the more crowded it gets (6) after doing Tron, Pirates and Soaring, then the rest of your day can be based on wait-times of rides you are considering, available fast passes, your specific interests, etc. (7)The evening  fireworks, laser and animated projection show onto the front of the castle is definitely worth seeing. However if you are in the front of the castle area, be prepared for a mass chaos of people crowding into areas where there's no room for them among people who have already tried to establish their territory. You can get great photos of the castle projections from here, but the show is not very enjoyable due to the overcrowding. We watched it twice in the park. But our favorite time, was the third time when we viewed the show after our dinner, sitting at our table on the outdoor terrace of Wolfgang Puck's in Disney Town overlooking the Park. Generalizations - Park guests seem to be at least 99% Chinese, so there are definitely cultural differences! Also, little English is spoken or even understood by cast members. But some English is spoken by leads and management. No, or minimal English during the shows - or even ""subtitled translations"". Tarzan show is basically a Chinese Acrobat performance and is very enjoyable without any translation necessary.The  Pirate stunt show - the first part drags but once into the theater, the great set and stunts don't need translation. Even when other rides and attractions are very busy, Star Wars Launch Bay and Character Interaction, Marvel Universe, and the Alice in Wonderland Maze are almost vacant and definitely worth a visit,If time & space permitted. I could go on & on, but I think you have the idea. Other than the Disney characters, the themed rides, the overall ""Disney"" atmosphere and some of the attractions themselves, your experience here may feel very different than in any other Disney park, with the possible exception of Hong  Kong. But Hong Kong is a much smaller, more intimate park and English is understood by more of the cast members - possibly from their history of being a British colony for so many years. We have been to HKD twice - once when it first opened and it was not very crowded at all, and we really enjoyed it. Then again last year, when it was much more crowded, but we also had a good time. As far as your trip to Shanghai Disneyland Resort - do a little research, figure out which rides or attractions will be your priority, go with an open mind and you'll be fine."

1237,2.0,Aug 2016,"Athens, Greece ",Suggested only under horrible weather conditions!,"The truth is that Shanghai's Disneyland is a very beautiful place. The whole set (buildings, facilities, shops etc) proves that has been a lot of planning and good workmanship. Yes indeed all those things are very nice BUT...there are HUGE DISADVANTAGES that might render your visit a nightmare. The main problem is ""the enormous crowds"". I suppose that if someone does NOT visit this place in a weekend or an ordinary day with good weather and his family, it might be an enjoyable experience BUT with normal conditions and with his/her family it will make him/her to wonder why the whole day was ruined and why so much money was spent. I shall give some examples from my experience during a weekend in August: a) At 1000 am all strollers for little children had been taken already.b) All the spaces in the cafes, restaurants etc where occupied. Thus, even at starbucks you drink your coffee standing and really close to another 30-40 unknown persons.c) HUGE WAITING LINES FOR EVERY RIDE/ACTIVITY(This fact makes you really wonder what kind of people would have been eager to wait more than 2 hours -as per signs- in order to have a ride of 2 minutes!!!) d) There are lines even for taking a photo with Mickey and Minnie or Donald and Daisy. The sympathetic characters wait for 10 min for the photos and then leave but the concentrated crowd might require more than 30 min in order the photos to be taken. Thus, you see M&Ms or D&Ds > You run.e) Shops are not cheap and even if you do want to buy something you will have to wait so very much (Even for an ice cream or small souvenir).f) The whole Disneyland area is really big in size and under whatever weather conditions one feels tired very easily (e.g. imagine walking with your family for long time under the strong sun and without a stoller).g) There are some stops (you will never find out why) in the operation of various activities that make situation even worse."
1238,2.0,Oct 2016,"Bendigo, Australia ",I think they forget what disneyland is!,"Ok so its only my second Disneyland ever, however this is a very sad excuse for one.So much going wrong for it I am not sure were to start. First the lines, OK i get it its a theme park and there is a wait. However one and a half hours for a ride they said was 70 minutes. Whomever designed this park didn't think of rides. Definitely not enough rides for the amount of people they must have known would come thru the gates. In 8 hours we got in 3 rides due to the wait. Also if your a thrill seeker don't bother at all. The rides were yawn worthy and screams stopped within about 2 seconds of ride starting due to how boring they are. The food vans/carts closed right on 5 o'clock. We had just come of a ride that was the 1.5 hour wait go to get a drink, sorry we closed. There was 4 people standing around, the drinks were there however would not serve us. This happened at 3 carts.I think they are wanting more money from their little shops around then actually for the Disneyland experience. I understand they need to make money and we are tourists, however you really are not there to shop.The staff and characters do not live up to the Disneyland expectation. Not friendly and definitely not what Disneyland represents.The parade is over very quickly and not worth the time to sit there.The lights and fireworks were good at the end, However hard to see due to the amount of people being rude and pushy and standing in front of you, with their balloons in your way of sight. This is after you been waiting and they push in to watch.Over all this is not a Disneyland experience that I wanted for a second time(HONG KONG being my first) and would not recommend to any one. I looked up before I left and emailed about tickets etc. I am from Australia and needed my passport, I was aware of this before hand however they really only want you to know your passport number."

1250,3.0,Oct 2016,"London, UK ",Disappointed but let's remember it just opened.,"I've been to all the Disney parks except for Florida, and I have to say, Shanghai has the potential to be amazing, but right now isn't the best. I did travel here during Golden Week, so the park was exceptionally busy, which didn't help. Everyone saying the park is dirty is being ridiculous. The park has so many cleaners it's unreal. They are walking around everywhere constantly picking up litter and making sure the toilets are clean. I had no issues with cleanliness. The one time I did see litter was in a queue for a ride, but we all concluded it must have been the only place a cleaner couldn't get to. Smokers are an issue, there's designated smoking areas, but people are either unaware of them or don't care. There aren't many big ticket rides, and due to the amount of people in the crowd, lines are particularly long, making it impossible to do more than a few attractions. You need to pick wisely. However, Tron and Pirates Of The Caribbean are INCREDIBLE. I found myself gasping and wowing at how good they both are. PotC is particularly amazing when compared to rides at other parks. The details are spectacular and they've really worked hard to make the experiences as immersive as possible. The merchandise was lacking, especially when compared to the other asian parks in Hong Kong and Tokyo. There wasn't enough diversity and most shops stocked similar items. We actually found better stuff in the World Of Disney store in DisneyTown.For food, we had pastries in the morning which were amazing, and burgers in the afternoon that were cold and not as tasty as they looked. We tried getting pretzels but were told there was an hour wait as they dealt with orders. Surely if something is so popular you put more stalls around the park..... Mickey Avenue is super short, which is surprising considering the size of the park, but is incredible charming, as is the whole park. It does need some more big ticket rides to help ease the congestion. I wouldn't write off a trip here, but I would definitely try and go during a quieter time."

But you need to wait like 1-2 hrs for a ride, so i suggest you to go to a guest service when you arrive to get a fast track ticket for your desired ride for free!!! The castle was huge! Beautiful... it was so magical...just what i do not like is that, most man who enters shanghai disneyland smokes everywhere even though the security guards told them that they are not allowed to smoke... this is harmful to childrens health. Anyhow it was a very enjoyable place to be. "

The park is similar to how the other parks are laid out across the world.  If you are a Disney fan, a visit to this park is a must.With that said, there are a few things to keep in mind and expect when coming to this park in Shanghai.First, queuing can be frustrating with people jumping in and out of line and personal space.Second, fast passes are limited so get them early before they run out.Third,  expect more litter than normal throughout the park, especially after the light show in the evening.Enjoy your time at the park!"
1257,5.0,Oct 2016,"Bandung, Indonesia ",Shanghai Disneyland,"This is my first visit. I am very happy to meet Mickey Mouse at The Gardens of Imagination. The parade is amazing, there are Mickey mouse and pals (Minnie, Goofy, Donald etc), toy story, Mulan (and Mushu?) and other characters.Must see entertainment in this park :  Golden Fairytale Fanfare, Tarzan: Call of the Jungle, Mickey's Storybook Express. They have complete facilities. Toilet is everywhere, and it is very clean. They have faciliity for disable people. But I think the food is expensive here."
1258,2.0,Oct 2016,Haifa ,"Wait, walk, wait","The park is spread over an area that's big enough for the massive crowds of Chinese visitors (95% at least), but the amount of rides (specially the good ones like Tron, that are a small bunch) doesn't nearly suffice. Add the fact that usually 2 or more of the top rides are closed, and you end up with 60 minutes average waiting per ride, and that's on a mid October Tuesday. The park also opens late and closes at 7:00 p.m., so even maximizing fast passes you'll be lucky to score 6 rides. The rest of the time you'll be waiting in line or walking.Security and tickets check at the entrance can't cope with the crowd an is very slow.The staff is very well trained and courteous. About a third speak some English. I saw a kid getting hurt and 5 employees plus a doctor rushed to help. The cleanness and aesthetics have nothing to envy the American parks.Food is overpriced as expected, but there's free drinking water.In summary, nice to escape reality for a day, but forget the rides."
1259,5.0,Oct 2016,"Melbourne, Australia ",Magical Kingdom Chinese style,"I've been to most Disneylands and wanted to see the Chinese touch, I wasn't disappointed apart from the crowds. I cannot fault the place due to me being there during national week when more than usual number of people are there. Average wait for a ride was 180 minutes. Even to line up for a fast pass was 30 minutes. I wasn't there for the rides though but wanted to see how different it was, and it was. Very large to fill an entire day. Castle is huge! A couple of attractions the same, eg. Pirates of Caribbean (although not many anamatronics, mainly projection screens, but good and fun). Worth it if you're a Disney fan "
1260,2.0,Oct 2016,"Canberra, Australia ",Lineups ridiculous and fastpass system a joke,"I went on a Monday hoping to avoid crowds- but this strategy failed miserably.I was disappointed to miss 3 rides I was looking forward to because of the excessive cues (2-2.5 hours). Did not realise fast passes would stop being distributed by 10am- so basically only one fastpass allowed per day.  Had kids in tears because we missed out on the tron ride- not a magical day at all. Stayed for the light show, but couldn't see anything because of the crowds.  Waited 2 hours for kids to do the high ropes course (I sat outside the ride) and they had to exit half way around because Chinese people would not stop touching them.Like everything in china they don't care about the user experience- it's all about shoving as many people in to get their money.  They need to work out another system- get rid of the stupid fastpass system and release a certain number of VIP tickets that cost more but allow you to skip cues all day. Or simply halve the number of people allowed in and and double ticket price.And like other reviews have said- staff don't speak much English and those that do are not interested in helping.I wont be going back to this Disneyland, that's for sure."
1261,3.0,Oct 2016,"Kuching, Malaysia, ",Almost everything in Chinese,"Yes, they just opened and the first day we had a one hour wait before we got in.

1262,3.0,Oct 2016,"Shanghai, China ",Different from other Disneys,"The first thing that's unusual about Shanghai Disneyland is the main street... it's completely different from any other Magic Kingdom. It's short and quick. The castle is really big, especially compared to the one in Hong Kong (the tiniest one). The best ride is definitely Tron. It had a 30 minutes wait when we went. Really good. A very fast start! You can't carry any bags and must check everything that might fall out into a locker first, though. The Pirates of the Carribean was closed for refurbishment, in a brand new Disney park :(. The Buzz Lightyear ride broke down. If this is Chinese engineering then it's really worrying. The 7 Dwarves coaster (40 min wait) is similar to Big Thunder Mountain, pretty good. Of course there was some line cutting, but it was not excessive. Soaring Over the Horizon had a 2+ hours wait, so we skipped that. All the shows were in Chinese. I would say unless you are a small kid then avoid the Frozen show at all costs.Overall I prefer the Hong Kong Disneyland. Not only is it less crowded, it's better kept. And it has just as many good rides, which are not broken down or closed for refurbishment."
1263,3.0,Oct 2016,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India ",Not magical for non-Chinese people !!,"Its overcrowded and all the rides have only chinese language options. So for us it was not magical. If you have seen Disney at Hongkong you can give this a miss.You need to understand/use the fast pass system if you hope to cover this park.Basically FP are availabe only in 3 parks (Adventure,Tomorrow land,Fantasy,) for 2-3 rides in each park. You can take FP every 2 hours.So one person has to collect all the tickets and run to the FP counter ( one in each park) to collect the Fast passes while others line up in different ride."
1264,5.0,Sep 2016,"Torrance, CA ",Simply Magical - Shanghai Style,"If all possible, visits should be on the weekdays.  One, tickets are cheaper and two, it is less crowded.  Even if you have an evening and a day - it would really help out.  This park is amazing.  We started our visit on a Thursday Night.  We were very fortunate - lines were only 5-10 min. the longest being 20.  Even Tron (a must do) was only 10min.  It reminds me of the ride Screamin' in California Adventure but sitting on a Motorcycle.  Another highlight was Buzz Light Year, Adventures of Pooh, Pinocchio and Peter Pan.  My favorite of them all was the Pirates of the Caribbean Battle for the Sunken Treasure (GREAT Ride) and the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train with the cars only pivoted front and back.  We missed Soarin and Camp Discovery.  Like all other Asian Parks - use the Fast Passes as much as possible.  For shows, the Story of Tarzan was very entertaining, the Golden Fairytale Fanfare in front of the Castle shows must of the Princesses but the one to see is the evening show on the Castle - Ignite the Dream- a Nighttime Spectacular.  Be sure to find a spot early and be ready to keep it.  Food was good - did a lot of pointing.  Yuans preferred, credit cards accepted.  Tip: try to hit some of the good rides late.  Locals need to catch the last train out so the park clears / lines get shorter.  ENJOY!"
1265,4.0,Sep 2016,"Chippewa Falls, WI ",It's Disney,"After waiting for 2 years for it to be open, I just could not wait to go.  I read other reviews about lines and trash, but we had a great time.  We went during the week hoping to avoid lots of people.  Plan on waiting 20-30 minutes to get through security.  If you purchased your tickets online, just go right to the main gate and they will print them off for you.  They had grassy areas for people to sit and picnic if you wanted.  There are only a few places to get Fastpasses and those lines can be long.  The first day, we did not get any and never waited more than 40 minutes (Soarin') and the second day, we were going to get one and it was fully distributed by 10:00 am.  The different rides were nice, Tron, ropes course, canoes, and made for a good time.  The one big disappointment we had was The Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Sunken Treasure was closed for ""scheduled maintenance.""  Really?  The park has been open for barely 5 months.  And it was closed for 4 days, not just 1.  This is why the rating is 4 instead of 5.  Overall, go and have fun.  Cheapest Disney Park admission you can find."
1266,3.0,Sep 2016,N/A,Crowded but magical,Tickets are cheaper week days to weekends. Crowds and lines were too long. It took about an hour to get into the park through security etc. Inside the park lines were regularly 1 hour. The fast pass lines were almost as long as the ride lines! Tron was an awesome ride and overall it was the magic disney experience you'd expect from disney. But you need to be patient! There is a subway station which makes it easily accessible from shanghai city if a little long. We stayed at disney hotel which had reasonable rates for a disney hotel but expensive meals.

You can take as much pictures as you like. Only be aware that they will not allow you inside with bigger luggage and big tripod. If your tripod cant fit in your camera bag when folded you will need to put that to storage room and continue without. But the staff is very helpful with taking pictures so its not too big deal.

First up the park can suck up huge amounts of people and still not feel too crowded. Its states opening at 9am but we arrived at 8:30 and the park was already open and all the Fastpasses for Pirates and Tron had gone. Having said that the queuetimes at no point did were excessive.Probably waited an hour for Tron and Pirates each, rest were 20-30min at most. Tron was simply brilliant in as much the ice blue set as the ride. So cool and incredibly fast . Pirates was also great - we had young kids and they loved it. Great park, dont worry about crowds. We easily did 7 rides and had a brilliant day elaving at 3. The Metro is very near the gate on Line 11 and really cheap vs taxi.

1273,2.0,Sep 2016,"Bangor, UK ",The worst Disney park by a long shot.  Incredibly disappointing.,"I'm fortunate enough to say I've been to every Disney park.  Florida - Anahiem - Paris - Hong Kong - Tokyo and last but not least Shanghai.  I thought it would end on a high as I love Disneyland park but this one didn't meet my expectations.I remember watching a viral video months ago suggesting what the park was going to look like and how amazing it was going to be.I honestly think this park will be a massive flop for Disney.  There are more staff than guests.  The park is built to withstand 1000's of people but when we went everywhere was dead.  Ride queues are the same as Florida etc they are so long that you could wait for 2 hours to go on Buzz Lightyear's space blasters or whatever instead it's 5 minutes queue and a long walk for nothing.  The attractions all feel very short as well barring pirates of the carribean which was fantastic.The park also seems to be quite poor maintained.  It doesn't bother me as such but handrails in every ride, paint is chipping off and there are palm trees planted all over the park and each of the covers are completely rusted.  They look like they need replaced already.Very poor selection of food, went for a burger in the restaurant beside Tron and it was awful, it really upset my stomach and after that I didn't feel like going on any attractions.Luckily I was on a business trip in Shanghai therefore the park was nearby.  I wouldn't recommend anyone to make a trip to Shanghai just to go to Disney.  Hong Kong and Tokyo were a lot better in my opinion."
1274,4.0,Sep 2016,"Grantham, United Kingdom ",A good start - much more to come!,"I have been lucky enough to visit Disneyland Florida, Hong Kong and Paris so I was keen to visit and compare. I was initially concerned by reports of there being too many people, and the park being not well maintained but I found myself unexpectedly free on a Wednesday so took a chance.I traveled there by taxi but the taxi driver had a lot of difficulty finding the place and which entrance to go to once he got there. Clearly the place is so new that the Sat Navs don't show any of the roads yet. The queue for security was slow moving but not too long - but there was no queue at all for the tickets. This was at 10:00 on a Wednesday. The area which this park covers is vast and it is clear that it will not be long before the park expands. Because there is so much space, it never had the feeling of being packed. As the day went by, it was clear by the length of the queues for the attractions that there were far more people there than it seemed. The Castle is enormous - the biggest in the Disney Empire. The stage in front of it is an ideal focal point. Inside, the Once Upon a Time attraction takes you up and inside the castle passing tableaus playing out the story of Snow White, eventually reaching a courtyard at the top. Some of the rides are not dissimilar to those in other parks - the carousel, Peter Pan's Flight but overall there is a distinctly different feel. The SingalongaFrozen was a joy to behold. Hearing very familiar songs with Chinese lyrics was a real novelty. The cast were relentlessly cheerful.The Tron ride looks amazing. Sadly a bad back prevented me from sampling it but it is housed in a spectacular structure which allows you to watch the terrified participants speed past you. This whole area has been designed with great flair. Perhaps the most impressive sight of the day came within the Captain Jack's stunt show. The show started within the holding area. Lots of slapstick humour and action but then we proceeded into the Theatre area. More humour and fights and the arrival of Captain Jack with just the right amount of swagger. The safety curtain disappeared to reveal an impressive set where several spectacular fights and stunts took place but then, when the ""storm"" hit came the highpoint. Indoor Skydiving equipment enabled the stuntmen to have a battle in midair. The controlled flow of air allowed them to move up and down and even land gracefully on the high rigging of the ship. Very impressive - do not miss it. And they do it every half hour!! Sadly I had to leave before the big parade. There was a huge queue of taxis ready to take me away but my taxi driver still had some difficulty finding the way out. Hopefully this will get better in time.  This is a park with great potential. There are still occasional technical hitches - the show in front of the Castle had to be abandoned at one point when Elsa failed to come up out of the floor - but these are just teething problems. The two on-campus hotels looks impressive. I will certainly be back when next I am in Shanghai."
1275,4.0,Oct 2016,"London, UK ",Generally a great day,Visited with our 2 boys (9 and 12). Arrived just before 8am in order to 'beat the queues'. The park is lovely and designed in true Disney fashion. We went straight to Tomorrow Land to go on the Tron ride which was AMAZING. By 9am we'd been on Tron twice and the Buzz Lightyear ride...unfortunately after this point the park was rammed! We queued for the Pirates of the Caribbean for about 40 minutes (worth it though as it was the most brilliant digital multimedia simulator)...after that rides were almost impossible to get on without an hour queue. The problem here was that the fast pass queues were almost as long as the rides themselves. Disney's fast pass system here just doesn't work and we became quite frustrated. That said we visited the Wolfgang Puck restaurant in the Disneytown area (accessible by leaving the park) for an early lunch and we're pleased that the meal cost about half of a similar Puck restaurant in Downtown Disney restaurant in Florida. As a family we're seasoned Disney park visitors and Disney Shanghai was good and I'm sure will expand and become great! 
1276,5.0,Oct 2016,Highlands Ranch ,Well done Disney!!,"What a fantastic nod to the Chinese people and their culture. Everything about this park is distinctly Chinese. The architecture, the food, the layout....all of it! My wife and I spent a few days here and loved every minute of it.  There is very little western food (turkey legs and corn dogs) so be prepared. Main Street has been replaced by Mickey Ave and the castle is huge! The two best rides are Tron and Pirates. Pirates will blow your mind, we ride it three times. The fast pass system is a bit quirky so pay attention to that!! "
1277,4.0,Sep 2016,"Reading, UK ",Great day out,"If you arrive early you can do all of this park in one day. Some rides have long waits so try and use the fast pass system, however the que for fast passes can be large. It's worth staying for the fire works they are one of the best I have seen Disney do"
1278,5.0,Sep 2016,"Berlin, NJ ",The happiest place on earth ... Shanghai edition,"At the last minute, I was given a ticket to enter the park at no cost to me. In Shanghai on business, naturally I grabbed the opportunity to go!It's exactly what you'd expect from Disney -- very family friendly and very clean. There were less concessions than I remember being in Orlando, but that could be a cultural adjustment. The lines were long, but when aren't they? For dinner, we ate a food court type place. We all got Mickey shaped pizzas and they were pretty good. With a drink, they cost about 13 USD. Not a bad deal at all! The highlight of the day was riding TRON, which is not at any other park. So much fun!There is Disneytown right outside the park, with a great Disney shop, LEGO store, and Cheesecake Factory. DEFINITELY GO IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY!"
1279,3.0,Sep 2016,N/A,Fun but disappointing 3.5 stars,"As Disney had hoped, the Shanghai Disneyland is definitely Authentically Disney and Distinctly Chinese. There are the Disney hallmarks such as the afternoon parade and the Cinderella castle, or Fantasy-themed park. They even have a Disney town that has restaurants and cafes, outside of the park. Then there are uniquely Chinese elements like the 12 Chinese zodiac animals and old Shanghai interpretations of Minnie Mouse. It's definitely worth a visit both as a local living in Shanghai and a visitor coming from afar. Being the newest built Disneyland in the world, I was impressed by the newest movie additions like Madhatter's Tea Party (maze) and the Frozen characters. I found the Mulan emphasis in the stores and the night firework/lazor show a bit much, but it was nonetheless a unique Disney experience in China. Having said all this, I would have given the Shanghai Disneyland 4.5 stars just from the looks of it.The reason why I was so disappointed was because of the service staff and the performing staff. Having been to both Disney parks in Florida and California, the least I expected was to feel the enthusiasm and excitement for Disney from the ground staff. But the most I got was an annoying dart of a glance or a second of their attention after enduring some very rude and unprofessional looks. I understand that this is China and that under normal circumstances it is not easy to train the staff to be professional. However, I expected nothing less than perfection from Disney and I was highly disappointed in this regard. The performing staff also didn't look very happy or fantastical in their performance-many of them barely smiled and just looked tired.On a different note, I guess this park was created mainly to cater to the Chinese, but as a non-Chinese visitor, I found it very difficult to follow the performances without any English scripts or subtitles. I wonder if Disney has considered this.Tip #1: Visit on a weekday, avoiding major holidays, preferably when it's a bit rainy. Otherwise, prepare yourself for extremely long waits and chaotic crowds.Tip #2: Don't be shocked when you see the squat toilets in the bathrooms. There are usually some sitting toilets at the far ends of the stalls.Tip #3: Plan your meals at Disneytown. It doesn't take long to walk out from the park and they have cheaper and a better variety of options. There's pretty much just overpriced Chinese (not that great) food in the park."

1283,5.0,Sep 2016,"Hong Kong, China ",Disneyland 2.0: Latest Technology and Pop Culture,"While Shanghai Disneyland lacks the magic that's more apparent in other Disneyland(s), there's no doubt that this park has a magic on its own. The rides are non-classic; rather based on contemporary and modern culture rather than the original ones like in other parks.Behavior-wise, I understand if people aren't okay with that. There were a lot of line-cuttings. Nevertheless, I applaud Disney's security team for trying their best to control the situation. On the day of my visit, I saw at least 10 people thrown out of the line because they tried to cut the line or saved a spot for the others. Talk about seriousness."
1284,4.0,Oct 2016,N/A,Pirates of the carribean was amazing!,Went with the family for the day had a great time at disney. Highly recommend pirates of carribean because of shorter waits (mine was 15 minutes) and get a fast pass for tron earlier in day and then either fastpass for soarin or rapids ride cause those get pretty clogged up. They did an amazing job with pirates ride. Mix between boat ride and ride with giants screens that add great effect. Have great time!
1285,5.0,Sep 2016,"Denver, CO ",Great to visit after a Chinese holiday,"We visited Shanghai Disneyland the Sunday after days off for the Autumn Moon Festival, when most people were back at work and school. The park was virtually empty! We were able to take the Tron ride back-to-back with shorter than five minute lines. The same was true for the Buzz Lightyear, Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, and almost all of the other rides. The longest line was for Soaring Over the Horizon, which was 15 minutes. Pirates of the Caribbean was closed for repairs, which was a bummer. The Pirates of the Caribbean show had a great fight scene that made it worth watching, even if you don't speak Chinese (don't want to spoil the surprise with more details). If you can afford it, dinner at the Royal Banquet Hall in the castle was a gourmet feast with a prix fix three course meal of appetizer/salad, main course, and dessert. Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Daisy all visit the tables dressed as royalty. Service was outstanding as well. The Enchanted Storybook walk was truly stunning, and the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique could not have been cuter with their styling for boys and girls - the sparkles from the wands were a favorite! The park needs more time to add other attractions, but the beautiful grounds and existing rides make for a great adventure on not so crowded days."
1286,5.0,Sep 2016,"Ballarat, Australia, ",Love it!,"Only had one day in mid September, and would love to get back sometime. The crowds were not large, and I rode Tron 5 times, which is what I'd mostly wanted to try. 'Pirates' was closed for the day, but we saw the Jack Sparrow Stunt Spectacular, and it doesn't matter at all that it's in Chinese, it's great fun and very clever! Peter Pan is the same as the DL one, but easier to get on to, especially as it has a FP. The Chinese don't seem to be keen on the Star Wars franchise, so I got my photo taken with R2D2, Darth Vader (who spoke wheezy Chinese- very funny!) and in the Millennium Falcon. The Castle Walk-through is beautiful- a bit hands-on story of Snow White, and not just for the princess lovers.     The park was spotless, and there was very little line crashing, which I'd been warned about.  I think it's a good park for Disney fans, with a mixture of same and new to keep most people happy."

1289,5.0,Sep 2016,"Shanghai, China ",Amazing day at Disney,"We went there expecting a theme park, but what we got was a fantastic day and night!  The Pirates of the Caribbean area was so much fun for my 4 year old, and the ride, while starting out slow, blew up to a full cinemagraphic  3d experience that makes you feel like you're on the actual ship!  My son was a bit scared, but at the end, wanted to ride it again.  The Tarzan show is an acrobatic experience, and the Frozen show is an interactive sing-along.  The fantasyland rides are definitely more for the kids, not so exciting for adults, though there is a roller coaster there that kids might find a bit scary the first time.  The cast members there are all smiles, and most are bilingual.  If they're not, they'll quickly find one who is.  Overall, it wasn't even that expensive of a day out. There's no extra hidden costs for the shows or rides.  Even the food isn't that expensive, surprising for Shanghai in general, though we did find that not all of them were open at all times.  If you're coming from outside Shanghai, to experience the whole park, you'll need more than one day."
1290,5.0,Sep 2016,"Frisco, TX ",Much improved from opening!,"We recently returned twice to Shanghai Disneyland since going within the first month of opening and the good news is that the park has taken all the feedback and turned it into improvement!Most recent observations:- Crowd control is much better. There must be a continuing education program because the line management and general feel is much much better. Much less pushing, very little cutting in lines and constant warnings to let the kids be in front to have a better view.- Staff has more consistent English. Again, with improved training, every Disney employee was able to speak English at least in a limited way.- Lines are SHORT! Compared with Tokyo, the lines at Shanghai Disney are short .... when we went, most were under 20 min for the entire day.A few additional tips:- Wednesdays and Sundays have the shortest lines. I took my 3 children on a Sunday and we did EVERY ride in the park ... and the ones we liked several times. This means that you can do the park in 1 day, if you pick a day with short lines.- Download the app in the Apple store. It tracks line times and helps with overall planning. Well updated and intuitive.- For the Pirates ride, pick the left most line. Everyone goes down the center and the left line goes to the same place.- Try to eat lunch before 12 or after 1:30. Those familiar with Chinese culture know that 12-1 is lunch.... and it is almost religious. - Bring a stroller for shorter legs - its a large park- Get to the park early. They say it opens at 9 am but the gates seem to be always open at 8:30 am. That is at least 3 - 4 rides worth since the park is empty!Disney pulled out all the stops for this park. The rides have all the latest technology all working together (eg roller coasters + robotics + high def projection + IMAX + water aspects). Now that the opening pains are behind them, I strongly suggest this as a great Disney experience!"
1291,5.0,Jul 2016,"London, UK ",Shanghai Disneyland:  5 Reasons To Go If You are A Disney Fan,"Our family just got back from 5 days in Shanghai Disneyland.   So, the family consensus from my husband, my two children and myself is that this is the second best Disney in the world.  The fact that we can make this assessment tells you that we have actually been to every Disney in the world.  It doesn’t tell you that we have been to Disney Paris more than 40 times (we lived in Paris) or that we went to Hong Kong Disney more than 30 times (we lived in Hong Kong) or that we spend at least 1 week a year at Walt Disney World (vacation house there).   So while I never really expected to find myself being able to say this, we are pretty well versed in the Disney Parks.   Each park has something special and unique about it to recommend it:  some parks are better for certain age groups, some are better due to proximity to other attractions, etc. etc.    Walt Disney World has been sort of the pinnacle of the Disney Park experience, mainly due to size, scope and organization.  But Shanghai Disney runs a close second, at least for our family, for the following 5 reasons. 1)	The New Rides:  If you are “into” theme park rides, and I am assuming that you must be if you have read this far into this review, then you simply cannot miss the new “Pirates of the Caribbean” here.  I can feel some of you rolling your eyes right now.  But this ride is NOT the typical “Pirates” ride that you have encountered at the other parks.  It has a lot more in common with “Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey” than it does with “Peter Pan”.    This new Pirates is technologically breath taking…literally.  There are moments when the technology so tricks your senses that you get light headed or breathless.   You sink beneath the ocean in your “ship”.  You rise back up to the surface to be blasted at by cannons.   You see Capt. Jack, Davy Jones and various members of his crew.  I won’t spoil it by saying too much, but it is really exceptional and you will only find it at Shanghai Disney.  I should also mention that this coming from a woman who may be the only member of the movie going public that did not like the Pirates of the Caribbean movies.    “Tron Lightcycle Power Run” and “Roaring Rapids” are the two other “unique” rides to Shanghai Disneyland.  Tron Lightcycle is fast and fantastic.  It is the only ride I have been on where one actually assumes the position one would take on a motorbike on the ride itself.  It has a strong kick at the beginning and a half inversion.  It’s not for little kids, but little kids would be prevented from riding due to height restrictions.  The downside is that you have to store your stuff in a locker before hand and that is a bit taxing.  Also, the ride is fairly short.    Roarin Rapids is a great ride for a hot climate Disney.  There is more splashing than in most water rides and a bit of a surprise monster in the belly of the mountain.  The line, although fairly horrific in terms of time, was surprisingly pleasant as there were many fans placed at key positions.    Both these rides have very long wait times, so use the Fastpass system.   You have a shot at decent wait times if you go during lunch, parades and fireworks.Another unique attraction of this park, although not a ride, is the Alice and Wonderland Maze.  There are three different paths that lead you to the Mad Hatters tea party at the end.  But what is cool is that many of the images are from the Tim Burton version of “Alice”.   This gives things a nice twist.  The other positive is that there is one way out and one way in.  This is good if you are worried about losing your kids. 2)	The Shanghai Disney Hotel:  One of the real treats about going to a Disney park in China is that you can actually stay at the hotel without the sticker shock often associated with Disney Hotel’s in other parts of the world.  For example, to stay at the cheapest room in the premier Disneyland Hotel in Paris during the cheapest season will cost you 600 euros per night.  We stayed at the Concierge level of the premiere Disney Hotel in Shanghai for roughly half that amount.  In addition to that, we got a level of service that I have only found in Asia.   I have severe dietary restrictions and no one had any problems with this at the hotel.  In fact, the prepared special snacks for me in the afternoon without prompting.   Everyone smiles.  Everyone tries to speak English with you…to greater and lesser degrees of success.  But the key is the positive attitude. 3)	The Cultural Ambience:  While Shanghai Disney is really a Disney, they have incorporated lots of Chinese culture into the park.  From the food to the Garden of the Twelve Friends to the inclusion of Mulan as a major feature in parades.  But there is more to cultural ambience than simply what is planned by Disney.  While we were at the park, numerous people asked to take pictures of our children because my youngest is fair and blonde.   Little girls tried to talk to him.  No one was pushy about it.  No one was obnoxious.   Everyone was just friendly.  And speaking of positive behaviour,  I feel I should address something that made headlines in several papers.  There was a lot of noise made in the press about the fear that Chinese visitors would not know how to “behave” at Disney and that bathrooms would be disgusting.  I can honestly say that I saw 0 incidents of that.  The bathrooms were actually cleaner than any other Disney I have visited….and paradise compared to your average public toilet in Europe.   People visiting the park didn’t act like people who visit the parks in the US or Europe…of course not, it’s China.   And that’s why you travel, isn’t it?  To see things that you don’t see at home.    Otherwise, you should just stay at home.4)	The 144 Hour Visa Free Transit Rule:  I can’t tell you the extent to which I LOVE this.  And you will probably only understand my elation if you have every tried to get a Chinese visa.  It’s the proverbial sea of red tape.  But China has seen fit to allow a visa waiver if you meet certain criteria.  First, you have to stay in the Shanghai area (I think it works for Beijing as well).  Second, you have to stay less than 144 hours (roughly 6 days).  Lastly, you have to leave and go somewhere else besides your home destination.  For example, I could not fly London-Shanghai- London.  But I could fly London- Shanghai-Anywhere else outside of China including Hong Kong and Macau- London.   This really isn’t as arduous as it might seem and it promotes seeing other areas in Asia.  We went London-Shanghai- Tokyo- Shanghai-London and that was fine.   This is a new thing that only started in January of this year and I was very nervous about not getting a visa.  But we breezed through immigration.  They even have a special line and lots of signs telling you how to get to it.    They have made it very easy to visit Shanghai Disney for a typical 5-day stay.5)	The Comfort and Familiarity of Disney as a “Home Base”:  For those who have never visited China, or Mainland China, this is a great way to ease yourself into it.  Disney provides a safe “home base” from which you can explore a little of Shanghai while you are visiting Disney.  We took a tour to a water village just outside of Shanghai.  We spent the day looking at temples, seeing markets, eating local food and even learning to cook dumplings.  It was a glorious experience for all of us and made easy by both our tour guide and our sense of comfort with staying in a familiar locale.    I would encourage anyone interested in China and a fan of Disney to try this.  It’s more than worth it.At the end of this trip, I asked the boys to rank Shanghai Disney as compared with the other Disney’s around the world.  Both boys, aged 7 and 10, ranked it at number 2.  My oldest said, “You have to give Walt Disney World number one just because of their size and scope.  But if I was comparing this to the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World, Shanghai would win”.  This from a 10 year old!  So, find a cheap flight, take a chance and enjoy an introduction into China via Shanghai Disneyland."
1292,3.0,Sep 2016,"Tehran, Iran ",only for Chinese children,"I never been to other Disneylands around the world and it was the first time for me. most staff know English and that's a great advantage in China , but the park is for small children under 12 and if you are adult you won't enjoy it much , specially considering all the shows are in Chinese language and you understand nothing ! they could build more rides instead of hundreds of shops and restaurants ! be ready for long queues , sometimes 2/3 hours for a ride.

1293,1.0,Sep 2016,"Nottingham, UK ",Disappointed Disney Fan,"I have been to Disney Florida over 10 times and I am a massive Disney fan so am very disappointed I am having to write this review. It was easy to get to from the city, take line 11 metro all the way to Disney resort,from the metro station it takes about 8 minutes to walk. It took 1 hour to get through security, get tickets and get into the park, we had to queue in 3 different queues just to get in! Once in the park at 10am most fast passes had already gone and all of the top rides were 3 and half hours wait already. I can't tell you how good they are because I didn't manage to get on any! The river Rapids had the option for single riders but wasn't being used, when observing the ride nearly every raft had a seat spare very frustrating. I get that this place will be popular as it has only just opened but it seems they are more bothered about getting numbers in the park rather than guests enjoying their experience. One of the Disney employees even said too many people here today, sort it out Disney! It was very hot when we visited which is fine but there is hardly any shade, and the ice cream and water stations are few and far between. It is really hard to find anywhere as the sign posts aren't great. If I were you I would avoid! "

1295,5.0,Sep 2016,"Pereira, Colombia ",Disneyland Shanghai,"Grew up with Disneyland Anaheim. Shanghai is a much smaller park. Pirates was closed and this is only after the park was open for three months. Cannot see a good reason for this. Also, several other attractions also closed? We were able to do the whole park in 6 hours. Aside from Pirates being closed, it was still a good experience.Best for us was ""Soaring Over the Horizon."" (Flight located in Adventure Isle)"
1296,4.0,Sep 2016,"Seoul, South Korea ",Not as magical as the other Disneylands just yet,"First and foremost DIsneyland will always be a fun experience no matter how old you are or which location you are visiting, but as Shanghai Disney is only about 3 months old it's still ironing out some kinks. We visited on a Wednesday before a major holiday long weekend and whilst we didn't encounter 3 hour+ long waits for rides that isn't to say it wasn't a busy day. Arriving at opening we found approximately zero food options to be open other than the major restaurants or popcorn stands haphazardly located through the park. The advertised churros, turkey leg and corn dog stands were nowhere to be seen despite staff saying they had been open. Queuing does not appear to be a thing in China, at least amongst the locals. We had to stop many groups of people with no respect for other visitors from pushing past us in lines only to be greeted with huffs and puffs and probably some Chinese expletives in return. The lights/fireworks show at the end of the night was nothing short of amazing, but the amount of litter left by the disrespectful audience members was saddening. Cigarette butts could be found in toilets and throughout the park which took a little bit of magic away from the experience as well. Out of the 12 hours we were in the park for, we only saw one character walking around greeting guests (shout out to the very real looking Captain Jack Sparrow).In saying that, try the Tron ride! Easily one of the best rides in all of the Disney parks. The Seven Dwarves ride was another group favourite, as was the Tarzan acrobatics show. I have no doubt the park will further improve over time but just be aware at this early stage in it's life it's far from perfect."
1297,3.0,Sep 2016,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ",Disneyland embraces Technology,"Used a 2 day pass successfully to enjoyed all rides & attractions. Came on a Monday & Tuesday and it was not as pack as Tokyo Disneyland. Waiting times were usually 30m - 40m at most while others we used the fast pass. Yes, do try to get the fast pass for Soaring Over the Horizon the first thing when you come in. We got it on the 1st day but all FP for Adventure Land were gone by 3pm on our 2nd day. Pirates Ride is awesome with great new visual technology and the Pirates Show is cool with the use of ""skydiving technology"". In Tomorrowland, Tron is a roller coaster on a motorbike and you can wait for it for 30 mins or get the FP later in the afternoon. Tron is a must ride for SD. Other rides mimic the usual Disney offerings ie Dumbo the Flying Dragon, Horse Carousal, Peter Pan Ride, 7 Dwarfs Roller Coaster, 2 boat rides, Buzz Light Year, Jet Pack. Disney Parade is at 330pm while there are various timing for Disney Castle stage shows throughout the day. To me, the Tarzan show was acrobatic in nature and I preferred the one in Tokyo better. Lastly, the 830pm lights & fireworks show at Disney Castle is pure demonstration that SD has married modern technology + traditional fireworks into their theme park. The show was about 20 mins and be sure to get good STANDING spots.Overall, DS was made with the Chinese consumer in mind and that delivers. Of course, you got to live with the pushing, shoving, loud talk, queue cutting, smoking etc but hey, this is CHINA. When in Rome,do as the Romans do. The Disney feeling was absent for me partly because the park is too huge and they just started in mid 2016. I'm sure DS will grow to be better & better in time to come."
1298,4.0,Sep 2016,"Singapore, Singapore ",Ok visit. Try the tron roller coaster,"Had very low expectations due to the negative reviews that I have read. But it was not as bad and crowded as what people have described. The fastpass that can be collected at specified locations were useful too!There's a daily fireworks show at 8.30pm! People start crowding around to get a good spot as early as 7pm. (I think it's pointless, everyone stands up eventually, so just have a good walk and get back around the main castle by 8.30). One bad thing was all the rubbish that were left behind after the show, if only they could be more considerate.The average queue for rides was ok.. just like all other themeparks.. But people could get really close to you. Don't let that ruin your mood.Advice: 1) Get the raincoat/poncho before you enter the disneyland. They sell it at RMB10 for two. In disneyland, you will have to get it at RMB10 each. Otherwise, you could also just get wet (only one water ride).2) The mickey/minnie hairbands are cheaper too, if you don't mind the quality."

The staff is not polite, especially when you look like locals.I ordered kid meals , which was chicken drumstick and rice, and what i got was chicken breast, and when i asked for chicken drum as pictured, they just simply said that that was the meal , whether you like it or not. Even fastfood like McD or KFC alert you when they did not have what you ordered. And this disney manager in suits does not care at all.Seems that it is standard practice selling food not same as pictured, like the old chinese saying, hang lamb in the showcase but sell you dog meat."
1303,2.0,Sep 2016,"Coalville, UK, ",Disappointing Visit to Shanghai Disneyland,"I have visited all of the Disney Parks apart from Tokyo, and it is without doubt the worst park I have visited. It is very expensive for a ticket £45 for an adult and a small park compared to the others around the world. To be fair, it has the opportunity to expand as it only opened two monts ago. There are lots of dining options and the rides are good if you are prepared to queue. Also the single rider and fast pass lanes are abused as queuing is not observed in China it would seem. Another gripe is that eveyone smokes, even in the toilets, so this needs to be policed better. One of the rides broke down whilst I was on it, so that was disappointing. The weather didn't help as there were very few places to shelter, nd if you managed to find a seat, you were surrounded by smokers.The staff were very friendly and welcoming, and that was the only asset to the park.I'm pleased I visited, but I would wait a few years when the park has had an opportunity to develop."

Not so much when queuing for the attractions in the park – you are pretty much contained by guide barriers, tho’ some will still try to ‘push in front’, but at the main entrance, it did get pushy & shovey …. as it is the norm in China - be it airports, the metro, hotels, malls etc.To get there we used line 11 on the metro system ... last stop in the line is Disney.Once in, all the ingredients are there and it feels as tho’ the Disney is working its magic. If you plan it – as you should with all Disney parks - there is enough to see and do for a day …. It didn’t feel particularly busy the day we were there so we passed on fast passes.Two favourite rides and the most popular were Pirates of the Caribbean and TronShanghai Disney will grow in size and popularity so have a look now before it does."

Pirates of the Caribbean is amazing, Tron is cool and the way the Park is themed is great. The only thing that is a bit of a letdown is how the Chinese litter, they can be two feet away from a rubbish bin and still throw the trash on the ground. The cast members need to follow the other Disney Parks lead and carry the sticks to pick up the trash. We had a great time!  "

I can't believe that even children will be satisfied with the experience given the long waiting lines. Disney, Inc is really screwing the Chinese public with this facility."
1312,3.0,Sep 2016,"Singapore, Singapore ",Too crowded.  Queue too long,"The whole feel and atmosphere for Shanghai disneyland seems different from the rest of the Disneyland I have visited.  The staff at other disneylands are usually cheery and also full of smiles, but the staff at this disneyland were not like that.  No happy music greet us upon entry.  Long queue started the moment we have to clear security and bag checked.  No unsealed food and water are allowed into disneyland.  Upon clearance, we queued at a line for those that has pre-purchased tickets.  However, we had some problems and it took a while before we were given physical tickets for entry.Even though there is fast pass, the queue for these fast pass are quite long as well.  The fast pass station were centralised, hence, 2-3 rides in the same land has a centralised queue and some of these can mean queuing for 60 mins.  Fast pass were also given out even before noon, hence, we had no choice but to queue for the rides.  We spent 2 hours queuing for one ride and another 1.5 hours for another.  By then, we were quite fed up and tired.  The only ride that we enjoyed was TRON and that was the only unique ride that we have not tried in other disneyland.Frankly, I would not want to visit Shanghai Disneyland again as there is simply too many people and many too few rides to ""absorb"" the crowd.  I spent more time queuing than time spent on the rides.  Sad day.. we visited on a monday, which is supposed to be less crowded. Cannot imagine what it is like if we had visited on a weekend."

Even it is very new, we could start to see the usual Chinese lack of maintenance issues, cleanliness is also not the best. Food could be acceptable and even good depending where you have lunch. Prepare yourself for this mentally when planning to come."
1314,4.0,Sep 2016,N/A,"Very good, but with drawbacks","Overall great day out, huge park, with obvious potential to be even bigger. In coming years it will require a 3 day trip I'm sure. Perhaps lacking the happy magic feeling of other Disney parks, mostly owing to it being in China.I'll sum up positives and negatives for clarity. Pros:-Monstrous and blocky castle looks better in person than pictures. In such a huge park you kind of understand more why they wanted a huge castle, also in contains a ride that goes under it, and a very good attraction inside. -New additions are overall a success. Tron ride is stunning, but very short, Pirates update is really impressive. The adventure challenge is incredible too. -Some of the Restaurants design is fantastic, especially Barbosa's, Il Paparino ice cream, and Pinnochio's restaurant. And Ratatouille bakery. -Overall park detail is very good, esp for such a huge place. -No main street but Mickey Av replacement a huge success, looks great. Cons-The staff. It's China. And service is about the same as it is everywhere else, only just slightly better. Many of the staff look like they're bored, bolshy or unhappy. Very strange. Nothing like Tokyo parks. They're also too serious. -Pollution. Had to wear a mask the day we went as the pollution was in the red. Normally Shanghai is better for pollution but you never know on the day you go. -Queues. The fairly limitd big ride numbers mean the things the Chinese like (rapids and soaring) get huge queues right now. About 3 hours at times for Rapids. -The ridiculous system in the morning of letting people into Mickey Av, putting a rope up, then dropping it causing a stampede. It's dumb, dangerous, and scary for many people. -Common sense is lacking in many areas. On some attractions you have to queue twice. Once to use the locker, and again for the ride. This causes drama because people skip the lines. Why couldn't they just put the bag holding area by where you get on the ride like in other parks? In Tron there's a ridiculous complicated system of automatic code generated lockers. -The food. Sadly coming from the fantastic array of quality and cheap food at the Tokyo parks, the food is overhwhelmingly Chinese and fairly expensive. I don't get why every restaurant has to have Chinese food. -Some of the forced ""Chinese"" elements thrust onto the park just seem insecure and pointless. The Gardens of Imagination is fairly lame. The giant Chinese restaurant is ludicrous. The absence of Mulan is strange. -The castle. I said it was good, but you still can't get away from the fact it doesn't feel right. It's a behemoth. There's nothing that magical about it. You could probably find a similar thing in another Chinese theme park to be honest. If being extra picky I'd say it looks a bit fake and cheap, something like the modern materials used maybe.-The pushing in lines. It wasn't too bad, but some Chinese just get pushy and agitated in lines. Many just feel the urge to try to get ahead constantly. The Q for pirates we were surrounded by people trying to push ahead of us. -Tommorowland seems a bit bare and unfinished, esp in the restuarant. -DisneyTown is not great, looks like any other bland Chinese shopping complex you see everywhere. Lego store is very good though, as is the Big Disney strore near the entrance."

This greatly reduced the wait times. We were told that the park had about one-fourth of the visitors that it normally has on weekends. Our friend gave us a great suggestion. When the park opens, move quickly to the back of the park. Start in the Pirates of the Caribbean rides first. You can get a lot of rides in early, while most of the visitors are up front fighting to get selfies by the castle. The lines were fast, especially with the use of the speed passes. The animatronics, the special effects, and detailed scene construction was incredible. Of course, given that the park is in Shanghai, the performances were in Chinese. Something to consider if you don't speak the language. The food was expensive and not that great. There is a Cheesecake Factory in the shopping area that I wish we would have seen before eating in the park. The Star Wars and Marvel exhibits were quite small, but great if you want photos with Captain America, Darth Vader, and Kylo Ren. All in all, it was great. We missed the Tarzan and Frozen shows. The first two Frozen shows were cancelled. We just ran out of time for Tarzan. Otherwise, we hit everything else. I would recommend it, but go on a school day during the week.

Biggest complaint is the Fastpass system, if you arrive super early it is helpful to pick up FP for either Soaring or Roaring Rapids, otherwise they are all gone within 30 minutes of opening and >120 min wait.  We later spent 40 minutes in line for FP in fantasyland which was a total waste of time in the heat as we had already ridden the only 3 FP attractions offered in the area with minimal waits. Also not impressed with the food, overpriced, crowded, not very good quality and minimal table-service offerings (though we could have gone out to Disneytown). I saw a little bit of queue jumping but not too much and staff often sent people to back of line. Occasional smoking in crowds which was annoying but not unexpected.For those looking to avoid the lines, this was our general touring plan.  We took the Metro which was about 70 minute trip.  Arrived to the park by 7:30 (park was scheduled to open at 9) and there was already a relatively big line for security, however they did not start letting people through until 8 am.  By 8 the line was huge so we were glad we had arrived when we did, it still took us 15 minutes to get through but any later would have been much longer.  We had bought tickets in advance and was easy to pick up at main entrance.  Park opened at 9 but they had rope drop at 8:30 - the crowd at that point was massive and seemed everyone ran straight to the FP in Adventure Isle for either Soarin or RR.  This was actually quite scary and dangerous and I did see a couple people fall and nearly get trampled.  Use caution if have little kids, or elderly! Our FP return time for Soarin was 11:15 despite being early in line, and by that point the wait time for RR was already 60 minutes so we skipped over to Fantasyland which was nearly empty.  We basically walked on to both 7 Dwarfs and Peter Pan (and still no one at all in line after we had finished), then went to Tron which only had 15 min wait.  Note that by 10 the line for 7 Dwarfs was posted at 120 minutes.  Back to Fantasyland for Winnie the Pooh and Voyage to Crystal Grotto (not worth more than a 10 minute wait IMHO).  We then did Soarin with Fastpass (still had about 30 minute wait time).  So by 11:30 we had already been on 6 attractions with relatively minimal waiting.  Pirates was not scheduled to open until noon (check the daily times guide).  We walked by around 1 and it looked like it had opened briefly but was closing down again.  But at 2 we passed by again and it was now open with 30 minute wait time, we also went back to ride a second time around 7, again with 30 minute wait.  Definitely worth the time (and longer).  We spent the rest of the day eating, visiting smaller attractions, shopping, watching Tarzan show (excellent), and eventually stayed for nighttime fireworks.  The show was great but recommend arrive very early for good spot, otherwise difficult to see everything."
1322,5.0,Aug 2016,"Sydney, Australia ",Disney Fans - Just beautiful,"We are real Disney tragics. We went for 4 days and stayed at the park (We have been to Shanghai before though and it is a great city - brilliant architecture and food, but don't drink the water outside Disneyland unless it is bottled and you use a straw) We had a great time in the park and have booked flights for next year in July. It was super hot in the park - around 40 degrees celsius. We did a private tour, which cost the price of a small country, on the first day, but this got us 6 hours of going through fastpass lines with our guide and we got to go on everything and see all shows. We found it easy to go on Tron every day -everyone seemed to want Soaring and Rapids so we went over to the fastpass for Tron first thing, got that and then went on Buzz Lightyear a couple of times (Buzz is so high  tech and makes all of the others in the world look so outdated - digital targets!!!!) Pirates is not pirates as you know it, if you are a disney nerd like me. I don't want to ruin it for you but it has the same name and that is where it stops. There is no fastpass so check the lines on the App (Free wifi in the park people yay!)  It is the best ride in Disney in the world at the moment I think. It does what Ratatouillein Paris was trying to do. Tarzan show was brilliant (huge auditorium and cool on Summer days ) and we saw it 4 times and the stunt show was cute- but not really as much fun for us- but you must do it. The upgrade to technology in the Peter Pan ride should be noticed - amazing and smooth. Tron is sublime! Of course super smooth and brand new. Great photo opportunities as you take off. Buy the photo pass card which lets you access the APP but it will take some time to work out. Food and drinks are excellent. Mainland China is renowned for food handling issues and there has been a lot of publicity about the safety protocols and I ate food in the parks all day every day and I didn't get sick for the first time ever in Mainland China. Ice in drinks is even fine! We stayed int he Disneyland Hotel and said G'day to the head chef in one of the elevators (2 Aussies! Hmm that and there was Aussie beef pie on the menu in a few shops in the park hmmmmm :)) Just a great magical experience. The photo pass photographers were excellent and had so much fun with us and we got some cool photos which they put digital signage on too. Meeting characters was excellent - no lines for any really. We had photos with Duffy every day!"
1323,3.0,Aug 2016,N/A,Early days,Disneyland is always a blast but Shanghai Disneyland has too many visitors with not enough attractions.
1324,5.0,Aug 2016,"Denver, CO ",Tron is one of the best rides in the world,All we have to say about Disney experience that plan on waiting and make sure to ride Tron or get your Fastpass ASAP then Head directly over to Pirates Ride. We went on a Tuesday and there were still waits up to 230 minutes but for our opinion Tron and Pirates are the best at Disney by far. You will not get to ride everything there with the crowds but you will want to make sure to rides these or you will be missing out. Fireworks show was not really all that. More like a showcase of Disney movies on the castle. 
1325,5.0,Jul 2016,"Glasgow, UK ",Shanghai Disney,"Had a great day. A few teething problems with rides, but it's early days. You must ride Tron, it's amazing, just too short. Pirate ride also amazing. Staff friendly and helpful with good English. The castle is enormous, I believe the biggest one in any Disney Park. Can't wait to go back. Would love to go at night to see it all lit up. Only small point is food is pretty expensive inside the park. I'd recommend you eat as you leave the park in Disney Town. Better choice of restaurants and better quality of food."
1326,3.0,Aug 2016,"Tunja, Colombia ",Beautiful but crowdy,Average time for a ride: 1 hr. Too much!!  Children love it but you always wonder if such amount of money is worth for lining up the most of the time...
1327,3.0,Aug 2016,"London, UK ",SO BUSY,I did expect large queues but this was ridiculous and probably made worse because of the crazy heat and humidity. Sadly all fast passes were sold out so we literally went on two rides and had to leave we were dripping with sweat. The Tron ride is amazing I would go there again just to go on that 
1328,3.0,Aug 2016,"Tacoma, WA, ",Some growing pains but overall a success.,"I've been to both American parks several times, this was my first visit to the new park in Shanghai. Pros: - very clean -  food was not only reasonably priced ( about $2.25 usd for a great iced tea with plenty of ice. Bottled water is even less.- many park workers know some English and all were willing to help- taking Shanghai metro to/from the park was easy and cheap. The subway station is a short walk to park entrance. Not like having to take boat or monorail to get from your car to entrance in Disney World in Orlando.Cons: - lines for security getting into park were extremely long. How about banning outside food so you don't have to tear apart every bag. Some people were carrying in garbage bags filled with food and bottled water.- fast pass lines and single rider lines not in use at every attraction- how about some installing some misters to help keep people waiting in extremely long lines cool.Tips: - as with every Disney Park, go early!! Park opens at 8am. Lines are prohibitively long by 10am. You even have to wait in a long line for a fast pass.- do your shopping after you're done riding and the World Disney store located in Disneytown has a much better selection than the rather small and crowded shops on Mickey Avenue ( Main Street) inside the park.- The Pirates of the Carribbean was our favorite ride, although we didn't get a chance to see Tron.- Have fun and be patient. Lines are long and many Chinese people were rude and pushy, more so than our experiences in America."
1329,3.0,Aug 2016,"Doha, Qatar ",Good but to crowded and hot in August ,"As usual, all Disney park are as expected, very good parks and attractionsCouple of observations There should be any privilege for people who are staying in any of the Disney hotel, I didn't get any benefit Fast pass should be available in app and not machines, I wasted my time in long que only for the machines and after 3 pm most of them where closed Because of it, I only had the chance to get one fast pass only and I did a que of 3 hours for one of the most popular attractions, considering the volume of people that this park is managing, it should be improved Maybe need to think to expand some attractions it is one of the most crowded parks I've visited "
1330,4.0,Aug 2016,"New Delhi, India ",Did not enjoy...too hot and long queues,"Went there with my 7 month daughter and wife! Has lot of expectations as this is brand new and we have been to Paris Disney before.reaching there is quite convenient ,take line 11 Nd another 15 min walk to main gate.There s a family mart at metro exit,pick your drinks and snacks,if you don't want to pay 5 times the price if same stuff inside.We had bought tickets onlineso entry to the park was pretty smooth.Actual ordeal started after that,,,Yes,I am saying it ordeal as if was too hot there.Moreover,for every main ride there is queue for 1 hr to 2hrThus you stand in scorching heat for 2 hrs to get 15 min ride. Y the time you co,pad out is completely exhausted without any enthu for more ridesSome tips:reach early by 8 am,try to come in winters,take fast pastor the best ride as soon as you reach the park!"
1331,5.0,May 2016,"Hong Kong, China ",An amazing replica of the American theme park,"We were invited as VIP guests to visit Shanghai Disneyland during its soft opening in May, 2016.  This place claims as the largest and newest addition to the Disney family worldwide.  When we arrived that morning, it was raining hard, there is a long walk from the West Parking Lot to the entrance, about 5 to 6 street blocks distance.  No shade or cover, it could be a problem for hot summer days or raining days like the day we visited.It is after all, built from last addition to Hong Kong at least 10 plus years, the computer technology, the audio visual equipment's advancement, made the attractions so wonderful, breath taking experience!  We have been all the Disney establishment worldwide, (except the Paris), we found no difference here in Shanghai with any other Disney amusement parks, family oriented, full of healthy fun. Only difference is this one is brand new, and the park is big in size.  That day we understand probably hosted about 40,000 tourists, but I do not feel the space is crowded, or any attraction has super difficult to get on.As this is said soft opening period, some of the program, like the show ""Lion King"", and roller coaster for some reason cannot operate, which is understandable.  There are so many places to go, to see, and you cannot see them all, so we still had a good time even without experiencing these attractions.  If you want to experience all the attractions, it should take you two to three days.For those budget conscience people, they do allow you to take reasonable quantity of unopened bottled drinks or sandwiches are in original seal (not opened or half consumed), or the original pack of cookies, etc.  The concession restaurants inside sells food at about 2 to 2.5: 1 compare to the outside price level.  However, they provide a very wonderful dining atmosphere, and the food is not that bad.  Certainly, it is cheaper than the food sold in Hong Kong Disneyland.We enjoyed the light and firework show as a nice touch to finish the day.  The show is flawless and quite long, get your ticket worthy."
1332,5.0,Aug 2016,"Kathmandu, Nepal ",Great experience!!!,"If you are visiting the Disneyland in Shanghai then be prepared for a big crowd with long queue for each ride. Try to take the fast pass as soon as you enter and plan in advance what rides you want to take.Our overall experience was amazing. The Tron ride is a must. It was the highlight of our trip. Don't miss the Tron ride !!! Another one is the Pirates ride and the show (even though the show is in Chinese, it's a fun watch). Also the nighttime Ignite the Dreams firework at the castle and the Mickey's storybook parade are a must for Disney lovers.The sad part is, after a spectacular Disney experience, you walk back stepping on plastic covers and bottles thrown all over the grounds of the park. There are so many dustbins located at the park. However, people just throw them on the ground and really don't care about doing it. Hope they take improvement measures in this part."
1333,5.0,Aug 2016,"Singapore, ",Too hot. But still a good trip ,"1. Arrived at 8am - took us half an hour to walk into the park and half an hour to get through the queues into the main entrance. Lucky we came when we did as queues did get longer and by that time the app told us the queue at Soaring was already 60 minutes.  (At 8.10am) 2. From the park to walk to adventure land and find a ride that didn't have an hour queue was also about half an hour. It was so hot and difficult because park is so big. Was so grumpy by then 3. Park - water spots and toilet spots so far apart. Walk, walk, walk and not enough water - could see people having Heat stroke etc. One can really be sick especially if queuing in the heat. 4. All the key rides had queues throughout the day in excess of 1 hour. It never abated even at 6.30pm and by then so tired couldn't stay. And queuing in the hot sun really wasn't one of them. Having said that it was a great trip. 1. To avoid the queues we went majority for the shows which were in very cold air-con. The queues were much shorter and the entertainment value was very high. Disney is a great story-teller. Having foreign-accented Chinese for the key actors in the Frozen show was a bit off-putting though. 2. Food court - good portion food. Full-blast air con. And surprisingly queues were okay. 3. People were okay; like anywhere else in the world. But the smoking in line irritated me a little. "
1334,3.0,Aug 2016,"Haifa, Israel ",The park is high quietly but....,"I went the Disneyland 2 weeks ago and it was august in China very hot during the summer. We found ourselves spending 6 hours in waiting in huge queues.If  you want to go , but do it in the winter"
1335,5.0,Aug 2016,N/A,Don't miss tron ride,"Its good to be there, rides are awsm but be careful of time, you can buy ticket from disneyland shanghai application and try to buy ticket in mon, tues, wed, thurs only because there are too many people in weekend. "
1336,5.0,Aug 2016,"Los Angeles, CA ","Bravo, Disney!","First, I am going to begin my review with the fact that no theme park experience is going to be perfect, especially ones at parks that have only been open for a few months and are located in a country where one does not live. Yes, some attractions had very long lines. Yes, it was very hot and humid at the park. And yes, some guests displayed behavior with which we are not familiar in western countries, but, overall, Disney has done a wonderful job to surmount these hurdles and provide a magical and memorable experience for guests.  We stayed at the Shanghai Disneyland Hotel, which was opulent and beautiful. The service was excellent- true Disney hospitality! Cast members always said hello and asked to assist us with anything that we needed. We also stayed on the concierge level and had access to the Magic Kingdom Club, which serves complimentary breakfast, snacks at afternoon tea time, beverages and snacks at ""Happy Hour,"" and hors d'oeuvres and desserts in the evening. The staff in the concierge were incredible. They were knowledgable about the park, willing to assist us in purchasing tickets when we opted to return to the park for a third day, and recommended places for us to visit in downtown Shanghai. It was well worth staying on property. The park was fantastic for having just opened a few months ago. We purchased our tickets before we left for China. All we had to do was show our confirmation number and provide a passport at the park's entrance. We arrived at the park at 8:00, so that we could go through the security line. Then, we waited in line to get our park tickets.Many people have recommended getting a FastPass for Soarin' Over the Horizon upon entering the park. Since we have been on this ride at Disneyland, we decided to immediately go to Tron. This is a ride that you do not want to miss. I recommend arriving at the park early and waiting in the stand-by or single rider line. We waited for about twenty minutes, and the queue was located indoors in the air conditioning. The ride is definitely one of the best that Disney has built and will satisfy any roller coaster junky's craving for speed.I would also recommend going on the Buzz Lightyear ride, even though it is present at other parks. Disney has improved this attraction- one can see the laser being shot from his or her gun, the targets are clearly visible, and one knows when he or she has hit a target. I was actually able to earn over one million points and earn the coveted title of Galactic Hero!Unfortunately, Pirates of the Caribbean was closed during our visit, so I am unable to comment on that attraction. The Pirates of the Caribbean stunt show, as well as the Tarzan show, were excellent and exciting, and they provided a much-needed escape from the heat. Pirates is in Mandarin, but it was still an exciting show. The acrobats in the Tarzan show were very talented and exciting to watch!Other attractions only found at Shanghai Disney Resort included Voyage Through the Crystal Grotto, which is a boat ride that sails through the castle, which is absolutely stunning, by the way; Roaring Rapids, which is almost the same ride as Grizzly River Run in CA Adventure; and Pooh's Honey Pot Spin, which is basically the same ride as the Teacups ride, except in that it uses honey pots for ride carriages. There is also a ropes course, where guests are strapped into harnesses and can choose an easy, medium, or difficult trail. I did the difficult trail, which involved walking on a rope without wooden planks for much of the course. It was exhilarating! We also did end up getting FastPasses for Soarin', due to the fact that the tickets for Roaring Rapids were distributed before we made it to the distribution machines. We had waited in line for awhile, so we wanted to at least pick up some sort of FastPass. On a side note, the lines for FastPasses can be long, and some guests try to shove past others to get a spot in line. The cast members, however, did an excellent job with controlling the guests and made anyone who tried to cut the line go to the back. Bravo, Disney! The only difference between Soarin' in Shanghai and Disneyland in California is that, instead of Patrick, the flight attendant, narrating the safety video, it is a Chinese storyteller. Also, there is one more difference during the movie, but I do not want to spoil it!Now, I will talk a little bit about the food in the park. We only ate in the park for one meal, but they had options for every taste bud. Restaurants featured Chinese and Western cuisines. I tried a grilled squid entree, as I am more adventurous than other members of my family with food choices when I travel. Another member of my party was able to choose a half-chicken entree. The food was delicious, and we saw chefs freshly preparing the meals in a kitchen. There are plenty of food options!The park also has what Disney calls ""Wishing Star Park,"" which does not require a park ticket for entry. It is a beautiful lake with plenty of places to rest, as well as gardens. If you like to walk in parks, it is a wonderful walk and will take you all over their property. Disney Town is also adjacent to the theme park, and there is even a separate entrance to the park in the back of the area.The lines here are nonexistent in the afternoon. It also does not require a separate ticket, unless one wants to see the Lion King show. We ate lunch here a few times, and there are quite a few Chinese restaurants with a handful of Western restaurants. There are also clothing, toy, and accessory shops here. The World of Disney store is also quite impressive here.Finally, I will comment on the ""kinks"" that Disney is clearly working on ironing out. Some of the cast members speak very little English, but they would summon a cast member who could to help us if we had a problem. As for the garbage issue that has been mentioned, we only saw a small pile in one of the queues, but a cast member came by and quickly cleaned it up. Otherwise, the park was spotless! There were a also few unruly guests who tried to shove past us in line, but cast members were quick to move them to the back of the line. During my experience, however, it was very rare to be shoved in the queues. Finally, there are plenty of spaces to cool off. The buildings have air conditioning systems that are always running full-blast, even in the bathrooms. This was a huge relief!Overall, considering the fact that the park just opened, as well as the fact that Disney is dealing with a new place and culture to which it is catering its theme park, I would highly recommend visiting Shanghai Disney Resort. We even opted to attend the park for a third day because we enjoyed it so much! I was also pleasantly surprised to feel as if I was experiencing an authentic Disney theme park, so when Bob Iger says that the park is ""authentically Disney, distinctly Chinese,"" he is absolutely correct! Just as a prior review mentioned, I was able to see Chinese guests from all walks of life share magical moments with their family members. Children became excited when they saw the Disney characters, and their parents and grandparents seemed to beam with joy upon seeing their children and grandchildren happy and making wonderful memories. I certainly made some wonderful memories during my experience as well. I would definitely recommend visiting Shanghai Disney Resort, and I cannot wait to see what the park is like when Disney finishes ironing out some of the very small kinks currently present!"

No tickets for fast pass avaialble before lunch. All waiting times >>2h. No possibilities to sit - thousands of People sit on floor somewhere, green Areas for picknick or sitting are closed. They should have known in planning that expectation of crowd even bigger than in other parks of US or Europe - but nothing learned, same issues of non effective processes to carry over masses.

1338,4.0,Aug 2016,"London, UK ",Pirates of Caribbean better than other Disney resorts,"Predictably - it's VERY busy in August. We arrived early and went straight to get our free fast pass ride and our ticket was timed for 18:20. I'm so glad we went to the fast pass booth first. If we'd waited I'm sure they would have gone. We were there from 09:00 to 21:00 and we only had 5 rides due to the length of the queues and I think we were lucky to do this many. There was lots of queue jumping.Having been to all Disney resorts except Paris, I can say that the Pirates of the Caribbean was FAR better than anywhere else. Far more technology used. It was also quite long - around 10 minutes.Apart from that, the food was far better quality than in Florida. We had lunch at Pinocchio Kitchen (Mickey-shaped pizza - truly iconic!) and then coffee and cakes at the bakery in Mickey Avenue by the entrance. In both cases the food was pretty good and the service was extremely speedy.I would advise to go when the local kids are not on holiday but if you have no other choice August is ok, as long as you arrive early, stay late and are well organised about what rides you go on and when. I. The last hour or two it was much quieter and queues were shorter although beware, some rides close at 7pm!"
1339,3.0,Aug 2016,"Witham, UK ",Great park but prepare for the heat ,The park had all the usual disney magic with brilliant rides and shows for people of all ages.  The decoration and park design are astounding. The park is easy to access via the metro being at the end of one of the lines and the metro is very cheap (we paid about £2 per person to travel across the city to the park). The main downside is the sheer number of guests.  I'd advise arriving for park opening as this allowed us to go on several rides with no ques at the beginning of the day.  Unfortunately by around 10 am there were 3 hour waits for the big rides and 50 minutes for most of the others.  The fast pass system doesn't seem to work as these are released in batches and gone within minutes.  Waiting for rides can be difficult in up to 36 degrees celius heat and many of the lines offer no shade or fans.  I'd highly recommend taking an umbrella to provide shade as most of the locals do. The shows didn't seem to have such an issue with waiting and had plenty of seats  (even ac in the Tarzan show). The performances were very impressive so I would recommend seeing at least a few of these during the day. 
1340,1.0,Aug 2016,N/A,The worst experience in China,"My holidays were for 15 days in China. & disneyland was the worst thing happen to me in China.I hope I can review this in minus..""Trip advisor I want you to pass this review to Disney land in case they don't get it."".""Saturday (weekend) + 35•C + summer vacation""- combination of these 3 was horrible.I visited Disney world in Hong Kong. It was too nice that I decided to visit this one too. In weekends it opens at 8am. We reached at 8:25am & standing in lines. Got turn at 9:20am to get inside. So many people, hot weather & even they don't maintain lines & push each other. In this hot weather everyone is sweating like hell though they stand so near by & push & break lines.We left at 11am. Only in 2:30 hrs we left it. I visited 14 countries till date & visit entertain parks every where but this one was the worst worst thing happened to me..Minus points:(1) Disney is 'The reputed entrainment world' & they allow food from out side which decrease there business in earning money by food. People come with big trolly bags full of foods & start to eat since outside in lines, waiting lines of rides/show & even inside show...!!!😳🙄.(2) Disney is the place not only visited by locals also by foreigners but though each & every show was in Chinese. Even security people & employee of restaurant don't understand English. Subtitles of shows in Chinese & no audio devise for translation...! Too poor.. I ask for water though they don't get it & I used translator every time. That's why less than 1% foreigners I found in Disney..(3) Shanghai is the biggest city of the world by population+ tourists+ people from near Cities come to visit Disney & management was too poor. Even no security machines..!!. They check bags like they get tired & don't want to check it. Even no management of lines & security was standing like general people..! No expression & no care of so many people...!.(4) Orlando & Hongkong Disney maintained there standards at very high level & even they attract tourists all over world. .Disney I want to tell you don't let down your reputation by these types of big mistakes. We love you & maintain your standards. Because every kind of people visit this place with there kids & at some levels you have to maintain your standards."

1342,4.0,Jul 2016,"Pittsburgh, PA ","Good, but room for improvement","Some of the attractions (e.g., Pirates of the Caribbean and Soaring) were both technically advanced and a lot of fun, and the nightly fireworks are a plus. However, security and organization must be improved. People cut in line in broad daylight, which is rude and inadmissible, yet security is rarely around to maintain order. Similarly, fast passes are gone less than 40 minutes after the park opens, with loud tumors of resales of what should be free for those attending the park."

1344,5.0,Aug 2016,"San Francisco, CA ",Inspired and Awed!,"Yesterday I took my two children to Shanghai Disneyland.  My kids and I have been to Magic Kingdom LA, to Disney World in Orlando and to Hong Kong Disneyland.  We love going to Disneyland Parks.  Yesterday was by far the greatest Disney experience I have ever had.  My two kids feel the same way.  First the rides were amazing.   Disneyland Shanghai has a new caliber of rides unmatched anywhere in the world namely Tron and the new revamped Pirates of the Caribbean.  Torn was the first ride we went on and it was the most thrilling experience we've had on theme park rides. Something about the lighting, the music, and the novelty of experiencing the ride as though your riding a motor cycle.  Immediately after the ride we all agree that our park admissions fee was worth it just to be able to ride Tron.  I would easily have paid that amount just for one ride on Tron, that is how incredible the ride was.  Pirates of the Caribbean is almost a completely different ride than its sister in Orlando and LA as it involves a whole new series of technology so you almost feel like you are inside the action packed move of Pirates of the Caribbean as digital ships and Cracken swirl around you on mega 3-D curved I-max screens.  Again I would have paid the park admission fee just for one ride on the new Pirates as it was a completely new and thrilling experience.Soaring over the Horizon was also amazing, it's the same concept as Soaring over California expect it is soaring over places around the world like the Taj Mahal and Sydney Opera House, etc.  I have heard that LA Disneyland is now using this Soaring over the world format instead of Soaring over California.  There is something that happened to me on this ride that really touched me though.  The people on the ride were so happy.  There were awesome of sheer delight and amazement and a thunderous round of applause when the ride concluded.  That's when I realized that this Shanghai Disneyland is so much more than just rides, it is something much bigger and greater than that.  The beauty of Shanghai Disneyland is that it is opening the world to people who have never been able to leave China before and it is giving them a window to the world.  I was so moved that I shed a few tears.You see most of the people at the Disneyland park were not the rich Chinese we hear or read about, but rather I saw that most of the people are middle class to poorer Chinese from the rural areas of China. For many of these people they have never been outside of China and their knowledge of the world is limited. They also are people who work very hard and have not had much chance to really enjoy things we take for granted in the developed world. To see their delight as they rode on Pirates of Caribbean or learned about the world as the Soared over famous landmarks in Soaring over the Horizon, I felt a great since of appreciation that these people can have this opportunity.  This is the beginning of a developed China that isn't just about money of the rich, but rather about the common Chinese people know having opportunities to learn about the world and to experience top quality recreational opportunities.  I think Disneyland China has the capacity to inspire millions and I am so excited about this.You doubtless read about the complaints regarding some of the visitors, but I suggest you don't pay it any attention because sure many of the visitors are from the country side and have little education, but the beauty of Disney is coming to the Park is an incredible educational opportunity for these visitors.  Yes, there might be some trash discarded on the floor where people have had to wait in line, but over time they will learn to hold on to it until they can find a bin.  It's a small price to pay for experiencing a world class Disney theme park which has the potential to provide such an amazing educational opportunity to the Chinese people. About the lines, we were able to go on Tron twice, Soaring twice, Pirates twice, Peter Pan once, Seven Dwarves once, and Buzz Light-year once.  We managed to keep our line waiting to to one hour per line by arriving at the park before it opened and getting rides in first thing in the morning as well as getting our fast passes in the morning, and using the App to only go on rides that had a wait of 75 minutes or less.  We did a lot of walking and we stayed at the Park from 9am open till 9pm close.  The kids were tired but we got a lot in for one day.  From 11am to 2pm we mostly ate and avoided the sun as the rides were the longest during this period and the sun was the hottest. If you employ these strategies you can get a lot of rides in despite the park being extremely crowded, which was no exception on the day we went. At some points the line for Soaring was 240 minutes long and the line for rapids was 150 minutes almost the whole day. We decided to skip Rapids given the long lines.The park is new and so there are some glitches and things to be improved.  The first thing I noticed was when we arrived at the Park there was a 30 minute line to go through security and the line was a huge pack of people.  I think there is definitely a potential for a stampeded to occur which could lead to death or injury.  I think they need to put in more security point entrances and also make metal rails so people can stay in lines without a mass forming.  In addition they should have a separate line for people without bags as me and my kids had no bags but we still needed to wait the 30 minute line and then once we got to security they just waved us through because we had no bags.The only other glitches were sometimes rides had to be temporarily closed because of maintenance, which causes a lot of heartache if you’ve been waiting in line an hour or more, so this is certainly something I know Disney will fix.  This happened to us on Buzz Light Year, but staff gave us a return pass so we wouldn’t need to wait in line again.There is also great food in the park and in the Disney Town, which can be accessed quickly and conveniently through a back entrance in the park.   For dinner we took this exit and right outside was the Cheese Cake Factory.   The food, portions, and service was at an even higher standard than the already high Cheese Cake Factory USA standards.  It was one of the nicest Cheese Cake factory meals I have ever had with reasonable prices (it was only $50 for me and my two teenage kids).  We were back in the park immediately after because there is no line to get back in using the back entrance.The Shanghai heat is quite suppressive so I think a water play fountain area would be a good idea to help hot kids cool down.  In our case we tried to go to the indoor well air-conditioned rides as much as possible.The only other thing I will mention is the fast pass line.  I think it was a mistake for Disney to put all the fast pass machines at one distribution center for each land such as tomorrow land.  This creates long lines (sometimes as much as 40 minutes to get a fast pass) and often when you get to the machine you find there are no more fast passes available for the rest of the day for the attraction you wanted which means you have to take the other attraction fast pass or count your time that you waited in line a loss.  I think Disney should put the fast pass distributions at each attraction as they do in Orlando and LA.  The Disney employees manning the fast pass lines also need some training as they only let one person form the line to a machine which means that the machine sits empty for a few seconds as one person leaves before the next person arrives.  Also sometimes I noticed the person managing the line wasn’t aware a machine was open so it would sit empty for a minute.  I think making some improvements to the fast pass distribution system will help.These very few suggestions are just that suggestions and should not be in anyway confused with criticisms or disappointment.  Shanghai Disneyland in my opinion is  by far the best Disneyland theme Park and it will pass all the other parks in very short order for highest attendance and tickets sales and revenue, etc.  Even though we only planned to go for one day, my children have already convinced me to take them tomorrow after we have a rest today.  Way to go Disney and way to go Shanghai!"
1345,4.0,Aug 2016,"Shanghai, China ","Very long lines, get the fast pass","Be prepared to face a mountain of people as you come in, starting with the crowd in the security check. I am sorry to say that many people ask for extra money saying they have a special route, which in reality is just squeezing through the other people waiting in line. But one of the things I deem most important to foreigners is that there is no fast pass machine, and line for the fast pass may be long. I would advise to go early, get a fast pass for either soaring or the raging river, and line up as early as possible for the other one of the bunch. Tron- the fastest ride, is put up to even higher speeds during night time, and fast pass tickets run out quickly, so be sure to get them as early as possible. Of course, no meal would be without the traditional Disney turkey leg, though there is sure to be a bunch of Chinese tourists asking you where you bought them."

1348,4.0,Aug 2016,farnham ,Awesome rides but be prepared to queue,"Great to experience a brand new park however there were some downsides.Arrived at 9am ( official opening time) but park had already been open for an hour. Queued for an hour in the heat to get through security then another queue to access the park with pre booked tickets By his time all the fast pass tickets were gone. Pirates of the Caribbean - advertised as 60min wait but got on in 40 mins,  the queue was constantly moving and in the shade. Amazing underwater experience but would have been better if we had got splashed or squirted with water Soaring over the horizon - 3 hour slow moving  queue !!!!  But was totally worth it as this ride is like nothing I've experienced before . You feel like you are flying over the clouds and taken to various famous locations eg Great Wall of China. Eiffel Tower and Kilimanjaro with different scents in the air for each area to highlight the experience. Tron - this was the only ride we found  with a single rider option and we were on in 15mins ( vs 2hr for regular queue) be prepared to leave you stomach behind as it is very fast Parade - easy to get a good view of the floats and lots of interacting with the characters and dancersMickey town is an area just outside the park gates with shops and bars - recommend Chengdu bar for a very welcome drink and nachos Overall a fab fun filled day with the family "
1349,3.0,Jul 2016,"Estero, FL, ",B-minus so far,"Disney's newest park was just three weeks old when we went July 11 on a drizzly Monday, with high expectations as Orlando aficionados . We loved: *The great sophisticated effects on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride (although we were surprised by the lame last animatronic view of Jack Sparrow).*The Tarzan show, showcasing China's famed acrobatics in a theater in the round.*The Star Wars pavilion, which was virtually empty. Apparently Chinese aren't familiar with classic (we were appalled when one young teen had never heard of it), so we had our run of the pavilion and photo ops with Darth Vader, R2-D2, Kylo Ren, and the Millennium Falcon.*The evening light show, which includes Star Wars themes, and adds shooting water sprays to complement the usual lighting and fireworks.*Dashing to Soaring after the light show and being the second to last riders before the park closed.*The dim sum! A little pricey and no soy sauce about, but it's dim sum at Disney! *The great digital locker system at the front gates, allowing you access all day.*Plentiful bathrooms with plentiful western toilets vs. the squat toilets.What we didn't like (much of which has already been noted by others):*The Chinese do not know how to queue. They're not intentionally cutting--they just are accustomed to pushing, whether in line or around the park or in the bathrooms. The problem is the park didn't seem to design routing for theaters or rides to handle that problem--i.e. funneling people in one way and out another way. The pirate boat display for example was surprisingly poorly designed for crowd flow. I actually felt endangered occasionally as the hoards behind were practically stampeding when entering a dark theater. Then the same shoving occurs when leaving. *Getting inside the Cinderella Castle was a highlight, but we were disappointed there weren't more imaginative treasures (like glimpses of princesses at play or beautiful rooms). Instead it's a routed storybook experience--we got Snow White, which had some fun holographic images.*The Jack Sparrow show was dreadful. The whole process took over 90 minutes for maybe 10 minutes of clever effects. The pre-show while you're standing in the line after you've already been in line for 30 minutes, is amazingly lame and all in Chinese. We kept wondering if this was the whole show. It's not but the main show also was mostly average (though we liked the Chinese Johnny Depp). Needs an immediate revision.*The park didn't seem to plan for the kind of wet weather that is typical from June to September. The afternoon parade was canceled; much of the walkway was very slick; some of the kiosks closed up early. Transportation: The Shanghai metro is great and it was easy and cheap to ride out to Disney (an hour from the Bund.) The station offers a few shops so you can buy food and drink before the park--but you can't bring in ""opened"" food or just grapes for example. The last train leaves Disney around 10:30--and you have to make sure your connections are still running, too! So don't lollygag."
1350,5.0,Aug 2016,"Kennewick, WA ",It's Disney!,"I was in Shanghai and had a free day and decided to give Shanghai Disney a try.  I spoke with many of my local work colleagues who cautioned me not to go because of the crowds and the heat.  I had also been watching the wait times on the rides and found the popular ones to be lengthy.  BUT, I’ve been to other Disney parks before and went in with a plan and usually it worked out well for me and hey, what else did I have to do!So some background.  I went on a Sunday and it was hot and humid.  Park hours were 8AM-10PM.  I’m in my 40s and have been to other Disney Parks with my kids and not all the rides appeal to me.  I don’t do spinning rides and some of the kid rides….well are for little kids (but I jumped on some anyway).  I’m also from the US and don’t speak Chinese.  All the signage is in Chinese and English.  All park employees I encountered spoke enough English to assist me with any questions I had or give me direction.  All the shows, songs, dialog, announcements, etc are in Chinese.First, download the mobile application and create an account.  Purchase your ticket online (via the mobile app or the website), you will pick up your ticket at the main gate/turnstyle by presenting your ID or passport, however it was purchased.  It worked very well and was quick.  Plan on being there early (I was there about 40 minutes ahead of the park opening and wished I was there earlier).  I took the metro, line 11 takes you right to the park.  Once up to the Disney area, you will go thru a bag search/security, then into a large area leading up to the main gate/turnstyles.  After claiming your ticket, you will go thru to the main street where there will be people queued up waiting for the “rope drop” which happens 15 minutes before the park officially opens.  When I was there, so were a few thousand others.About the rides.  Soarin, Roarin Rapics, Tron, and Pirates all seemed to be popular with the longest wait times (I watched the app in the days leading up to my visit and I also noted that Pirates seemed to be down a lot leading up to my visit).  At the rope drop, I hurried over to get a Soarin FP, the line there took about 10-15 minutes to get the FP.  After getting that I went straight to Tron.  They have lockers where you can put your larger things (there is a small compartment on the ride to put things like sunglasses, etc).  It was 10-15 minutes in line before I was on the Tron ride and it was fun.  After exiting, I jumped on the Buzz Lightyear ride because there was no wait.  After exiting that ride I headed toward the 7 dwarfs ride, but on my way jumped on the Peter Pan ride that had no wait as well.  I got to 7D and there was a 60 minute wait, but they also had a single rider line that was only 10, so I was able to take advantage of that and knocked that ride out.  I still had time before my FP time of 10-11AM so I headed for Pirates.  The wait there showed 30 minutes.  This was by far my favorite ride.  I just felt it was entertaining, little bit of a thrill (again all in Chinese) but thought it was fun.  Now I headed over to see if I could get my next FP for Roarin Rapids but they had handed all the FP’s out for the day and they still had a 3 hour wait time on the ride.  And even though they showed a single rider line, they didn’t have it open for some reason.  So I did Soarin on my FP which I still had a little wait in the FP line but thought this ride was very well done also.So by 11AM, I had basically ridden all the rides on my list to do (except for Roarin Rapids which I didn’t want to wait for).  So I grabbed a quick snack and then decided to take in the shows.  I first went to Captain Jack Sparrow stunt show and had low expectations based on some other reviews.  There was some dialog in the “queue room” with the characters and more once the show started before they got into the action.  Remember it was all in Chinese so I didn’t know what was being said.  Despite my low expectations I thought they did a great job on the show and had some pretty cool stunts in there as well.  Well done and worth my time even if I didn’t know what they were saying.Next I hit Tarzan, which turned out to be my favorite show.  Think Cirque type show with acrobatics, juggling, etc all with the Tarzan theme.  There was no dialog (I mean really Jane is the only one that can speak right, ha) so the story played out to the Tarzan music with Chinese words and I thought they did a great job.Now it’s about 2PM and I have done everything I wanted to do, except see the light show at night.  So I went out of the park to Disneytown to sit down at a restaurant to eat a nice meal and take a break.  After I went back into the park I did some souvenir shopping and decided to check out Star Wars Launch Bay and Marvel Universe.  Still with time, I did the Alice in Wonderland Maze, Voyage to the Crystal Grotto and Winnie the Poo.  These were all really kids rides that I didn’t care for.  But then I also saw (via the app) that Pirates only had a 20 minute wait, so I went and did that one again.  I wrapped up the evening going to the Frozen Sing Along (which was well done but remember all in Chinese).Finally I went outside to watch the night show which is displayed on the castle and can be seen from many places.  I thought it was incredibly well done and worth the wait.  Disney always seems to have a way to make that spectacular.Overall, I am very glad that I went and had a great time.  I will say again it was very hot.  Well it was in the low 90s and I’m used to heat like that but it was humid and the sun felt like it was cooking my soul.  I did bring an umbrella and used it and drank a lot of water.  I also think the park could accommodate more then what I saw when I was there.  The rides maybe not so much but many eating places were not open and other then standing in line I didn’t feel crammed in there."

1352,3.0,Jul 2016,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ","A Magical Day, Waiting in a Never-Ending Line","Much like most Disneylands, Shanghai Disneyland retains the theme of the amusement park. The park is sprawling and introduces new rides based on new characters (such as Frozen). Most staff speak both English and Chinese and are extremely helpful. The food is average and reasonably priced. The rides are clean, new, well varied/maintained and extremely detailed as far as basing the rides off the storyline of the animation with a few significant downfalls.Firstly the lines in the park are horrifyingly long with waiting times ranging from 40 mins to upto 4 hours... We reached the park at about 11 a.m. and left at 9:30 p.m. but only managed 5 rides. Honestly I would recommend waiting only for the rides you really want to do and/or the ones that are different. Secondly the park is mainly in Chinese with near to no English subtitles. Some shows like Stitch's Encounter is completely in Chinese with only the safety briefing in English.The tickets are priced at 499RMB and 375RMB. There are no fast pass tickets available for purchase. However it can be pre-booked (at no cost) once in the park for specific rides only. If the fast-pass is booked, the guest is expected to be at the ride at the time allotted  in a separate fast-pass line. There is also a VIP tour present for 6 people at a time that costs around 12,000 RMB (What we were told) which includes a personal guide to show you around the park and take you through a separate line to the rides.The park can be reached via the Metro from the city with about 2-3 changeovers. Overall the cleanliness of the park is surprisingly high despite the crowds. The toilets are extremely clean, and so are the rides. Facilities in the park include, wheelchairs, strollers, toilets and food outlets.I went in the summer with temperatures ranging from 38 - 40 Degrees Celsius. It is extremely hot and tires you out just about immediately. A tip here would be to carry enough sun protection, hats , umbrellas  and lots of water.In my opinion, don't bother until later. The park opened on the 16th of June (2016). It is still fairly new and the hype of a new Disney park is still on. Else, book the VIP pass {at a great price) and have a magical day...."

1355,4.0,Jul 2016,"Vantaa, Finland ",Nice park but need a plan,"We visited in early July 2016 and enjoyed it. Some tips/experiences to share:1) Plan ahead if you wish to get most out. Many people only manage 4 or 5 rides for one day trip. Tickets can be purchased online beforehand. 2) Download ""Shanghai Disney Resort"" app for information of event schedules, maps and waiting time3) The park lets guest in bit earlier than official opening hour e.g. 8:30am (Mon-Thu 9:00-21:00, Fri-Sun 8:00-22:00). Opening time is subjected to change for different seasons4) Early birds run for for a FP (fast pass)5) Run to ""Tron Lightcycle Power Run"" once light show is finished around 20:50 (starts at 20:30), you will catch the last few rides with 5mins of queuing time. Ride at night is cooler than day time. Looking for the correct locker is like amazing race.6) Water protector may be needed for your gears (mobile, camera) when going for “Roaring Rapids”. It closes for queuing at 17:00.7) Light show is fantastic!8) Bear in mind its China, things must have Chinese flavor :-) In fact, Walt Disney only hold 43% of share of Shanghai Disney resort.9) Get used to lots of trash on the ground while queuing10) Staff is great!Enjoy your day in Shanghai Disney resort!"
1356,2.0,Jul 2016,N/A,Not such fairytale anymore,"I love Disney land, but not so much with the local behavior. Keep your eyes alert if not they will jumping your line, they even dare using their kids , talking in loud voice, taking picture before, during and after the show, smoking in forbidden area,  and many more. Our visit was in summer, high temperature drive them even crazier. An old women let their toddler urinated inside the restaurant, under the table, Luckily the employees stopping her. Umbrella and camera self picture stick everywhere blocking the show. Chinese people ready need to up grade there behavior, they ruined my mood, no more fairytale atmosphere.We were sitting in front the castle waiting fireworks show for 1.5hour, then suddenly 2 Chinese local girls came 30minutes before the show beginning and sitting in front of us asking me to give them spot. When I'm not agree but they still slowly remove their butt closer to my spot. It even worse when the show begin they try to records the whole show with their mobile phone and blocking my sight. Oh, and almost all the show and attractions were in Chinese, so not recommended if you not understand Chinese language. "
1357,5.0,Jul 2016,"Dallas, TX ",Raising the bar,"This is a phenomenal park. The attention to detail rivals the best Disney parks--including Disney Sea. The staff deserve the highest praise: every time we crossed a threshold they greeted us with hellos, genuine smiles, and waves. This is the Disney signature but it is also one of those touches unfortunately missing from some other parks (**cough, France...***). Go in with a plan: fast passes go quickly and have long lines. Be prepared for crowds and some frustration from other patrons (on par with other Disney parks. The added frustration as an English-speaking foreign traveler is that few of us can communicate effectively. This is the problem of the traveler, not the park). A few specifics:Rides: The must-see marquee events for us were tron and pirates. Tron is like a mix of rockin roller coaster and space mountain with top-notch theming and design work. Pirates is mind-blowing: the familiar features of the old ride with well-executed effects, big screen immersion, and fantastic theming (you are under water with the Pirates until you come above for an epic battle). Soaring was spectacular of course but is now the same as California adventure's soaring (save the Shanghai finale). To be honest, we waited 15 minutes to get the soaring fast pass, and another 25-30 in the fast pass line. So overall it was a 45 minute wait at least and used up one of our two valuable fast passes (I say two because everything's gone by the afternoon)... Which for a ride available in the US should maybe not be such a high priority for US visitors.Ride plan: Our first plan was to get soaring fast passes and then ride the Rapids. Unfortunately, this seemed to be everyone else's plan too so we changed course. The Rapids line was wrapped around the fast pass area by 8:45. We got our soaring fast pass ASAP: rope drop was around 8:35 for a 9am opening, we had the fast-pass in-hand after waiting in line by about 8:50, with a 12:00 return to ride time. We skipped Rapids and instead hit fantasy land, which was great because we walked on or had 5 minute waits on four rides: Winnie the Pooh, Peter Pan, 7 dwarves mine train, pirates of the Caribbean. With the exception of the incredible pirates, those other 3 rides were solidly entertaining but nothing special if you've been to other parks (7d mine train in particular: shocking as later in the day it had 2 hour waits!!). But it's a great plan if you're going with small kids and want to avoid long lines for these rides later in the day. Just before getting our next fast pass we rode buzz lightyear (different design and theme from Astro blasters, but same game). When we got off that we were eligible to get fast passes again, so we got one for tron, encountering another long (20 minute) line just to get a fast pass (picked up around 11, 2:30 ride time). We loved the ride and so rode it again on standby in the evening (90 minute listed wait time, about 65 minutes of actual waiting). We rode soaring (fast pass) and pirates (standby for a second time, about 30 min wait) in the afternoon. We felt we got to every ride that was most important and even got to re-ride those we liked the best.Shows: based on recommendations we went to the jack sparrow stunt show and Tarzan. First, the good: Tarzan was INCREDIBLE. It's like a gymnastics ballet, nearly wordless, with Chinese covers of the Phil Collins songs. Very, very accessible for non-Mandarin speakers. Each number was high-energy, beautifully executed, and jam-packed with talent and action. Ropes and springs fill in for Tarzan's vines to spectacular ends. Imagine all of the grand stunts of a cirque du soleil show packed into 30 minutes of non-stop beauty. The show was so good we saw it twice. The amphitheater is huge and well laid-out. We arrived 5-15 minutes before showtime on both occasions and got in. All seats are great. By contrast, the jack sparrow show was a huge disappointment. You wait 15 minutes into the show for jack sparrow to show up, and even then there are really only two stunts (one, mediocre, the other quite good but not really worth the wait). The rest of the time you are sitting through a slapstick pantomime with other, very broad, characters. This is one where not knowing mandarin will leave you in the dark most of the time. But even then the show did not seem to get many laughs from the crowd, and visually it was never very interesting or amusing. Worse still, after waiting in a line outside, they usher you into a pre-show room where they ""warm up"" the crowd for 10 minutes (10 of the total 30 runtime) and you have to stand the whole time. Then they let you into the theater, which is poorly laid out: everyone from a huge room funnels through two main rows. Lots of discomfort and shoving while walking down stairs... So, skip jack sparrow and just see Tarzan (many times!) if you're looking to beat the heat.Food: we opted to keep our options open and snack throughout the day and the offerings did not disappoint. First we got some delicious snacks from the snackin' kraken near pirates: it tasted like a mix between fried calamari and French fries, with light drizzles of bbq sauce and mayo: yum! Later we got some Mickey-shaped pizza from the Pinocchio village kitchen: it was delicious! Various flavors including unique spins on mozerella/margarita, bbq, and duck. We also shared a chocolate drenched Donald Duck waffle located in the shops between the entry and Disney town (walking toward tron). My husband also had three (THREE!) lattes: two mochas and one caramel. He kept going back for more because they were so good. One disappointment was the churro: they didn't seem very popular so when I bought one in the evening it was pretty dried out. But, overall, we were constantly delighted by the good food offerings. And while 10 rmb for water may be a notable markup from Chinese prices outside Disney, it was very affordable for a theme park (about $1.50), which was well worth it for something cold to keep us hydrated throughout the day. Also nice: most patrons seemed to bring in their own food, so there were never huge lines to buy snacks and meals, which was great. The downside to this is that they seem to close a lot of the smaller snack shops sometime between 5 and 6, so make sure to get in on those early.Misc: toilets are clean and plentiful, shopping options are varied with good selection. Well-staffed shops make it easy to check out. There were a lot of stroller park/rest areas.Room for improvement: others have touched on this so I'll try to keep it brief. This is a new park in a huge country where there is a ton of excitement about it's opening. This means crowds. Very eager crowds. Many people come in huge groups which creates problems for lines: waiting for security a fight almost broke out because a guy without a bag not only tried to circumvent the line of eager people (all there well before opening) but insist that his whole family (who all had bags) should also get to cut the line. At tron, a few family members got ahead of their group, and they tried to insist that the TEN TO TWENTY people also ""with"" them should get to jump ahead in line, after everyone else had already waited 10 minutes. After refusing, some of the kids shoved past us, and then tried to use that as justification for letting other family members cut. So waiting in line, at times, feels like a battle. The Pirates line was by far the least well-managed. We tried to do single rider but apparently people just thought it was a shorter line, so people were jumping back and forth and made the single rider line indiscernible from the regular line, defeating its purpose. Single rider lines on the whole, which are usually lifesavers on busy days, did not really function at all while we were there. They shut down single rider on Tron for long periods throughout the day (presumably for a reason similar to what was happening on pirates). Luckily we caught some lucky breaks throughout the day and did not need single rider to get on the best attractions, but its absence noticeably slowed down the wait times. Soaring didn't have single rider, but every single row had at least one empty seat (in fact, an entire third of the ride was empty--that's three full rows. Presumably there was a mechanical issue, but it sure is noteworthy to be poorly loading a ride with a constant 3-hour wait). The staff does absolutely everything in their power to make things better: carefully guarding entry points, loading carefully when possible, warning misbehaving guests, etc. but they can't see and control everything. Signs even warn about cutting, leaving the line, families entering together, but it doesn't get the job done. There definitely need to be staff members located throughout the queues. People should probably be kicked out of line for cutting. The single rider lines could be more carefully guarded. Fast passes also could be sorted out: waiting 15-20 minutes for a fast pass, and then another 30 minutes in line (as with soaring) almost defeats the purpose.Minor quibbles aside (which, again, exist at all parks, and should be expected at a brand new, state-of-the-art facility), this is a brilliant park. It feels fully-formed (unlike Hong Kong which, even after expansions feels ""small."") It has tons of intricate charm, fabulous staff, and ground-breaking attractions. I only wish it was easier to get to from the US! As a staff member said to my husband when he complimented his delicious iced coffees by calling them ""awesome"": ""no, they're magical."" Shanghai Disney lives up to, and presses the boundaries of, the magical world of Disney."

We were 5 people with two young kids in July which is supposedly the hottest time of the year in Shanghai and 2016 has been worse. But excellent amenities and good design of the park helped us to stay from 9am in the morning to 9 in the night.Its quiet obvious when you are in China or in India any place like this would have throng if people everywhere but I believe that is the beauty of being in populated nations- 'you are never alone'. Heat made people sit and relax at what ever place they found convenient. That's obvious and Disney can not help it.The park is well designed to maneuver the crowds getting in, its important that you start early. Buy tickets online which saves you one line and do carry a lot of water bottles as it a lot of hard work while you are entertained. For sure one day is not enough for this park so make your choices, whether its the rides or the shows or the shopping places which exclusively cell Disney stuff. We are pure vegetarians so we carried some of our food and were not enquired after bag checks at the entrance. Do not forget to carry passports for all foreigners to get your passes.After entering inside the first view is appalling, a beautiful castle in front, uncle scrooz bank on the left and rattatue bakery on the right. The fin starts here. The buildings are very well thought our with Disney characters around the corner either performing or posing to for a snap with lot of children who love there characters. I even had one with my childhood favorite Mickey and Goofy.The shows are all in Chinese language but the technology used and effects created on stage are jaw-dropping. Best ride for my visit was the pirates of Caribbean. Note that I could not cover the Tron ride, which is rated the best on internet. Reason- There is always a waiting line for every ride, Tron was more than an hour and a half while all other were 20 to 40 min. The show at the castle was excellent which my little daughter, crazy for Elsa, went nuts after seeing her perform. Here the songs, atleast were in English.Talking about amenities, there are lot of eating joints with excellent AC to chill off and recharge your body. The Ambience is excellent with beautiful paintings and creative interiors. The Pirates town is exceptionally done. Most of the staff can speak, basic English but there are others who are very good. So no problem with communication.Do not leave without the laser and fire show at 8:30 pm, for which you need to take your place in front of the castle to get the best view.An Excellent experience overall! Thanks Disney"
1359,3.0,Jul 2016,"Lincoln, UK ",Teething Troubles but Potential,"I was lucky to be in China, just a few weeks after the official opening of Shanghai's Disneyland, so a visit was a must. Having experienced the European and US (Florida) Disneyland's my expectations were high.I wasn't disappointed as I walked towards the massive park (17 years to build), the attention to detail is fantastic and as you would expect, everything crisp new and clean, with immaculate garden settings.The usual Disney experience of parades and shows is comparable and high tech rides and shows a must.. However, my day was slightly dampened by more than a few (hopefully), teething problems.1.) Fast Pass ride ticket stations difficult to find (and run out by 11.30am..)2.) Very crowded and up to 3hr 20 mins queue time for main rides.3.) Locals blatantly queue jumping, with staff just accepting it.4.) Single rider queues not being utilised, even though lots of ride carriages had the odd empty place here and there.5.) Although the park is open to 10pm, by 4pm a lot of the food outlets were closing (sold out ?).6.) Congestion and pushing at times was quite scary, good job I'm not claustrophobic.It has great potential but really needs to limit visitor numbers and/or quickly get building more attractions else people (after the initial excitement) are not going to return, already know of a couple of locals who will not be wasting 3 hrs queuing for one ride again.Staff need to be better organised and ensure waiting in line is just that and the scrummage for shows seats was worse than mob rule.Unfortunately the staff did not add to the experience at all, at every other Disneyland, cast members are happy smiling multi cultural people, not just surly looking, harassed tired, (mainly locals).As I say great potential, and I'm sure I will return in the future but at the moment, only an average rating until some of these teething issues are resolved."
1360,5.0,Jun 2016,"Miami, FL ","After all the hype and hoopla, Shanghai Disney delivers a home run!!!","After months of planning and research, I felt like I had to manage my expectations towards how I would experience and ultimately judge the Grand Opening of Disney's newest and most scrutinized park in modern history. Early reports of the parks' status were less than flattering. Over-budgeted, behind schedule, and frightengly gross, the Park lead to overwhelming cynicism even within the most avid Disney fan. HOWEVER, my experience over a 3 day stretch at ShDLR contradicts every conventional wisdom I developed within this time. Not only did ShDLR extinguish any concerns over cleanliness, the cast members appeared to be genuinely interested in appeasing and satisfying our requests. "
1361,5.0,Jul 2016,"Helsinki, Finland ",Great show of fireworks,"I really loved the park. Not all the rides were that great but there have to be something for every taste. Peter Pan-ride, Buzz Lightyear-ride and Alice in wonderland were my favorites, but for the kids the Dumbo-ride was unforgettable as meeting the Goofy and Pluto. The food at the park was average, but priced ok and lot of variety. The park is huge, two days can be easily spent. The best part was still lightshow and fireworks in the dark evening, but my kids were too tired to watch it."
1362,4.0,Jul 2016,"Singapore, Singapore ",Very sad to leave - a pearl in the Disneyland experience worldwide!,"We'd read a lot of bad press about Shanghai Disneyland's grand opening period, so our expectations were set. However, the Park was an incredible experience of Disney in China, and much better than Hong Kong Disneyland! Using the Disney app to gauge queue times was helpful in planning out our 2-day adventure during the hottest temperatures of the year in Shanghai. The Park is well thought out with wide-avenues to handle the crowds, and the food options were also surprisingly plentiful (we'd read these were limited, but we completely disagree). All very civilized and enjoyable with many activities and attractions. We were very sad to leave and are already planning our return."
1363,2.0,Jul 2016,"Hacienda Heights, CA ",Not the Happiest Place on Earth - at least for now,"I been to all disneylands in the world, except one.  I know Disneyland quality and the Disney environment.  I love everything Disney.  I do not know about some of the positive reviews on here, but here is my honest experience.  Amazing infrastructure, beautiful park, Tron is new and different; love the A/C in restrooms and the Star Wars/Marvel/Mickey meet places have no wait and are very cool (China just not into some American icons yet).  The price is a bargain, but really too low only 500 yuan about $75 dollars.  This issues Disney can control - more signage, huge park easily get lost/confused; more staff in the field (numerous staff in the stores selling stuff, best to assist customers in the park).  Issues they can try to minimize; smoking (could not see the smoking areas signs, but seems like the whole park, many people smoking.  Black market on fast passes, massive rush of people to get fast past and sell them for 300 yuan at the local bathrooms. There is a whole network on non-traditional Disney customers in the park only for the purpose to make money.  Cutting in line, yes I know the culture differences, but it is so obvious and local Chinese Disney employees do not stop it or even mention it.  Most popular is coming in through emergency exit and my child/parent/cousin etc.. is in front of me and I just trying to find them.  Sleeping beauty castle, so beautiful outside - inside a mass of people squatting, sleeping eating non-Disney food (the image of train station comes to mind). Disney employee hide inside of fancy restaurants in the castle.  Solution - double the admission price (sorry), hire more staff for park, enforce no-smoking, line behavior and eliminate the obvious black market.  I left after four hours, the non-chinese disney staff asking the family in really good chinese to please not stand in the flower bed and have a seat in the bench in front of them - they refused and actually laughed.  He said xie xie and walked away. This place has potential, I hope the environment will change for the future."
1364,1.0,Jul 2016,N/A,This is not a Disneyland,"Over crowded, broken equipment, bad attitude staff. I used to love Disneyland and this is literally the worst Disneyland in the world. Will never visit again."
1365,5.0,Jul 2016,"Beijing, China ","Such a great summer holiday there, we were sad to leave!","I was mentally prepared that Shanghai Disneyland might not be as great as other Disneyland that I've been to (Paris & Hong Kong), but I was so wrong!We had so much fun!I am so glad that we plan our days activities as it was suggested by Shannon083 in the review below, because we got to to ride all the rides that we wanted to! We have a toddler under 106 cm, so, we had to filter those rides that we cannot go with him & stuck with our plan!Getting in the park: We went early, around 9AM, and there were SOOOOO many people! First stage is the bag inspection, some packaged food are allowed to be brought in, but not loose food or bags of fruit (I saw some people brought 2 bags of probably 2kg of grapes, they had to dump them!). Refrain from bringing glass bottles, they won't let you bring them in. You are allowed to bring plastic bottles, though, and inside the park, there are so many drinking water fountains that you can refill your bottles with! (It will save you lots of money, because, one bottle of water costs RMB10, other drinks RMB15).Second stage is ticket purchase, which we skipped because we bought our tickets online *thankfully!*Third stage is entrance. Be prepared for a slow queue, because each person has to be checked for identification before you get in. Do have an umbrella or hat if you come during hot days, because it may take a while.If you come early morning, once you get in, go straight for Fast Pass tickets! We got lucky both days! We got Soaring over the Horizon fast pass for both days and all the Fast Pass tickets for all the eligible rides in Fantasyland the second day. If you come with family/friends, you can ask just one person to go with all the tickets to go through the Fast Pass queue, while, maybe other shop or take photos or queue for non-FP rides.How we did it:Day 1: Adventure Isle, Garden of Imagination and Treasure Cove.Day 2: Fantasyland & Tomorrowland.This way, we covered everywhere we wanted to go, except for the actually Garden of Imagination, because the day was so hot!We also got to see as many as 12 characters, so do look around, they have permanent spots where the characters will be and as the Chinese are not so familiar with the Character meetings, the queue is bearably short!The cast members are great; friendly, try to communicate with me, even the ones with very little English! I do appreciate their effort! They seem to be proud to be working there, too, which give me a happy feeling! They greet us when we get in to the shops or at the ride entrance. They are also quite strict, if they see anyone trying to jump the queue order (e.g., during a character meeting). They do try to impose order and minimise chaos as much as possible, but be prepare for line-cutting people, because we encountered many of them in the parks. Do stand your ground, I had to keep saying 'hey!' and stopping them from jumping the line.Toilets are exceptionally clean (and is a great place to stay cool, when it's too hot outside!). Restaurants & cafes are clean too, the waiters & waitress are very fast to clear out the tables. The only downside is the outdoor eating areas, where people eat and did not clear out their tables when they finish. That's, of course, is not Disney's fault. I just wish those people are more mindful of others!Currently, the trees & plants in the park are young, so there isn't much shades available. For us, it was the heat that slowed us down. So hopefully, by next year, it is more comfortable to go during summer, when the trees have grown a bit more.P.s. don't miss the Mickey's storybook Parade - we watched at the border of Tomorrowland & Fantasyland (twice a day at noon and 3pm), the princess show at the castle - they have the show several times during the day and Ignite the night firework at 8.30 pm.Definitely go on Soaring over the Horizon AND the Pirates of Caribbean rides! They are amazing! One that I'd love to go is Tron, too bad my son is not tall enough to ride, so I had to give it a miss."
1366,4.0,Jun 2016,"Bangkok, Thailand ",Better than I expected.,"Heard so much about the rumours on tge chinese crowd at Disneyland Shanghai. But it was actually better than I expected ( of course there are people sitting on the floor inside walkway by the fairy castle and all those stuff, but as of their culture, it was okay for me). We got a few kids tried to skipped the queue in front of us, but we managed not to let them. The rides were great! Especially Tron! There are lockers before you entering the ride so you can store your big pieces of belongings there. But also the individual bike itself has a small storage with a cover, enough room to store your phone and a cap. I didn't take my phone inside and it was ashamed because I could not take pictures of the cool interior!!! So i recommended you bring yours. Average waiting time was for each ride was around 15-60 mins. Fast pass was not needed for me. Enjoy! "
1367,5.0,Jul 2016,N/A,Its Disney Land,"Its Disney Land !!!!U still want a review?????Opened in June'16.....The only best place at Shanghai.....the only place in Shanghai where you find smiling, co-operative, English speaking and understanding Chinese people....and its only because as I feel  Disney is not form China !!!Its always a great experience to be at Disney land.......get into your childhood and enjoy spectacular shows and rides.....But at the same time be prepared for extreme walking....So so so crowded with least waiting time of 30-45 minutes everywhere....If you are not 30 minutes before the show/ride time u are not gonna get it....Everything is so very perfect.....just one problem that if u do not know Chinese it gets too difficult some time but that's everywhere in ChinaAnd yes dont miss the Tron ride at Lightening speed at Tommorrow Land, it will really bring your heart out in hands    !!!!!!!Do take out a day or two from your Shanghai visit to experience the childhood yet again."
1368,5.0,Jul 2016,"Nadi, Fiji ",Plan your days Activities well and youll get to do and see ALOT!,"Being it Disneyland ALL and i mean ALL the workers speak English (Proficiency is real good), but all signs i saw had english translations as well, those who said otherwise lied, some instructions which are said only in chinese are aimed only to the locals. Stay away from the Soaring Over the Horizon in Adventure Isle the queu makes you feel like youre trapped in a Mine with no escape. Big advice get a fast Pass from guest service desk or enter the single lines except for theTRON Lightcycle and Battle for Sunken Treasure, the main queu is very fast even though they say the waiting time is 45minutes plus. Also wear canvas as a particular activty i couldnt do which was the Çhallenge Trails in Discovery Camp. The musicals are AMAZING! But rememeber they close entry 10minutes prior to the show starting so queue 20 minutes in advance. First show to see best is at the Enchanted Castle courtyard which is at 10am then head to see everything else plus dont miss the Fireworks Light show at 8.30pm its AMAZINGRides not to miss are the TRON Lightcycle (At night is better faster lines plus Lighting Effect, also easy to get fast pass at night) and Battle for the Sunken Treasure in Treasure Cove. Tarzan and Eye of the Storm shows should not be missed, all shows remember are in Mandarin.Food costs you around 80rmb but are tasty, and most food arnet chinese whoever said so lied. Buy your water before cos water costs above 10rmb inside. I only manage to do half of the things the whole day (so many things to do) and really cant wait to get back and finish. ENJOY!"
1369,5.0,Jul 2016,"Aberdeen, UK ",Great park,"Having been to all the other Disney Parks, this park had a lot to live up too.  I was dreading the queues, but this wasn't quite as bad as is expected.  We stayed at the Disneyland hotel so it was easy enough to get to the park.  Locals seem to have tickets on their phones, which must have problems as that seems to slow down entrance to the park.  We had tickets and had no such problems at the turnstiles. Layout is very good and the castle is spectacular.The new rides like Tron, Pirates all help to add something to this park and make it a must see for Disney fans like myself.  Many reviews have said that there is not much English in the park.  That is true, but then this park has been designed for the Chinese and that should be respected.The toilets were very clean and there were plenty of western cubicles.The only problem was the heat and humidity which made it a very tiring day.  Thank goodness we stayed at the Disney hotel as we were able to go back for a shower and rest during the day. Queues are long for a lot of the rides and due to the heat you may be out off joining them.  They could do with more shade from the sun between lands as there is a lot of walking to do.  We walked from shop to shop where possible to get a cool down.Tomorrowland looks so much more futuristic than the other parks and at night it is lit up fantastically.I'm sure the park will get quieter once the excitement of a new park has died down and when it is not school holidays.I think it would be far more pleasant to come in the spring or Autumn.We loved this park and look forward to seeing how it grows.Overall the crowds are not nearly as bad as Disneyland Tokyo!"
1370,1.0,Jul 2016,"Boulder, CO ",Go some where else,The geniuses at Disney managed to make entire lines of children cry with their lack of forward thinking. There are no cooling systems in any of the lines which many are over 2hrs long. For many of the lines kids where waiting in the sun. I saw three pass out waiting for the princess castle. I saw more then 32 kids crying to go home. We only started counting after we noticed the episodes repeating themselves. If you don't speak Chinese you will be in for a very frustrating experience. Staff is very poorly trained and offer no help unless specifically. I saw one staffer walk away from a foreign group asking where they could buy ice cream. Sa state of affairs for Disney. Place was unbelievable in it lack of simple misters and fans for the folks inline. Blew my mind how bad this Disney was.
1371,2.0,Jun 2016,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ","Great beautiful new park, only ruined by fellow guests (the locals)","We actually went on the official opening day of the park in June 2016. Needless to say, the crowd was insane. Took us one hour to get through the entrance where they take a picture of your face as they scan your ticket (which is mainly the reason for the hold up). Also a lot of the locals don't print out their tickets and thus have problems when scanning the code from their cellphones which further causes more congestion.The park is huge and it means a lot a lot of walk to get from one area to the other. And in the summer heat, it can be terribly exhausting; especially with the kind of queues they have.On the first day, all and I mean ALL, fast passes were gone by 1PM. Take note that unlike all the other Disney Parks, the fast passes are not by each ride but all rides within an area are under one Fast Pass counter in that area. So that day, to get a Fast Pass, we were required to queue for an hour as well. This is unheard of in any other Disney park.And if you choose to go on the standby queue, be prepared for 130-150 minute waits by noon for most of the popular rides. We couldn't get on Tron that day because it broke down.Pirates of the Caribbean is highly recommended; done on a much larger scale with state of the art technology. However you do feel like that classic feeling is missing compared to the old ride. It's just not the same with the lack of ""Yo-ho, yo-ho~ A pirate's life for me~"".We queued 2 and a half hours for Soaring. It was long and the heat made it all the more excruciating. But nothing beats the behaviour of the local guests in the long queues. Many of them refuse to take their children out of the queue to the nearest toilet, which is why you can find plenty of corners with wet floors in the queues... They also tend to litter everywhere despite there being dustbins in the queue. It was a bit of a shock to us to find a whole pile of trash placed in the walls during the wait. People also tend to push and cut queues. The woman behind me stood so close that her breast were pressed up against my back. Right after that, her restless child kicked me the shin.We had a meal prior to leaving. Mostly everything is Asian cuisine and the food is actually quite acceptable. Be prepared to repeat yourself in English a lot. Most of the crew members don't speak English.By 4PM, we were too exhausted to want to stay any longer. If you're planning to make a trip there, I suggest you plan ahead and it will be difficult to get on many rides."
1372,5.0,Jul 2016,"Myllykangas, Finland ",Clean toilets!,"Oh, i love it! Everything possible to see, one day is too short time to see and to do all the things! Big thanks to the cleaners, toilets are clean!"
1373,5.0,Jun 2016,Beijing ,Disney Magic with Chinese Flavor,"I'm a native of southern California and work in China, so I was excited to be a part of opening weekend! I was mentally prepared for crowds, pushing, spitting, and other general bad habits commonly seen in China, but I was surprised to be wrong! The park is spectacular, clean, and designed to accommodate the masses. Nevertheless, here are some suggestions:Before you go:- Download the App. It has wait times (I found them to be accurate), stores park tickets, and has an easy to read map. -Buy tickets before you go.Food:- Food in the park is primarily Chinese, though foods that most people would like (Teriyaki Chicken, Chicken with vegetables, Lamb, etc.). There are some western options near Tron. If you NEED western food, just jump out to Disney Town toward Blue Frog, Element Fresh, Cheesecake Factory, or Wolfgang Puck. Every quick service restaurant had the same prices with meals at 75 RMB for entrée and drink.-If you need breakfast before the park, there's a large Starbucks near the entrance which was well stocked and a fast line.You can take food into the park Shows:- Even if you don't speak a lick of Chinese, GO SEE THE SHOWS. There is Captain Jack Sparrow's Stunt Spectacular which begins in the lobby with a vaudeville-esque show before moving into the auditorium. It was a spectacular show unlike any other I've seen. I also recommend the Tarzan show- an acrobatic retelling of the story. -The Frozen Sing-Along is in Chinese and a bit cheezy. Good for Chinese kids, otherwise, skip.Rides:-Fast passes are distributed at designated locations, not at the ride itself. Each ""land"" has a guest services area where the passes are distributed for all rides in that land. - The longest waits were for Soarin' over the Horizon (identical to the new show at California Adventure) and Roarin' Rapids. The line for Soarin' is indoors and air-conditioned. -Pirates of the Carribean is fantastic and lines were shorter than 15 minutes all day.-Tron seemed to move faster than other lines. I was in the park for 2 days, as it was the purpose of my trip, but you could do the park in one full day. 2 days was nice because it gave me some flexibility, especially with unpredictable summer weather. When it rained, ponchos were cheap and easy to find.Take time to appreciate the Chinese influences- the Zodiac told through Disney characters, architectural elements, etc. for example."
1374,5.0,Jul 2016,UK ,Great fun,"Went here with 2 daughters ( 18 +21). Firstly took taki from bund ( 101rbm going, 140 back- you are travelling against traffic) was going to take metro but taxi relatively cheap and only about 30 mins. Bit of walk to ticket, just showed print out of ticket confirmation at turnstile and got tickets. Took passport but nobody asked to see it. Typical Disney structures inside but not as big as California. Staff lovely and had learnt enough English to deal with the questions they expect. Went to Tron first and rode twice in half an hour, but after that typical Disney waiting times. Fewer rides but technology several steps higher. Peterman new begining, Pirates of Caribbean incredible, 7 dwarves fun, toy story a bit tame. Soarin fantastic BUT get fast pass- 2 hr wait. Fast pass only available in section where ride is. We made mistake on this and didn't realise. A lot of fast pass for rides have run out by 12 so get your soarin one as soon as you enter. Bathrooms all very clean and nice ( find western cubicles ). Food easy to order, busy but not packed ( weather was very wet at times. We left about 6 pm and had no trouble getting taxi from rank.We enjoyed it a lot and worth going to , however we have spent the rest of our time in China doing cultural things!"
1375,1.0,Jul 2016,N/A,Where's the Disney magic?,"Ok first of all, majority if not all the rides were in Chinese. Probably that's their target market, ie. the locals. Overall experience is ... ""Not my cuppa tea"" Extremely overcrowded with overzealous locals who want a taste of the American / International goliath brand that is Disneyland. They got all the funds to finance the biggest... the latest features that cutting edge technology can buy. But when you're lining up with the locals who have no sense of courtesy or personal space... It turns sour pretty quickly as they queue in vertical lines as a group instead of our standard ""queue per family unit"" . After 4 hours of struggling to get onto any rides and arguing with the ever impatient locals that they were in fact not in front of 20 other ppl... A bus load of us decided to leave. That's over 50 ppl leaving because we couldn't stand being pushed around constantly. At least in Japan, it is unintentional and they say ""Gomenasai.. Or sumimasen"" ( which is literally 'excuse me'). It was not the park experience... But the culture of the Chinese ppl that gave me and my American friends a horrible experience.On the plus side, the food was Ok... Unless you hate Chinese food. The only western food you might get is good Ol' ice cream from Donald's parlor. Again I'd like to ask, "" Where's The Magic?"""
1376,5.0,Jun 2016,"Frisco, TX ",June 2016 Family Trip to Shanghai Disneyland,"This past June our family spent three days visiting Shanghai Disneyland with two nights at the Disneyland Hotel and two days in the park.  Here are some thoughts / tips to make your experience as enjoyable as possible:1. The park gates open before the stated opening time.  You can get through security and have your ticket scanned and enter the park before the stated opening times.   Rides don't open until the opening time.2. Wait times posted for rides are not accurate; in fact they can be ridiculously inaccurate.3. The crowds can be enormous (just like the size of the park).  You MUST have a plan.  4. Our family thought that Tron was the best ride.  We headed straight for this ride and either rode it or got a fast pass.  Do not standby for this ride as the wait can be much, much longer than stated.5. Be prepared to watch the 'locals' frequently cut in line....  6. Food choices in the part are very Chinese with very limited 'Western' types of food.  Disneytown is located adjacent to the park and has several good choices (the burger at Wolfgang Puck's was amazing!!!)7.  Its hard to find water for sale until about 11 am as many of the kiosks are closed.  Given the heat, know where to find cold water is critical!8. Roaring Rapids fast passes where the first to 'sell-out' each day.9.  The distances between 'lands' and rides is big... 10. Very, very little English is spoken in the park, hotel or restaurants11. Everyone is still learning their jobs... it took our boat captain (Hotel to Park water taxi) several attempts to dock the boat.12. The fireworks show was amazing.  See it from inside the park and not from the hotel.I hope you have a great visit to this wonderful park!"
1377,4.0,Jul 2016,Alabama ,Decent,"Good park, facilities are nice and most of the staff was great. If you have young blonde children then be warned that you will be approached a ridiculous amount of times by locals and be asked to take pictures with them (got old really quick). I live in Asia and I'm used to it but for some reason is was alot more aggressive here. A few times the staff (cast members) did as well which came off somewhat unprofessional. Overall a decent experience."
1378,3.0,Jul 2016,"Tewkesbury, UK ",Not enough thrill rides ,"I had a very enjoyable day at Disney Shanghai. After debating if it was going to be too hot for a day walking round a theme park we decided to buy our tickets online the day before.. However the website was not taking international cards so we had to get a friend in China to buy the tickets for us.. Would have been annoying if we didn't know someone who could get us the tickets. We got the subway from the bund area to the Disney resort, only cost us £1.50 for 2 people- this was a great start to the day. We arrived at 9am and it took us until 9:15 to get through the security line and ticket check. The day had already started to heat up so we headed straight for tron. Luckily the queue was inside and air-conditioned. Really great ride with a seating concept I hadn't seen anywhere else. I won't list all the other rides but the queues were around the 40 minute mark until lunchtime when you were looking at 90-120 minutes. The park didn't actually seem that busy so I can only think that there are not enough big rides to cope with the number of people which is causing long queues. In the heat the queueing was the best bit because the majority of rides we went on had indoor queues!All the staff were very friendly and helpful and it was easy to find someone who spoke English. The facilities were very good which is expected considering how new the park is. I have only been to Disneyland Paris so don't have much of a comparison but Paris has more thrill rides which is why I was slightly disappointed. All in all a good day out, probably much better for children. "
1379,4.0,Jul 2016,"Bowling Green, OH ",A good start--more to come,"I've read that this is the largest Disney park anywhere, and I believe it.  That doesn't mean that it has the most rides and activities.  It means that there is a LOT of walking.  Not a bad thing, but in that heat it can be a challenge.We arrived at park opening (actually, they opened the park a little before the announced time) and stayed only until about 8:30 pm.  The heat just became a little overwhelming by then, even though it had cooled down some.I am a major Disney fan and usually visit Disney World in Orlando every year or two.  I have also visited Disneyland in Anaheim a number of times.  So, that's what I'm comparing the new park to.The rides in the new park appear to be a technology upgrade from the rides elsewhere.  That's especially true for Pirates of the Caribbean--by far my favorite ride of the ones I experienced.  There is no comparison between this ride and the Pirates rides you find at other parks.  Check out the videos on YouTube to see what I mean.  I was literally blown away by this ride, and went back in the evening to ride it one additional time before leaving the park.The Soaring attraction isn't California, but major sites from around the world.  I had some trouble identifying all the included sites but, upon leaving the attraction, there are posters identifying each site included in the ride.Some rides, such as Peter Pan, appear to be only a modest improvement over the equivalent ride elsewhere, but still enjoyable.  There is a new ride called the Voyage to the Crystal Grotto.  This low-key boat ride sails past exhibits of various Disney films to end up in a grotto beneath the castle.  Very relaxing.The FastPass system works reasonably well, but the kiosks only issue FastPass tickets for rides in a single park area.  The areas in the park are Tomorrowland, Gardens of Imagination, Mickey Avenue, Fantasyland, Treasure Cove, and Adventure Isle.We didn't get to experience all the rides, not even half of them, because of lines and the amount of time it takes to walk from one area of the park to another.  However, we had a wonderful time at Shanghai Disneyland.I found the food in the park to be quite good and reasonably priced.  I've read reviews that disagree with this, but that's how I see it.  There is a restaurant pretty close to Pirates that has the best pork ribs I've had in quite a while--the ample meat literally falls off the bone and is moist and deliciously seasoned.  It comes with rice, corn on the cob, and maybe something else I can't remember.  The price was about US $15 which I consider to be a bargain.  In another restaurant I had fried chicken that was quite good and also about $15 for the meal.  No complaints from me about the food.Many of the cast members speak no English.  That was no special problem for me since my wife is Chinese and can communicate for me.  When I was on my own, though, it was a little more challenging.  However, whenever I spoke to someone who couldn't speak English, they directed me to another nearby cast member who could converse with me easily.  It seems that at least one member in every group of cast members can speak English.  (I also met a cast member from Orlando who was especially helpful to me!)I look forward to returning to the park in a few years to see how things have developed."
1380,5.0,Jul 2016,N/A,"Great park, but be prepared and have a plan","We just finished a 4-day visit to the resort, spent 2 full days and 1 half day inside the park, and have absolutely zero regrets.  The park is amazing, but you must be prepared.  I saw so many people aimlessly wondering around the park, and later complaining that they were not able to ride any rides.  Each day I was there, I was able to ride the following rides several key rides before 1:00 with a smart usage of fast passes, standby lines, and running.  My suggestion, based on my trip is:Yes, it is early and they are going through growing pains- a few of the rides were temporarily closed and they aren't offering fast passes yet for roaring rapids, but that is the price you pay to be ""one of the first (thousand) to visit the park"".Here is my suggestion for your first day at the park:-arrive at least 1 hour before the park opens-get through security, and line up at the rope one the right side.  Choose someone to be your fast pass runner and give them all of your tickets- at rope drop, that one person runs (and I mean runs) to the fast pass booth for soaring over the horizons.  Each day I was able to get the first fast pass window (9:40-10:40).  Note that rope drop occurs 15-30 minutes before the park officially opens.- after getting your fast pass, go and ride dumbo or jet packs- immediately head to Tron and ride it standby.  Both days we got there before 9 (when the rides starts) or shortly after and had no wait- After Tron, do Buzz Planet rescue- if still before 9:40 (your fast pass window) knock out star wars and marvel to get easy pics with the characters- Go to Fast Pass booth closest to tomorrowland (the other one was always twice as crowded) and get a fast pass for 7D once your window opens- Head to Soaring.  Even with the fast pass, you will wait ~20 minutes.-After soaring, go and do Pirates unless the wait is >30 minutes- After pirates, your fast pass for 7D should be ready so go get a fast pass for Peter Pan- Ride 7D- Do the Alice Maze- Get your fast pass for Winnie the Poo once it opens (it will probably be for after 12:00)- RIde Peter pan- Eat lunch (I recommend the Cheesecake factory over the in-park food)- Ride PooI was able to do all of this before 2:00 on each day I was there (Saturday, Monday and Tuesday).  However, I was prepared, I ran to get my fast passes, and I didn't waste time when my windows opened.  Also, choose one night to see the fireworks in the park and get a good spot.  We arrived 1 hour early and we did not regret it."
1381,5.0,Jul 2016,"Tyler, TX ","Very Disney,  Very Chinese","All Disney rides and technology, but everything is only in Mandarin Chinese.  The Chinese have managed to screw up the Disney operation style too. However,  the park is laid out in the same manner as other Disney parks,  though the ""lands"" are different from other parks except for the fact that there is a Fantasyland and a Tomorrowland. It's overall a good experience,  as long as you understand Chinese"
1382,2.0,Jul 2016,N/A,Waste of time and money (at least on a summer weekend),"I gave myself two days to properly digest the Disney Experience. I am a huge fan of Disney, adventure, rides, thrill, etc.We went there July, 9th, a Saturday and as expected, many people were also there. For non-kids, the 4 major attractions are Tron, Pirates of Caribbean, 7 Dwarves and the Rapids.We arrived around 8am and went immediately to the Roaring Rapids but it was temporarily closed and no prediction for opening time. We went then to the Pirates and it was definitely funny. The 7 dwarves was our next target but, also temporarily closed. The lines for Tron were already around 2h so we tried other smaller rides giving time for the big 2 to finally open so we could go there and later in the day we could try Tron.By the time the Rapids opened, the waiting time was already 2h. We decided to go anyway. While waiting, 7 dwarves were still closed and Pirates was also temporarily closed (it seemed we were lucky to ride it before the issues happened).After a long wait we finally rode the Rapids (2-3 min).After that, with the Dwarves finally opened we went there. Another 2h of waiting for a less than 2 min ride.Tron was the same. 2h waiting for a 1 min ride.There are too few major rides (4) for too many people. When we arrived, 2 were closed so the crowds moved to the open ones. When the other 2 finally open, the crowds moved again. I'm afraid I can't recommend people to go there, at least on a weekend.To summarize the experience:We spent 499 RMB each, spent 14h inside the park and this time was distributed as follows: - 12h standing/waiting; - 1h walking around; - 20 min watching the parade; - 20 min eating; - 20 min riding.I feel I just wasted money and time."
1383,5.0,Jul 2016,"Cambridge, Canada ",Disney fans will not be disappointed!,"We spent an excellent day here on the fourth of July!Concerned that the lines would be huge, we took a cab from the Bund area at 6:45 in the morning to beat the crowds.  We had expected an hour drive and a 200 Renminbi (RMB) cab ride and were pleasantly surprised to arrive in 30 minutes at a cost of 130 RMB.We headed straight to the security line, which was scheduled to open at 8am and already had about 200 people in line and was filling up fast.  By 8am, there were at least 2000 people in line.The security line opened right on time at 8am and was very well organized.  We experienced minimal pushing from the crowds behind us, but the guards kept everyone under control.  Two members from our group had no bags and headed straight for the ticket counter.We had purchased our tickets online about two days before.  The Disney website was a bit shaky during the ordering process, but otherwise very straightforward.  You need to bring your confirmation number and passport with you to the park and the tickets are issued to you right at the turnstile.  All members of your group need to be at the turnstile to get the tickets, but only the purchaser needs to show a passport.  Each guest will also be photographed as the ticket is issued.Once we all had our tickets we were allowed into the park and we walked up Mickey Avenue.  The park was not scheduled to open until 9am and it was roped off to either side of Storytellers Statue.  At this point it was about 8:15am and we waited. We had secured a spot right in front of the ropes and managed to retain it until the ropes dropped at 8:45, 15 minutes earlier than expected.  Many people started running but the staff put a stop to it right away.We headed straight for Tron.  One member of our party went to collect the Fastpasses (FP) for the ride, but really, there was no need.  He waited in line for about 10 minutes and secured a 9:45am Fastpass.  Fastpasses are issued the old way, where you need to insert your park ticket and receive a paper Fastpass that you present at the ride during the appointed time for one ride at a time.  While he was in line, the rest of the party went on Buzz Lightyear Planet Rescue, which is right next to TRON and had NO line.  The ride is similar to the one at Walt Disney World, with improved laser guns.  The lasers can be lifted out of the holsters, are green or red depending on where you are sitting in the car and the gun vibrates and lights up when a target is hit.  Two members in our group were able to score over 700,000 points.It was now about 9:15 and we went into the standby entrance for TRON. There was a minimal line and we basically just walked right on.  This ride is very cool - it is similar to Test Track at WDW, but you are on a motorcycle.  It's an amazing experience and one not to be missed.The lines were so short that we squeezed in another ride on Buzz Lightyear before our Tron FP was active.Next stop Pirates of the Caribbean.  FPs are not available for this ride.  The wait time posted was 45 minutes, but it took us less than 20 to get to the ride.  All I am going to say is that it is spectacular!! The graphics are amazing and I do not want to spoil it for anyone who is going.  We went on it twice in a row.  Get a seat up front to experience it to the max.Seven Dwarfs Mine Train is the same as WDW.  If you are short on time, skip it.Soaring Over the Horizon is now available at WDW.  FPs for this ride were gone by 10am and the line was posted as 120 minutes for the remainder of the day, but the actual wait was closer to an hour.  People who suffer from claustrophobia will not like this line up as about a third of it is in a corridor about 5' wide with 10'  walls surrounding it and it's about 30' long until you snake around the corner and find yourself in another corridor.We skipped Roaring Rapids.  Wait times were posted as 120 minutes and people getting off the ride were soaked.Peter Pan is basically the same as WDW with a few improvements.  The cars now hold 6 people and the statues seem larger.We caught the parade twice.  The floats were colourful and interesting.  People weren't waiting for them to start hours ahead like at WDW, and we were able to secure good spots almost at the last minute both times. This parade is very tight, so once it starts, you cannot cross it until it is finished.We ate at the Tangled Tree Tavern.  We were very impressed with the food.  The Sichuan chicken was two full chicken breasts with fries and was mildly spicy.  The roasted chicken was juicy and a good size and came with mashed potatoes. The Mongolian beef was a mix of beef, noodles and vegetables and was also was very tasty.  We felt it was good value.The bathrooms are plentiful and clean with a good ratio of Western and Eastern toilets. We did not experience excessive line cutting or any other unusual behaviour that some other reviewers mentioned.  Most of the time we saw no evidence of crowds and walked on to many rides with minimal wait times.Many of the staff do not speak English, however, there did seem to be at least one person everywhere we went that could.  A special shout out to Flora, a supervisor in Guest Services, who was especially helpful!We had to leave the park around 4:30pm and opted to take the Metro home to avoid the traffic.  It was very easy and cost only 6 RMB per person.  The stop at Disneyland is the last one of Metro Line 11, so there were plenty of seats.  The stops on the maps and at the stations are all listed in English and Chinese and the transfers are easy.  The station maps make it obvious which direction the subway is headed. The subway was clean, not very crowded and the people riding it were all pleasant.Tips and Tricks:Buy your tickets early on-line.  Tickets were sold out for July 3 and 5th by July 1st. Don't forget to bring your passport!If Soaring is a priority get a Fastpass asap. TRON and Buzzlightyear had minimal lines in the morning. I recommend sending a scout to get Soaring FPs while the rest of the party heads to Tommorowland.Ask to sit in the front row for Pirates of the Caribbean to get the full effect of the experience.Many of the guests were unfamiliar with the Fastpass process and arrived too early. So if you see a large line at your appointed time, just move to the front and the attendants will let you in.Take the Metro.  It's cheap, clean, safe and an extra adventure for the kids! Buy your tickets on to the way to station.  It's only about a 5 minute walk from the park."
1384,5.0,Jun 2016,"Hong Kong, China ",Well done!,"Our family of 2 adults + 6 kids ages 0-12 (expats living here) had a chance to go about 2 weeks before the ""official"" opening in June, so not every ride was open, but here is what we did for our full-day adventure:-Tron (3 times)- very unique and fun, sit in the front! Feels a bit short-Buzz Lightyear (3 times)- very good, easy to shoot-Jet Packs- this one is popular, like Dumbo-Honeypots (the locals didn't really grasp the concept of spinning yourself)-7 Dwarves mine- nice effects, but so-so ride-Peter Pan- VERY nice special effects-Alice in Wonderland Maze- check out the hidden tricks and sound effects at the end of the maze.-PIRATES of the Caribbean- absolutely awesome effects!-Tarzan Show- don't miss this! super cool gymnastics-Carousel- very enjoyable-Parade- meh...-fireworks and light show at night- loved it, definitely worth stayingWe also walked around the castle, which is huge and has great mosaics. We also walked through the Garden of the 12 Friends, showing Disney characters representing Chinese zodiac, a neat local touch.Fastpasses go quickly (we managed to nab 2), line management is an issue, and the Chinese generally love Dumbo, Carousel, 7 Dwarves, Soarin' and Peter Pan. Talking to others, it seems line times vary but are really not that bad.We only tried the Tomorrowland restaurant, looked pretty good and not crowded. We tried a few food stalls, the popcorn and ice cream and pretzels were fine, the hot dogs were not good. The turkey legs looked great but were sold out. Disneytown outside the park for shopping has a Cheesecake Factory. Parking was fine, except that it is about a 10-15 minute walk from the Park entrance (tough at the end of a long day with little kids), but there is also a Disney metro stop. Also, the Park is pretty spread out so you will end up walking a lot between the different lands. Despite there being many smoking areas and plenty of toilets, this is still China, so expect to see some people ignoring them. The Park staff was helpful and all smiles, very good customer service."
1385,4.0,Jul 2016,"Torestorp, Sweden ",Great for the fans. Not many rides.,"Well done! Newly built disneyland Shanghai is handling the masses of people comming here wery well. Entrance was easy, you just need too book in advance and bring your passport (and booking number in case of). Taking photos with characters was quick. Get to the guest service in adventure land first to get a fastpass if you want to go on the rapids. Toilets were clean, air conditioned and many and you dont have to wait in a line for them. Dont go here just to go on rides though, there are much better theme parks for that."
1386,5.0,Jul 2016,"London, UK ","Big, friendly and clean","We stayed at the Toy Story hotel where we were about the only non Chinese guests. It is brand new and very clean, and the rooms are good. There are staff everywhere who are helpful and friendly and many speak some English. The park itself is excellent, of course you cannot top Florida but they have done an excellent job and it has the Disney feel. There is some new stuff with Marvel and Star Wars and despite reading about wait times our experience was he opposite and most things were very quick. Literally no-one in the queue to see Darth Vadar both days ! We also found between 17.30 and 21.00 (when the park closes) to be great times to hit the rides. If you expect Florida then you may be disappointed, but they have done really well and it is a great couple of days if you can avoid too much rain !"

Hint get your Disney passport upon entering from closest gift shop. Then when you go round you can get the passport stamped. Lines long 90 minutes for a 1 minute ride ...in future land.

1388,3.0,Jun 2016,"Singapore, Singapore ",Huge Disneyland,The place is just big. Went on a rainy day so it wasn't quite a good experience for me. There is a Disney Town outside of the park and it is built in the style of an outlet shopping village. The disney shop and Lego store are really the best for kids. Went on a weekday and the it isn't very crowded.
1389,5.0,Jul 2016,"Shanghai, China ",My expectations were exceeded!!,"Magical, fun, not so crowded as everyone told me, very well organized, in general worth the time and price... Tron is the best ride in the park and Pirates of the Caribbean was so much fun and impressive! We lined up for 30 and 20 min. respectively. Soaring over the Horizon is another must see but that was the longest line (about 1 hr.) Everything else is more childish yet very nice and enjoyable. Food is expensive but... they let you bring food in!!! Yes, we didn't believe it but we tried and it is true, mega applause to this park because that makes it even more affordable. If you are wondering how to get there, we took the subway line 11 the very end of the line (disney resort metro station) is your destination. A little bit confusing in the subway tho, keep an eye open in every station cuz we missed the one where you need to change trains and we lost a lot of time, anyway just follow the crowd. Only thing I didn't really enjoy was the disney parade because all the people gets really crazy and they don't let you take prime photos, if you like good photos you'll need to find a very cool spot where people won't push you, get right in front of your camera with their cellphone, or even hit you (one Chinese woman was furiously arguing with me because I didn't move out of the way enough for her to pass through) The staff was awesome and the toilets were so clean! A great great experience overall."
1390,4.0,Jun 2016,"Melbourne, Australia ",Surprisingly pleasant...not all that bad!,"We hit disneyland the week after it opened, and we braced ourselves for 3-5 hour queues. Surprisingly, it was generally pleasant - we had a few long waits (1-2 hours), but apart from that it was a great experience!You really need to get in early to get a fastpass, and unfortunately for us, the Tron ride was not opened the two days we were there. This was quite disappointing, and I do hate Disney for doing this. "
1391,5.0,Jun 2016,N/A,"Just Wow, well done Disney","2016 is the year I am going to every single Disney park, and no world tour would be complete without stopping by the new Shanghai Disneyland the week it opened!  My wife and I went on 20-Jue and all we could say was wow!  We expected huge lines, nope, we arrived at 0800 since the park was supposed to open at 0900 and it was already opened and running.  What luck, so we went in and did the new Tron ride (absolutely amazing and unparalleled in thrill factor, soundtrack and the unique motorcycle style positioning during the ride), Buzz Lightyear, Peter Pan, and Winnie the Pooh all in the first hour when hardly anyone else was even there.  As others have mentioned, this place is huge and very amenable to large crowds.  We had several meals there, the food was all good and reasonably priced by Disney price standards.  The parades were awesome, but the Chinese there were pretty rude about shoving through to the front even though we were there 15 minutes early and did our best to stand our ground.  At one point they even dropped a kid over my shoulder and over the rope.  The Disney workers were quick to see this though and shuffled the kid back behind me and the rope--shout out to them for all day the workers were amazingly patient with the few horrible Chinese tourists there, their line management skills were perfect and it was well organized.  Their nightcap fireworks show was quite possibly the longest one and definitely had the most fireworks, it was awesome.  Get out here as soon as you can! OH! And Pirates, dear goodness ride the new Pirates ride a bunch of times because there are two endings!"
1392,5.0,Jul 2016,"Boston, MA ",Must see for Disney fans,"Have a magical day!I went July 2&3, 2016Food:Disneytown has local food & western options. You don't need a park ticket to eat here. The quality of good at the park, Disneytown & Toy Story Hotel were all better than expected & better value for money. Wait until after the 6-8pm crowds. Bring some store bought snacks for the long lines. You'll be glad you did. Lunch at the castle with the characters is cool. A 3 course lunch will set you back $50 each. The food was tasty & having one-on-one photos with Mickey was awesome. Rides:Go early in the morning or later in the evening for the key rides.Tron, Soar & Jetpack after 8:30pm were only 5 minutes waiting. Don't stand in a 40 minute line just to get a fast pass.You will get wet on the Rapids. Wear a rain poncho or bring clothes to change. Shows:The Pirates Eye if the Storm & Tarzan are a must see. Don't let the standing only & Chinese Mandarin only discourage you from the Pirate show. There are some some amazing effects that make it all worth it. Tarzan is just amazing.Stitch is all in Mandarin only. The evening light show oat the castle is AMAZING.  My friend & I got lots of advice from cast members. -""Order your lunch at the hotel. We'l wrap it to go, the food in the part is terrible""-It's raining, you should wear a rain jacket-I can sell you one. -Don't go in, his show is in Chinese only. "
1393,4.0,Jun 2016,"Castro Valley, California ",Better Than Expected (there during 10th day of opening),"We had plans to tour China in June and decided to check out the new Disneyland on June 27th ( a Monday) given that we were in Shanghai.  Before we went, everyone was warning us that it would be too crowded to be enjoyable.  We are so happy they were wrong!  Disney did an extraordinary job with crowd control.  Relative to other times I have been to Disney in the US, our experience was very uncrowded.  We got there in the morning, took pictures, were on Tron within 20 minutes and then walked onto Buzz Lightyear, Peter Pan and Pirates of the Caribbean!  All rides were working when we were there.  A tip would be to try to get a Fast Pass for Roaring Rapids-- as that was the only ride that ran out of Fast Passes by 11 AM.  The new Pirates is truly amazing and Tron is super fun.  Interestingly, there were practically no lines to meet the characters, except the princesses.  It only took us 10 minutes to meet Mickey.  Overall, I did not see the unbecoming behavior that many people warned us about either.  My 11 year old daughter, however, when she was in line for JetPacks did experience cutting in front of her and got so frustrated just left the line.  I think if they see you as meek, they will try to take advantage of it.  So look people in the eyes and let them know you will not tolerate this!  Stink eye is an universal language.The night time show is the best we have ever seen.  The only reason I rated the park a 4 is because Shanghai Disneyland could definitely use more rides.  And there is plenty room to add them.  I do hear there is room to add 3 more lands!  Fantasy Land did not seem to have much visual appeal.  ""It's a Small World"" is sorely missed.  A ride like that should never be excluded from a Disney!"
1394,1.0,Jun 2016,"New York City, NY ",Avoid.. Go to Orlando instead.,After having a great time at Hong Kong Disney.. I thought I would finally be able to say I have visited all the Disney parks.  Shanghai Disneyland is the worst - by far.  The park is not ready - many of the rides are out of order and the cast members were no place to be found and the ones we did see were overworked and in some cases a couple of the lines got violent as we were waiting for hours.  When a ride breaks down the cast is supposed to do something other than let you wait for 2 hours..  I'll never forget this - Orlando here we come.
1395,5.0,Jun 2016,"Melbourne, Australia ",Amazing! Even better than expected!,"I attended the Grand Opening of Shanghai Disneyland and was at the park on the 16th, 17th and 18th of June. Given Disney's history with horrific opening days, I tried to keep my expectations pretty low. On the day though, I was absolutely blown away! Everything went smoothly, crowd control measures were effective, all the rides were up and running, the shows were fantastic, and the atmosphere was electric! The crowds weren't really an issue because of how large and spacious the park is - it mainly only affected wait times for attractions. For the most part, other park visitors were pleasant and respectful, only had a couple of minor issues with pushing and public urination (toddlers peeing in bottles or in garden beds).As for the attractions, I managed to experience most things over the 3 days, including a character lunch at the Royal Banquet Hall - loved that they had classic characters in royal style costumes rather than princesses. Stand outs were Tron and Pirates, which I rode several times each. I had decided prior to going that I wouldn't bother with Soaring or Roaring Rapids, which saved me quite a lot of effort trying to get fastpasses or join the ridiculously long lines. Fastpasses for these rides went quickly. I was still able to get fastpasses for Tron and Peter Pan around lunch time or early afternoon. Many of the single rider lines were not in operation, but the single rider for the Seven Dwarves Mine Train proved to be a huge time saver!I saw both the Tarzan and Pirates show, as well as the daily parade and of course the night time spectacular, Ignite the Dream. All shows were well executed and were of the high quality that I've come to expect. The language barrier did prove to be a bit of a nuisance at the Pirates show, but didn't affect any of the others. Tarzan in particular was amazing, and I just loved Ignite the Dream. It's possible to get a reasonable spot to watch this show without waiting too long if you go a little bit to the side of the castle. If you want to see it in all its glory though, you'll need to get your spot right in front about an hour in advance of the show. Other shows didn't require much wait, and I was able to get in pretty much at the last minute.Lines for characters were generally short, especially the character spot in Adventure Isle. I met Minnie, Pluto, Goofy, Daisy, King Louie, Baloo, Timon, Rafiki and Jack Sparrow, all with minimal wait. I also met Aurora, Mickey, Minnie, Daisy and Donald (all in their royal outfits) at the character lunch.I stayed one night in each hotel and loved both! I'll be reviewing them separately. I think it's definitely worth staying onsite if you are a huge Disney fan and are planning to spend multiple days at the park. The shuttle buses are regular, even in the middle of the day, and it's easy to go back to the hotel for a break in the afternoon. It's not convenient for anything else though, so if you've also got a few days to explore Shanghai, I'd move to a hotel in the city. It's very easy to get around on the metro."
1396,5.0,May 2016,"Twin Cities, MN ",Best Disney yet!,"Wow, is the Disneyland in Shanghai impressive!  We were fortunate enough to experience it during their soft opening before it opened to the public.  The castle is HUUUGE.  I believe it is their biggest one...the rides are incredible...the new Pirates of the Caribbean (yes, it is in Chinese), the visual effects blow out of the water the one in Orlando.  Soaring the Horizon is Unbelievable with the best technology.  You really feel that you are gliding across the countrysides...and the new ride TRON...how cool!  China certainly rolled out the red carpet and the people working there are great.  Highly recommend checking it out!"

The rides are definitely amazing! I waited only 15 min for the Pirates of the Caribbean ride! Definitely ride Tron watch a show and more importantly buy products! If you can... the Royal Banquet Hall inside the castle is a MUST!!! 
1398,5.0,Jun 2016,"Manado, Indonesia ",Fantastic! Better than the one in HK and Tokyo,"Live up to the hype. The ticket and food was expensive but they are all come with good quality and experience. The Tron ride was by far the best ride ever in any Disney resort and coupled with excellent entertainment performance, it was a wonderful experience. Amazed by Tarzan and Frozen. And the fireworks at the end was great as well. Overall really satisfied though expect long queue for some rides and better plan your rides well. Otherwise, you will miss a few like I did :("
1399,4.0,Jun 2016,"Davis, CA ",Love Disney - here are some tips,"My family of 7 (7 grandparents, 2 parents, 3 kids ages 9-7-2) were there for 2 days in end of June during the second week of grand opening. We picked end of June because we knew most of the schools do not officially get out until July 1st (not 100% true, many are out once they are done with finals end of June) but that helps beat the crowd. A lot of the staff do not know details of the whole park. IE when we checked in at Toy Story Hotel, they gave us the wrong information about opening times. Or when we were at Downtown disney for the first time, we were directed to the wrong place to get on the bus to get back. The security line opens at 8 am, the lines are crowded by 8 am. I want to say most of the crowd is great, not a lot of line cutting, but there's always a few in there. So that first line is just to get through security and get all your bags checked. Usually we hand all the bags to one person and walk the rest of the family through and wait (after getting to the front of that line). The second line is the ticket line. When you first arrive, you bring your digital receipt with QR code to that line. That same line will give you your physical paper tickets. After that line, is another crowd just waiting for the park to really open at 8:30 am.There's no earlier opening for people staying at the hotels. At 8:30, that's initial rush is to get the fast passes. My hubs was late ten minutes and he said the line to get fastpasses was about 1 hour long and all gone within the first 30 minutes. Other fast passess like for Seven Dwarves mine is easy to get. From 8:30 to about 11:00 I would say lines are pretty short, getting slowly longer when it's closer to 11:00. Cutting: people in China will squeeze into every open space possible. They don't see it as cutting. It's just something they are used to and what they grew up with. I'm from US and need my personal space. So I usually span the whole width of the line with one hand on each rail or wall to give my kids in front of me some space and that usually keeps people from passing me. If they do, I just squeeze in right back and they don't usually push back. Some of the rides have multiple lines: Pirates of the Caribbean and IE the Frozen show had four lines. A lot of the locals don't understand this and would worry they were in the wrong line if there is no people in front of them. It was great, because we would be able to get to the front a lot faster. IE by time we got to the Frozen show it was packed, but the 3rd line from the left was basically empty. The Pirates of the Caribbean has been dramatically redone and there was never a wait. If you come to this Disneyland, you have to go on this ride. My 2 year old went on it 4 times. Tron was shut down for the most of two days we were there and opened during the last two hours and I made it on. It was a fun ride. Camp Discovery - is a rope climbing course with 3 trails. No where in your travels will Disney mention that you have to have close-toed/close-heeled shoes to go on this walk. Basically you better wear sneakers. My 9 year old cried, and I used that to argue with the staff and they gave in by letting me come back with socks. Also gave me a ticket to move to the front of the line. It was pretty cool of Disney to accommodate us. If you like these courses - this one is pretty awesome. Shanghai summer thunderstorms: The weather in the summer in Shanghai is it heats up and heats up until it breaks into a thunderstorm. Day 1 was 99-100 degrees and day 2 was pouring rain. Plastic shoes like crocs - make great thunderstorm shoes. Bring umbrellas or there are panhandlers selling raincoats by the gates in the morning for 10 Yuan each or you can pay 60-80 yuan inside. Or what some locals did was grab some garbage bags and punched a hole in it for the head. (Some asked for it at the shops, I actually saw someone go into a garbage can and grabbed a clean one from underneath)Lots of rides were constantly shutting down including the rapids and buzz lightyear. Rides with the longest wait times: Soaring, Rapids, Tron. By around dinner time 5-6 pm, the wait times improve. And they get even better up to park closing time around 9 pm. Fireworks are at 8:30 pm. Food was excellent if you love Chinese food. I was a bit disappointed at the lack of turkey legs (the stands are there, but not open yet). Disney Downtown: Lots of shop and lots of restaurant options. If you go early 5-6:30 pm ish, you will not need a reservation. Even if you are late, I doubt you will need a reservation, most of the places were pretty empty In a nutshell: It was worth it, I love disneyland. Wish I brought a set of sneakers? or closed-toe/closed-heel shoes. Forget the fast passes, run straight to the rides in the morning with the longest lines. And try again around 7-8 pm if you haven't got on yet."
1400,5.0,Jun 2016,"Perth, Australia ",Disney Magic at its Best!,"Visited the week after the Grand Opening and was not disappointed with anything. The cast members are lovely, super friendly and willing to assist. Some do not not have great English but try their very best to help and if can't will get someone straight away who will understand. You will find that those who are learning the language or wanting to develop will approach you so that they can practice and learn whilst assisting you. If you don't understand just ask!The park is immaculate and is going through some small teething issues with some rides going out of order for shorts amount of time - which is to be expected of new technology that is being used for the first time. TRON was an amazing new addition to Disney parks introducing a new way to get your thrills. Glad I got to ride this as it was closed for 2 of the 3 days I was there.Soaring is a new version that the California adventure that used to be in Anaheim & Orlando before their respective updates.The Enchanted Storybook castle is huge and full of attractions, shops, the Princess boutique and teh Royal Banquet restaurant that hosts character dining, We did have reservations for this restaurant but decided to cancel one we learnt it was Mickey and Friends with one Princess as we had character dined elsewhere the previous night with Mickey and Friends in the Disneyland Hotel. Though the prices where good and it was a set menu.The castle show was good but mostly in Chinese so some of it was lost in translation.The park was deceptively busy and comfortable. Its all about planning your time wisely and because its newly opened using your fast passes wisely. It was so hot we just did the indoor shows and rides we could walk on. Visited Mickey Mouse in his location and was one of the most interactive experiences I have had with the Mouse himself having visited 5 of the park locations worldwide.I am sure most of you have read the reviews and horror stories regarding the soft opening prior t opening the main gates to everyone so I can honestly say after visiting that they are not much of it going on as reported but it does happen. Children going to the bathroom in the middle of the park - did see it once or twice but not much. Line/Queue jumping by Chinese visitors - it happened several times but my friend and I just did not allow it to happen to us and told them they were not getting past to join whoever was ahead waiting for them - they didnt like it but we never argued and just told them no and then ignored them."
1401,4.0,Jun 2016,"San Francisco, CA ",Amazing Park!! Staff ehh....,Great shows and so many fun things to do. Die hard Disney fans will love this place. Unfortunately the guests here are not Disney fans and don't get it.. Staff here are rude and just collecting pay checks... only a handful get the Disney experience... Hopefully the U.S. management I saw everywhere can help them catch up to the Disney standards.
1402,5.0,Jun 2016,"Seattle, WA ",Disney Success!,"We just returned from a 3 day visit at Shanghai Disneyland. We were in the park June 18-20th and stayed at the Toy Story Hotel. Overall a great experience. We visited SDH but did not stay there so I cannot comment on the hotel beyond it was beautiful and the service seemed to easily meet or exceed Disney's typical deluxe level resorts...it was completely booked for the opening weekend and we counted ourselves lucky to get any room on property. TSH was at or above Disney's US standard Moderate Resorts with Value level theming. Great service, clean and very welcoming. As a hotel guest you are guaranteed access to purchase tickets for the duration of your stay.Compared to the US parks, the admission prices are significantly less expensive and a senior discount is offered. Children's tickets are not based on age, but, on the child's height. Two day tickets averaged per day to be less than a single day ticket. When you purchase tickets they will link to your app, however, you will still need to go to the ticket window to get actual tickets printed out to use at the entrance. Plan to arrive early as the park opened prior to the posted time each of the days we were there.Security is very visible with dogs metal detectors and bag check. Metal detectors did not appear to be in use during our visit. Food and water can be brought in so long as it is sealed from the factory.On the topic of food. Bring your adventurous side. There is some western food, but the overwhelming majority of the food is Chinese. Everything we tried was wonderful. The park visit rounded out a 2 week visit in China. My recommendation is to embrace the local food. Soup and buns may not be a traditional breakfast food but it may be far superior to the""attempts"" at western food. Tomorrowland has hamburgers and chicken. There is pizza (peking duck instead of pepperoni) although there was a rumor of pepperoni....we never saw it but it may well be there. Ice cream by the scoop is on Mickey Avenue (main street) and there is a bakery that has a number of ""western"" desserts(cheese cake, carrot cake etc). The counter service restaurant ""Barbossa's"" located overlooking Pirates has some great ribs, they are not western BBQ and are a unique BBQ taste but very good. Bottom line there is plenty of great food you just have to reframe what you would typically eat. If all else fails there is a Cheesecake Factory in Disneytown just outside the gate located next to Tomorrowland. We did not eat here, so I cannot comment. One theme we kept repeating is that food in China is 90% of what you expect if you attempt to try the western food. Likely the Chinese people would say the same thing about ""Chinese food"" in the US.Do download the Shanghai Disney App. It is very good. The app is absolutely invaluable for updates on ride times. The park is HUGE and walking back to the area's ""Tip Board"" will wear you out quickly. Wifi in the park is spotty particularly in the ""Hub"" area. Wifi is good at the hotel. Do not plan to use anything that is google based in China. Period. Gmail, Chrome, Google Play Store....all totally and completely ineffective regardless of the data connection. (Facebook too) If you have an android phone DO NOT plan to download anything apps once you are in country. I recommend trying to set up a VPN before you leave or using a non google email and browser while in country. Once you are in China you are stuck with whatever you have on your phone/tablet/computer. The term Great Wall refers to both a physical wall and a darn good fire wall. Plan accordingly.Transportation is good. Busses from TSH and SDH are plentiful and move quickly even during peak times. SDH also has the option to take a ferry or cross a bridge for access. It is possible to walk from TSH too, but it is a significant distance. No need to add to the days 20,000+ steps unnecessarily in my opinion. We took a cab from Shanghai proper to the TSH (1.5 hr and appx 40.00 us)and from TSH to the airport (45 min and 25.00 us). Cabs are cheap and convenient. Drivers do not typically speak any English and do make sure you are in a car with a meter that is running. print out your destination in Chinese before you leave home to show to the driver. Don't forget to download a translation app as well...they are VERY handy.Do be aware that less than 1/2 of the cast members speak english. They are very helpful and will seek out someone who does speak english to assist. Please be patient with them and remember we are visiting their country, most of us knowing little more than a few key phrases in Chinese. Honestly, I was amazed at how well the Disney culture has been developed in the cast members. They have all been taught several key phrases in english to make you feel welcome. ""Have a magical day"", ""Good morning/evening"" ""Please and thank you"" are all expressed constantly. I felt that they seemed honored that we came so far to visit their park. Nearly every cast member greeted and said goodbye when we left a store. They were very excited to wave with both hands in a welcome or sendoff.The attractions: Overall fantastic. Plan to get only one fast pass per day. The were all typically gone 1.5 hours after the park opens. I recommend downloading the app and checking what wait times look like in advance of your visit on the same days of the week you will visit the park. While we were there the longest waits included Tron, Soarin', 7 Dwarfs Mine Train, Roaring Rapids and the castle walk through. By our 3rd day the wait for Pirates had dropped to peaks of 1hr and often as low as a walk on.....seemed incredible for what we felt was the best attraction in the park. (Don't confuse this Pirates ride with anything you have EVER experienced. It is Disney imagineering at its best.) I cannot stress the importance of going early and planning to stay late. Rides may close earlier than the park so pay attention to closing times for individual attractions. There are lots of reviews of individual attractions so I will refrain from going into lots of detail here.The park is HUGE. The castle is HUGE. Everything about the resort is bigger than life and it is all breathtakingly beautiful. Plan to see detail at a level that we do not have in any of our US parks. I would easily place it in the run with Disney Sea for overall aesthetics and attention to detail. Do challenge yourself to identify the Chinese influences in every attraction it makes for a good way to pass the ride line waits.The evening ""fireworks"" show is nothing short of amazing. Do take time to steak out a place in direct view of the castle. Too far off to the side and you loose some of the effects. I never thought I would see something better than DL USA's Fantasmic, but, I have now said it many times because the SDL show is THAT good. The projection that was attempted on Main Street in DL must have been designed for SDL and ""adapted"" for DL USA. See it early in your trip incase there are weather cancellations so you don't miss it.There are many open spaces in the park...wide walkways with areas to explore, a vast picnic area with tables and benches (and a restaurant that sells picnic baskets of food nearby), Alice in Wonderland walking maze, fun play areas for kids (Pirate's Cove) and an amazing ropes course for teens and adults...full body harness required.Be prepared for the pushing indicated in other posts. Personal space is very different in the Chinese culture as is waiting in line. We found that if we allowed space between us an those ahead of us we needed to stand shoulder to shoulder with a hand each on the rail to keep people from pushing past us. If you do not hold your ground, you can actually go backwards in line due to people pushing in front of you. It seemed to be pretty common and everyone was fair game to being pushed past. No one but us westerners seemed to be bothered by the behavior so we chalked it up to the cultural differences found when living is such a densely populated country. By day two we let it go and had some fun with it. One other unique thing we saw frequently was young children (1-3) going to the bathroom outside of restrooms. Many kids do not wear diapers and instead have chaps like pants for easy access.Overall remember that yes it is Disney, however, it is Disney in a different country with different norms and values. Not better or worse just often times very different. Embrace it and you will have a wonderful time!Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. I am happy to answer them. Sorry for such a long post. I hope it helps some who plan to visit!"
1403,5.0,Jun 2016,California ,"June 19th, 4th day open to the public, we were there.","We love all the Disneylands! We were so excited to be able to get to the brand new Disneyland in Shanghai. It was so much fun, because basically it was new to everyone there. We loved the Tron ride. Only went on it once because it was too long of a wait for the short ride. Our very favorite ride was the Pirates of the Caribbean. Wow it is nothing like the other Pirates of the Caribbean rides. We went on it 4 times and could have gone more times. They don't have a lot of rides, but it looks like they have room to grow. The workers were so excited and very friendly. The castle is very big and beautiful. We went to the Eye of the Storm show. It is ""Captain Jack's Stunk Spectacular"" show. Even though we could not understand what they were saying it was very good. In the stores they are selling a lot of things for their Grand Opening. So we had to buy many things for us and to bring home to family and friends. It will be fun to return in a few years to see how it has changed and what they will have added. Only one thing we found bad there. If you like American corn dogs, do not, DO NOT, buy one there, It was gross!If you get a chance go. It was a lot of fun!"
1404,5.0,May 2016,"Windermere, FL, ","Excellent Disney Park, Here Are A Few Tips","Disney's latest theme park just opened earlier this month, but it is already in full swing.  We heard about a few issues in some of the earlier days, but our visit was absolutely wonderful.  The Park is spectacular, spacious and (unlike earlier reports), there was not a huge overbearing crowd.  In true Disney fashion, the staff worked really hard to make sure everyone was having a good experience (remember, this entire ""cast"" has only been on the job for a short period of time).Here are a few tips/comments...1.  Take the Metro.  The Shanghai Metro Line 11 goes right to the Resort entrance.  It is an easy ride in and out of the Park.  2.  Awesome Roller Coaster.  Do not miss Tron.  It is a well-done roller coaster.3.  Nice Remake of a Classic.  The Pirates of the Caribbean ride is unlike the others.  Even if you've been to the other version in Orlando, this one will blow you away.  4.  Be Aware of Cultural Differences.  We travel a lot and have experienced a number of different cultures and have been to other theme parks around the world, but we were surprised by how a few Chinese acted.  There is a certain decorum that is expected within a crowded theme park that I do not think these park visitors are used to yet.  For instance, we witnessed young boys urinating in public areas of the park (in fact, while standing in line waiting for a ride).  We also saw crowds rushing and pushing each other to get to their seats for performances once doors opened, not following simple orders of courtesy.  These were minor issues that I'm sure will get worked out as time passes.5.  Have fun!"

Ride times varied from 240 min on Tron at it's peak to ""walk on's"" at park closing and everything in between. We covered everything in 3 days even with the peak attendance of dedication weekend and grand opening festivities. After the surge reduces I think this can be a 2 day park on a non holiday.The park is HUGE. The castle is HUGE. Everything about the resort is bigger than life and it is all breathtakingly beautiful.

Keep in mind that summer weather is hot and humid....honestly our June trip found us wishing for the far more ""comfortable"" weather found in Orlando in August. Yes, temp/humidity at noon in orlando in August was equivalent to 7 am in Shanghai. Be ready. Misters didn't help as nothing was evaporating. Take a cue from the local residents and bring a fan and an umbrella for shade.The evening ""fireworks"" show is nothing short of amazing. Do take time to hold down a place in direct view of the castle. Too far off to either side and you loose some of the effects, same problem if you are too close. I never thought I would say a Disney evening show was better than DL USA's Fantasmic, but, I have now said it many times because the SDL show is THAT good. The projection that was attempted on Main Street in DL for the 60th must have been designed for SDL and ""adapted"" for DL USA.

1406,4.0,Jun 2016,"Hong Kong, China ",Grand opening - full of fun,"Visited this new Disneyland (Shanghai) on Jun 17 (Fri) (2nd day after opened). Opening hours on that day was 8am to 10pm. It's very easy to take the Shanghai Metro (subway) from my hotel to Disney station (around 45min, cost CNY6.00), and arrived there around 7:30am. With electronic ticket that I got, I queued at another line and took me around 25min for security check and park admission. :)Wow, the castle I could see was very very huge... I got the strategy as usual - go the Fastpass for the rides that I like first.... Suggest to get Fastpass for TRON (Tomorrowland), then queue for Pirates of Carribean (no Fastpass available there). It was COOL and exciting. Another tip is to download the official app (iOS or Android), that will show the waiting time per each attraction. Parade was great - got more cars, instead of 1:30pm parade, I watched 4:30pm parade.It's easy to find restaurants and get your food, average meal set around CNY80. If you want to bring your own lunch (packaged food), it's also allowed. Bring your water bottle and you can find the drinking water fountain easily too.Fireworks starts at around 8:30pm.Of course you can find lots of shops around.It's just a pity that unlike the traditional Disneyland, there isn't any 'It's a small world', 'Space Mountain', 'Haunted Mansion',..etc. in Shanghai. You can still find some unique attraction that you cannot find at other Disneyland.I've spent 11 hours there, and I think it's better to spend 2 days there."
1407,4.0,Jun 2016,"Shanghai Region, China ","Grand Opening 1st week - Great Place, be aware of closed rides","Wen't on June 21st, 6th day after Great Opening.-TOO BAD DISNEY SHANGHAI TRON RIDE WAS CLOSED!!!!! and the personnel since the morning keep telling that probably in 1-2 hrs will restart, it was the same message the whole day!!!!!, I can only imagine that it was on maintenance since the previous day Shanghai was hit with huge raining shower, probably something to consider when planning to go, try to avoid rainy days since it could impact rides maintenance schedule. So, after this hard time, the rest of the place is great, so here a few tips for 1st timers on this place:-When planning to go, subway station will offer the shortest walk to the entrance (6 min), followed by taxi drop off area (15 min) and then parking lots (15-20) depending on where you ended up parking.-Upon arrival to the entrance gate, if you bought tickets through Disney webpage, just need to present confirmation numbers (printed on on your mobile) and ID (of the person who bough the tickets), at the gate they will look for the reservation based on the ID and print out the tickets, no need to pick them up on any other place.- Once inside, 1st thing, go at get your Fast Pass for the TRON or The Soaring Over horizons, are the ones that are most crowded with 60-120 min waiting time!!, you can only get one at a time and  you are able to get a 2nd once the 1st FP time starts, so be careful on selecting which FP you request since it can block you for the whole time without been able to get a 2nd one.- Download the APP, it get's you live information on waiting times and maps- Most staff speak english, some of them not totally fluent but enough to communicate- Opening time officially is at 9:00 during the week, but they are letting go inside since 8:00 so plan to arrive around 8:00 so you can go through the safety gate and then main entrance and avoid crowds.- Be prepared to face some closed rides, could be temporarily for a few hours or the whole day like my case- Waiting times, could get up to over 200 min for the main 2 rides that I mentioned, so get the FP's, others are below 90 min average, get the APP and you can decide where to go depending on the time of the day.- MUST RIDES: TRON, Pirates of the Caribbean, Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, Soaring Over the Horizon (IMAX type), Buzz lightyear- Shows and places: Star Wars Launch Bay for the fans, Frozen and Tarzan show plays.   - Food prices at Stargazer Grill (next to Tron and above Buzz lightyear ride): Kids menu (chicken+rice+water)= 60 CNY, Hamburger+fries+drink= 80 CNY- I suggest to visit during weekdays monday-wednesday, crowd was not bad, I can't imagine during weekend should be a nightmare- Inside the park you can rent strollers- At all toilet locations you can refill your water bottle"
1408,3.0,Jun 2016,"Shanghai, China",Disney Shanghai Opening Weekend,"I was there on Saturday, 6-18th. I'm from SoCal so grew up with Disney Anaheim. The Good: Big and spacious, saw open areas for expansion. Prices, after exchange rate, very favorable to dollar and euro. Courteous cast members with pretty decent English. Pirates of Carribean was worth the ticket itself. AMAZING! The WorkOut Trail, very cool. The Chinese loved the turkey legs (about $8US, the line was huge! Now the Bad: No Autopia! No Submarine Ride! and NO NO Haunted House! Long wait, FastPass only for a few attractions. Long waits (average 120 minute lines) but I credit opening weekend.The Worst:Line cutting, yes! Loud talking, yes! Spitting and Littering, of course! Everybody has their faces buried in their phone. Kids peeing in the bushes, check! TRON broke down and a few locals started arguments with TRON staff. Security had to start barricades.Bottom Line:  Just to say you've been, yes.  Bring patience and relaxed cultural attitudes."
1409,3.0,May 2016,"Frisco, TX ",Soft Opening - long lines and growing pains,"Long story short: this is a beautiful park, but - as could be expected - it is extremely crowded. This review is written after a visit during their soft opening, when it was not at capacity. We are a Western family who has visited Disney in LA, Florida, Tokyo and Hong Kong.The Shanghai Disney park itself is very well laid out with the big rides spread throughout the large park footprint. This helps with the crowds, but is challenging with small children - be sure to have a stroller.During our visit we were able to ride Tron, Seven Dwarves and the Pirates ride, along with many of the smaller rides (teacups/honeypots, Peter Pan, Buzz Lightyear, etc). We were able to ride so many because we arrived at the park 30 min prior to official opening and they had the gates open - this allowed us to beat the crowds. Well worth waking up early because by 2 pm, all lines were 2-3 hours long.Several weeks prior to opening, there are still some details to be fixed. For instance, we stood in line to ride the Seven Dwarves in the afternoon and the wait estimate was listed at 60 min. 1 hr and 45 min later, we were able to ride.... typically Disney is excellent at setting wait time expectations but Shanghai Disney has to content with ""crowd education"". In this case, the ride has 2 seats per row..... but the staff was trained to line up 4 at a time. This is to ensure that loading time is minimized by avoiding the transit time from the front of the line to the back of the train, etc. BUT, in China, when there are 4 people in line for 2 seats, no one waits. Instead, 4 people try to sit in 2 seats. And then it takes quite a lot of time to explain to them that they don't have to sit in each other's lap! This is why the wait times are even longer than advertised ....And, the construction challenges are also visible. We came on a rainy day which exposed several issues. For starters, 2 of the major attraction rides were not running. When asked why, the staff said ""electrified"". There was water coming from live light sockets on the honeypot ride. And, there was some sort of short in the Seven Dwarves during the afternoon because instead of rainbow jewels and smiling faces, the tunnel was pitch black (we rode it 3 times and it was fine in the morning ... issue was in the afternoon).One bright spot is the eateries. Food at this Disney Resort is much more reasonably priced than any of the others that we have attended. And the service was very good - lots of smiles and help!I rated this Disney as average because there were enough great memories to offset the overall pain. Admittedly, I dislike crowds, so this review may be more negative than the resort deserves. So, in summary, expect it to be crowded, arrive early and be patient."
1410,5.0,May 2016,N/A,Shanghai Disney Resort - Trial Operations,It was an awesome and amazing experience with my family. There were lots of fun rides and the place was really beautiful. Just make sure you know what ride or attraction you want to go to since there will be lots of waiting time with the rides. We were so impressed with Soaring Over the Horizon. Even if the wait was long still it was worth the wait.
