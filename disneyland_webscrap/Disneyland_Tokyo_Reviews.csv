1,5,22-Apr,Ukraine,Wonderful,"Wonderful! Even though It was rainy Sunday, there were full of stories and magical sighting seeings!Not so long waiting time for each attraction. Food from Chinese restaurant, named by China voyager, so quite good.Many of staff were welcoming and nice enough to enjoy all. No English voice guide, but it was easy to fully involved into with very well known Disney‚Äôs stories."
2,5,21-May,Australia,Amazing!!!,My family & I visited Disney Sea in April 2019. As a family we truly loved it. The atmosphere was electric. The park was spotless. We found the staff to be incredibly friendly and very helpful. Language was not a problem.
3,5,21-Mar,United Arab Emirates,Tokyo,Great place to spend time with young children. Take tons of pictures. Even adults can enjoy the visit too. You can also buy souvenirs for friends n family
4,2,21-Dec,Japan,Very little COVID measures,"When we got there, there was a huge line without any social distance just to enter the park. Over 500 people waiting on line without any extra space near the parking lot area. Nobody asked to see our vaccination passports and the ""health check"" was a mere temperature check.All annoucements were in Japanese, and they just yelled as if it had been a countryside fair or something. I am fluent in Japanese, and despite the fact I asked the staff questions in Japanese, they would just refuse to listen to the questions and walk away. This happened several times while inside as well.I only saw sanitizing stations at the entrance of attractions and toilets. Nothing by the popcorn kioks.There were lines for everything, and it was overcrowded.Don't waste your money going there because everything is just a neverending row of window-dressing procedures. For instance, we were kicked out of a parade-watching area because the clerk wasn't happy with the place we had sat on‚Äîdespite the fact another clerk had said earlier we could sit there in both English and Japanese. The woman that kicked us out just yelled in broken English and didn't even try in Japanese.Food was also subpar. We had lunch at the restaurant near Splash Mountain, and the food was cold. Flavorwise, the food was good, but cold.We got tickets that were almost ¬•9,000 (roughly $85 dollars) just to be told that there were no tickets to access the Beauty and the Beast attraction. When I asked, the staff just repeated like echo pedals, the favorites Japanese phrase ""Áî≥„ÅóË®≥„ÅÇ„Çä„Åæ„Åõ„Çì/I'm sorry"" as if that solved anything. Tokyo Disneyland has been the worst so far. Very little carw about customers, excessive yelling, and lines for everything.Don't waste your money and go to Hong Kong Disneyland instead; the staff there are more welcoming and you won't need near-native Japanese to enjoy rides (the narration is only in Japanese, and there isn't even a chance to understand what is happening when you aren't fluent in the language). Clerks don't even try. They just vomit Japanese at full speed, and if you don't catch it, they just ignore you and use pointing.I would not recommend it to anyone, actually not until COVID is over because without measures, itat too risky. Their measures are window-dressing, just to do well statistically. In reality nobody gave a damn about distance, and when you enforced it, people would cut in line."
5,3,21-Dec,N/A,Not what it used to be...,"Nowhere what it used to be.  Have been going for more than 30 years and it seems to be all about pinching the penny these days.  You can no longer ride the major attractions more than once (Soaring, Toy Story).  The all you can eat restaurants are gone.  The food prices have gone up and the portions haven gotten smaller.  They have cut off Wifi in some restaurants to increase table turnovers - which is not a bad idea, but some folks like a little Wifi while eating.  Tickets are almost impossible to get.  The ticket scalping has gotten out of control - I believe they are working on this now.  The new attractions have been disasters.  Closing down 'day at the races' and replacing it with Beauty and the Beast is a Big, BIG BIG mistake.  They should have gone EV.  The attractions are not going full tilt.  They lie and tell you that they are doing  maintenance.  The stock may be going up and up but the park itself is going down and down.  Maybe this is the sign of the times.  Disney used to have great value, now it is just someplace like a park where you walk around in circles taking in smells and scenery - sort of VR ish.  I don't mind paying more for value but it is not here.   You are paying more for mediocre business decisions.  This is entertainment and using the Covid as an  excuse to take everything away while increasing prices will eventually make folks reevaluate Universal Studios.  Come on DISNEY, wake up."
6,5,21-Dec,N/A,Pretty place,"I really love those cute costumes and lovely dolls. Also, when I walk in there, I thought that I just like a child, and I can dream everything I want."
7,1,21-Nov,Japan,Worst online website,Online reservation is terrible. It‚Äôs almost impossible to booked your tickets here. Their website is useless. For a big theme park like disney they must be prepared in this kind of situation specially during Christmas and New Year
8,1,20-Dec,Pakistan,The staff is lazy and arrogant,"The place is good but the staff is unfriendly , lazy and arrogant. Probably i wont visit it again for the bad behavior of the staff. I  went there in July 2019, still remember my bad experience."
9,5,20-Nov,Philippines,Happiest place on earth!,"I visited Tokyo Disneyland few months before the pandemic started and so far, it's the best theme park that I visited.I endured long queues and it's worth it as their attractions are really amazing and entertaining. The park parades are awesome!Tokyo Disneyland‚Äôs highlight of the night where fireworks display gives bright colors to the evening sky. It‚Äôs a musical show perfect to end the night with a smile. It seems though that the fireworks are outside the premises of Disneyland however this gives a night to remember.Truly the happiest place on Earth!"
10,5,21-Feb,China,very exciting,"there are alot of thing to do there,such as rides. but you have to walk and line up in every station."
11,5,21-Apr,N/A,Excellent!,"Tokyo Disneyland is truly the happiest place on Earth. It was my first visit to Disneyland, and I was truly impressed by its magic. The cast and the flow of each event are very entertaining. Rides, shows, foods are superb!The I hope Japan will soon be open for tourists, can‚Äôt wait to visit Osaka‚Äôs Universal Studios üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and the Tokyo Disney Sea üßû‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
12,5,21-Apr,Japan,Great as expected! ,"Glad to visit! ... not so many people on Sunday 4th, 2021. Only 10-30 mins waiting time. But I felt both standby pass and entry request weren‚Äôt effective at all. The attractions which needed standby passes were super-crowded at the standby passes times and were completely barren at the rest of the day. I could get 4 or 5 (attractions and entry requests in total). And by noon all attractions and rides....etc. were unavailable. So in my opinion, this new system wasn‚Äôt made for COVID-19. In addition, using smartphones and APP at the park for mostly all the day made me so busy that I couldn‚Äôt fully enjoy with my family."
13,5,20-Nov,United States,Day After Engagement,"My fiance, her best friend and I went here the day after we got engaged during our 13 day trip through Japan. We went early on a Monday, November 4th but it was still packed. My pro tip is to purchase your tickets from the 7/11. You can use the ticket/coupon machine near the front to purchase. Their is a YouTube video that explains in detail if you have trouble.Also, most kids leave by 8/8:30 giving you about an hour and a half of little to no lines while waiting. If pressed for time, just got later in the day. Loved it!"
14,5,20-Oct,Malaysia,Really Happy,Ouh mh godd!!! We are veryy love this placee so so so so make me hapyyy with my friends we love to see Mickey mouse and more again üòÜüòÜ
15,1,19-Nov,Singapore,Racial Discrimination,"I brought my daughter to Tokyo Disneyland. Although this was not our first visit, it was however, our first attempt to wanting to take a picture with the mascots, in particular, Cinderella‚Äôs Fairy God Mother. Never In my wildest dream did I expect racial discrimination from the well known and loved Japanese hospitality. The Fairy God Mother and her attendants literally bypassed us when it came to our turn after queueing. Not once, but throughout the entire allocated time, only picking the Japanese guests. We were thoroughly shocked and traumatised by this outright display of discrimination. The representatives had shattered a child‚Äôs dream of a kind fairy god mother and the image of Disneyland, where dreams come true in the Land of Happiness. It was simply heartbreaking.I was trained in the service industry with a Japanese Airline previously as cabin crew, and I understand fully well the importance of customer satisfaction in the Japanese context. Disneyland Tokyo totally lacked professionalism in this aspect.  This incident had been extremely disappointing and had left us with a very bitter aftertaste."
16,4,20-Mar,Poland,As good as the real thing,"We have been to the Disney park in USA and I have to say, we enjoyed this just as much. All the rides are also duplicates of the American rides. Rollocaosters galore, and great live entertainment. Very fun."
17,5,19-Dec,Singapore,Indeed the Happiest Place on Earth!,"Both kids and adults will love this place! I didn‚Äôt think I will enjoy as much as I did! I was even a little bit emotional, nearly cried(tears of Joy!) when the parade started! Haha! The lights parade was amazing! We traveled in Dec 2019 and I‚Äôm just writing this review now so I actually don‚Äôt remember the rides that we took but I still remember the joyful feeling. Even just strolling the place was great! ‚ù§Ô∏èThe only downside when we were there is that the Disney castle was closed. So that‚Äôs sad but overall still a great experience! "
18,3,20-Sep,France,It‚Äôs a small world ,"The overall experience is what you can expect from Disneyland parks except a few things...First - impossible to buy a ticket online of you don‚Äôt own a japanese bank card. We live in Japan right now but own a french bank card (VISA). Contacted the customer service, but no solution was proposed and we had to contact a ticket booker and pay more to get tickets. Surprising as it‚Äôs Disneyland.During our day in the park, we had some weird experiences. When in lines, we constantly got interupted by staff asking to stay on floor marks to respect social distancing (we were respecting social distancing and it was obviously meant to make us feel uncomfortable...).In the haunted mansion, I stopped just a few seconds in the stretch room to have a quick look at the decor. Immediately, the staff lady ran to me and asked me to move away and to keep walking. (Making the ¬´¬†move away¬†¬ª gesture with her hands). As if I was doing something really really bad.Same happened in Big thunder moutain.At night, during the parade, as we got closer to the show, a staff lady in charge of social distancing stopped us (she litteraly blocked me by standing before me). Only us. When I asked why. She answered ¬´¬†please stop¬†¬ª. I asked again. She answered ¬´¬†social distancing¬†¬ª. People were keeping on passing by / watching the show but us two had to walk back. No effort were made to communicate in simple japanese or english...I am more than concerned and thankful for all the work they are doing right now with the covid situation. But it shouldn‚Äôt allow weird / unfair behaviors that make us feel as bad or very rude people... Anyway, that‚Äôs the first time in my life I feel embarrassed in a disneyland park.It‚Äôs a small world after all - but behave with caution if you are a foreigner right now (and even if it‚Äôs your birthday üëçüèª)"
19,5,19-Nov,United States,Bigger Scale Version of California's Disneyland,"All the things you love about US Disneyland, but BIGGER. I definitely felt like I could find my way around because I'm familiar with California's park. But Tokyo Disneyland does everything bigger. I love the Nostalgia of the old Country Bear Jamboree show still existing, the Swiss Family Robsinson tree still intact, the Cinderella version of the Castle. All the buidlings, walkways, lands are just larger, more updated. It's a fantastic park, and easy access from DisneySea."
20,5,19-Jul,United Kingdom,Great Disney Park,"Its not big, about the size of Disneyland Paris, you will see  a lot of familiar stuff, and a lot of stuff you will never seen before with a Japanese twist."
21,5,19-Jul,Japan,Happiest place‚ù§Ô∏è,I went to Tokyo Disneyland last year and it is a magical place. Staff are all awesome and friendly. I would highly recommend anyone wanting to try to go. 
22,1,20-Feb,Philippines,Not for foreigners,"We went there on a Wednesday it was still too crowded filled with students and Japanese youth. Could not find any shows in English language. I know we‚Äôre in Japan but being a tourist attraction they should have considered this. We barely saw characters going around the park for meet and greet . It was difficult to communicate with the staff and sometimes they would just shoo you away if they couldn‚Äôt understand you. You would see a lot of families with their poor kids crying because of the long lines and unacceptable number of people around the park. I went to Disney world a couple of times, lots of people, long lines as well but not to the point that you couldn‚Äôt find anywhere or any rides to go to. Tokyo Disneyland was a crowded mess. Also, the main castle was on renovation. Not too much rides for the amount people that they let in. It‚Äôs just not meant for foreigners especially with kids because you will just end up frustrated. The light show in the end was spectacular, it was the only nice thing that ever happened while we were there."
23,5,19-Nov,N/A,Happiest place on Earth,"Visited both Tokyo Disneysea and Tokyo Disneyland, both are worth the visit and each one offers a different experience. I will definitely return."
24,1,20-Mar,N/A,Park is closed - cannot contact Disney for refund,I bought tickets for our holiday and then the park closed it's doors. I have been unable to get in contact with Disneyland Tokyo for weeks now after sending emails and calling. I am due a refund but have no idea if/how/when this will happen. Awful customer service - and this is before stepping anywhere near the gates!
25,1,20-Mar,France,Horrible communication,"We bought 3 day passports tickets earlier in February for March. When Disney closed we tried to get the refund. No email sent to guests who booked already, nothing on the website. They announce everyday day that a web form will be available soon but keep pushing the date foward. It will be soon 1 month since they closed and still no possibility to get refund, the lack of communication for such a big company is really disappointing."
26,5,19-Oct,United States,Great but CROWDED,"Tokyo Disneyland is amazing, though very CROWDED.  My wife and I are huge Disney fans and have gone to Disneyland in LA (about once/year), Disneyworld, Disneyland Paris, and Hong Kong Disneyland, and Tokyo Disneyland is definitely one of the best. While it‚Äôs INCREDIBLY CROWDED, the Japanese culture and people are so polite that it makes the (horrible) experience of standing in line much less horrible, stressful and annoying. The food at Tokyo Disneyland is also WAY better than any of the other Disneyland parks by far! If you like Japanese curry, definitely eat at the Bear Country restaurant. It‚Äôs really good!Another thing I found interesting is that people are really into popcorn at Tokyo Disneyland. I too am a HUGE popcorn fan and absolutely love it, though I didn‚Äôt find their popcorn to be that great. (10/2018)"
27,5,19-Apr,N/A,A must place to visit,"Will definitely return to visit. I never expected that I would want to visit this place again but really, it brings out the child in you. And that coming from a lady with young adult children. My children love it too."
28,4,19-Dec,Philippines,Tokyo Disneyland,"Tokyo Disneyland is amazing and certainly one of the best places on earth but comparing it with Disneyland HK, I find the latter more fascinating to visit than the former.  My ten cents..."
29,1,19-Oct,Australia,Nope,"Disneyland , should say it all but this place is over crowded hours waiting on rides don't bother unless you can get front of line tickets which is hard they don't  sell to foreigners "
30,5,19-Dec,Singapore,Wonderful Memories!,"Tokyo Disneyland has to be the happiest theme park I have been, possibly also because we were there during Christmas Day.You will be surprised that visitors actually started queueing at the entrance before 7am(opens at 8am). We didn‚Äôt queue up because we had the early entry ticket from Disneyland Hotel that allowed us to join a much shorter queue. The normal queue was so long by 7.30am that it actually looked like some zombie movies where the zombies were waiting to rush into the park!The place is really big and the mood was really awesome. Everyone was in Christmas mood and there was a huge Christmas tree greeting us at the entrance. We spent 1.5 days at Disneyland and enjoyed most of our rides.Fast passes are important because of the crowd and I definitely encourage the using of fast passes else you will probably only enjoy just a couple of rides in a day ( average queue of good rides are all between 2-3hours without fast passes).It is important to read in advance and plan your route/rides to make the most out of it. There are also real time apps to advise on queue timing so that you don‚Äôt have to walk all the way the ride to realise that it is shut down temporarily.There are rides for everyone; from child-friendly, fun rides to exciting roller coasters. The parades are also very nice and both adults and children enjoyed so much. We missed the fireworks because we were in a ride and heard that it was super beautiful.Overall it was a very fun experience and I will definitely recommend this!"
31,5,19-Mar,Japan,2/29~3/15„Åæ„Åß„ÄÄ‰ºëÊºî closed from29th Feb to 15th March,„ÅÑ„Å§„ÇÇÊò•‰ºë„Åø„Å´ÊóÖË°å„Çí‰∫àÂÆö„Åó„Å¶„Åæ„Åó„Åü„Åå„ÄÅ2/29~3/15„ÄÄ2020Âπ¥„Åæ„Åß‰ºëÂúíÁô∫Ë°®ÊÇ≤„Åó„Åô„Åé„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ„Éõ„ÉÜ„É´‰ª£„Å™„Å©„ÇÇ„Å©„ÅÜ„Å™„Çã„Çì„Åß„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ„Åã„Å≠....we are planning for trip disneyland in next month but they are going to close 29th Feb to 15th March.now our vacation is gone. 
32,5,20-Feb,Australia,‚ú®‚ú®,A different world out there. Magical place to be with people or not. Recommend getting there early for fast passes.
33,5,19-Aug,Australia,Best Disneyland!,"I have been to Hong kong, Paris, & Tokyo disneyland and so far this has been my favourite. The park is very big but not too big, in my opinion perfect size for the majority of people to visit (teens, kids, young adults). Although not all staff spoke english everyone was so cheerful and smiling, signage really good, and everything was just set out well. Had a super fun day here with my japanese friend from tokyo, unforgettable time and would come back again with friends."
34,5,20-Feb,United States,the happiest on earth Japanese style.,"All the horror stories I read were not true. It might be because of the travel is down because of the corone virus. No crowds the longest wait for a ride we wanted to go on is 45 minutes. The employees are the greatest I have ever seen at an amusement part. They seem to be geniunely friendly, not forced friendly like other places. Most know english or try to speak some english. The only thing I didn't like was the lack of t-shirts and none available had japanese charecters, just english. Also no magnets or antenna balls. I understand that Americans are not their bread and butter here, but it would be cool to get a shirt in Japanese. It was fun to wave at people while on the rides. I did notice they camp out early for the parades."
35,3,19-Sep,N/A,Toyko Disney ...not much different than Disneyland ,"Pretty identical to Disneyland USA except with mostly Japanese people. Same great service, same high prices; worth it if your a Disney fan but not sure if it‚Äôs worth it otherwise. Disney Sea was sooo worth it. "
36,4,20-Feb,N/A,Tokyo Disneyland ,See notes on Disney sea...this was great park.  Not afraid to put more recent twists on rides including disney movie characters into appropriate areas of small world.  Handles crowds well.Surprised there were fewer clothing options when shopping.  Focus on smaller items like key chains was huge.
37,4,20-Feb,United Arab Emirates,"Busy, but a lot of fun...!","We were expecting it to be quiet on a Wednesday during school term but the place was pretty busy, with queues of over an hour on the bigger rides.However, plenty of the rides had short queues, the parade we saw was fantastic, the sun shone and it was altogether a great day out.The park is only 20 minutes on the train from Tokyo station in the center of the city so it is very easy to access.Loads of guests had made the effort to dress up for the day, which added to the occasion.On the downside, the towers on the main palace are covered in scaffolding and a new attraction - beauty and the beast, which looked spectacular - is not yet open.An excellent and reasonable value day out..."
38,4,20-Feb,United Kingdom,You need to be prepared...,"We visited this park and Disney Sea at one of the most off-peak times of the year. Overall we enjoyed ourselves but feel like we weren‚Äôt prepared enough and didn‚Äôt get the most out of it. Some points which are hopefully helpful:Disney Sea is by far the better themed of the two parks. It has been incredibly well done and has to be the most impressive park in the world. Just being there is an enjoyment, even without going on the rides. Disneyland is basically a copy of the original park with some minor differences (Main Street is really disappointing!). Crowds are huge! If you think the American parks are crowded then come here and see what crowded really means. We arrived 30 minutes before opening time at Disney Sea on a Thursday (not during holidays) and didn‚Äôt even get through the gates for 50 minutes. Be prepared for this as we spent 3 days at the parks and it wasn‚Äôt until the last day that we felt we weren‚Äôt a bit overwhelmed by it. You‚Äôve just got to go with it and except that patience is key!On a similar note, get there early. The first half an hour is key to having a good day because you can quickly grab a FASTPASS for one of the headliners and get in line for another one. Within half an hour of opening time virtually all the headliners have queues in excess of 100 minutes (again - we were there off-peak) with soarin well over 3 hours, and fastpasses for some are either late into the evening or have already run out. Regarding the shows - lotteries are run for the popular ones and you can‚Äôt access them without ‚Äòwinning‚Äô. Whilst this seems fair in principle, the reality is that you could spend all that money on tickets and see absolutely nothing whilst someone else sees everything that want. We were there for 3 days and entered all available lotteries. On our last attempt we managed to snag tickets  but were pretty annoyed about it by this point. Apparently if you enter lotteries for a show just before they close it might make it more likely to get tickets.Finally, we found the food to be terrible and a real let down. The snacks were fun and different, but main meals were both very expensive and incredibly small. As an example, ¬£12 for a (small) slice of pizza with a drink is the kind of thing you‚Äôre looking it. If it‚Äôs possible to pop out of the park at lunchtime to head back to the shopping centre at the station then this is highly recommended. Overall we enjoyed our time in Disney and the rating is based on that but in all honesty I can‚Äôt see it being fun at all at peak times. If you are only able to visit one of the parks then make it Disney Sea because Disneyland can be found at all the other locations (with half the queues!). The main points are that you need to plan properly for your trip to get the most out of it and that you need to get there super early in the morning. "
39,4,20-Feb,United Kingdom,Lovely theme park,"Similar to the USA and Paris one this one has a japanese flavour to it. Monsters go Seek is unique to Japan. Unlike Disneysea it's more for kids but still a great place to go for a day. Although some of the attractions are the same, the Japanese are very creative and take innovative ideas to the next level. Queues aren't as long as Disneysea but can still be couple of hours. The park is still lovely for fairy tale attractions and definitely Instagramable. But we are happy we did this as part of our Japan itineraryBut I would say if you only have a day at Disney go for Disneysea."
40,1,20-Feb,Australia,Disappointed ,"Fast pass system was a joke, it only allows you to use it once every 2hours. No maps provided on entry and parades throughout the day made it difficult to get to and from attractions. Variety of food was limited and any decent ride had a wait time of usually between 80 a 100 minutes. Staff were friendly and helpful. Possibly worth it if you have children up to 8yo, otherwise save your money.Steve"
41,5,20-Jan,Malaysia,Tokyo Disneyland 2020,This is the best Disneyland that I have ever been (compared to Paris and LA). The rides like Space Mountain are faster and more exciting! The animation are real life. Shame  that I did not have a chance to fo to Disneysea Resort. However there were a few rides like Thundermountain that wad closed. I would recommend it to everyoneüòÄ
42,5,20-Jan,Australia,Disney,Great day out it was a pity the castle is getting refurb but we still got some good photos of it. We headed to the Crystal Palace Restaurant for a late lunch/early dinner as they offered a buffet for 90min it only cost me $5100 yen for both of us. This disney is great and look forward to going again in the future.
43,4,20-Feb,Australia,Fun but too bad windy ,We had lots of fun at disneyland but too bad with the weather being very windy we didn't get to see the fireworks or the parade 
44,2,19-Nov,United Kingdom,Bit of a let down,"We opted to go disneyland sea as we heard it was the more aldut choice between it and the normal disneyland. The park itself was amazing. Very detailed and you can walk around marvelling at the different sections. What let's the park down are the rides. If you're just going for the rides like we were it will be a let down. Tower of terror was by far the best and that was quite quick. Stood in line for two hours for the indiana Jones ride and I can safely say it was the biggest waste of time ever. Compared to the likes of universal, the rides are for kids. Assume it would be a great day out for a young family but, although I'm a Disney fanatic, not for a mid 20s crowd"
45,5,19-Nov,Netherlands,Best Disney Parks Ever ! especially Disney Sea !!!,both parks are beautiful and intense ... we were there with the Disney Christmas Time season ... so Festive ! And the Christmas Shows @ Disney Sea ... wow! Best Disney shows ever ! 120/130 dancers and then a lot of Disney characters ... Wow... if you like shows... !!! Disney Sea ... way better than the US parks ... we fell in amazement into another amazement every time! oh and the little Mermaid show ... wow ... I worked 3 years for Disney Paris and Orlando ... but these Tokyo Disney Parks .... Amazing !!! oh an the Merchandise way better and the food and drinks menus so much more Mickey Head Style... Sooo Fun! instead of only the Mickey Head Style ice cream /apple / waffle ... thats way intense and more detailed and themed are the parks there üòÉ it‚Äôs Not over done! but beautifuly done more ... it‚Äôs the Best kept Secret Disney Parks ... because a lot of people still don‚Äôt know that there are in Asia 3 Magic Kingdoms parks/lands
46,3,20-Jan,Australia,"Expensive, crowded but needed to ride the Star Wars ride so was worth it","Ok, so we went as family of four with two teenage boys and OMG, we went in Winter so god only knows how crowded this place would be in warmer weather, we did a four day pass to give a day here, a day in Disney Sea and then either park for the other two days, unfortunately we picked Wed, Thurs, Fri and Saturday and the Thursday turned out to be a Public holiday although the Saturday was worse. However even on a normal week day in middle of winter this place was packed and you can not even think about getting a go on everything. The line up to buy a Churro was 20mins, I'm not joking. And woman be prepared for long toilet queues. We were happy to find wait times around an hour but just didn't bother for the rides with two hour times.Disneyland and Disneysea had always been something we wanted to do and as a Star wars fan I got my value from just that ride, but although I've been to Universal Studios many many times in Singapore, I definitely won't go back here, just far too many people. I imagine locals with an annual pass are ok as they can go there for one ride. But not a place to get value from as a tourists."
47,5,19-Oct,Indonesia,I LOVE DISNEY!,You have to go to it the best! You're missing out! See Micky mouse and stay until night to see a magical parade! Ride the roller coasters!  I had a 100% awesome holiday here with all the yummy foods and gifts. Tip: By the fast pass for space mountain and the famous rides! 10/10...
48,5,20-Jan,N/A,Typical Disney,"We went with our son and daughter in law during a recent visit to Japan and we weren't disappointed. There was a long queue for entry with many lining up more than 90 mins before opening. Once through the gates I would advise trying to get a fast pass if there is a particular ride you want to go on or you may find you spend a lot of your day queueing up to get on. Waiting time for some of the more popular rides was over 2 hoursAs in most Disney's there's a wide variety of food available with a relatively short waiting time for service. The exception to this is the American Waffle House, we went for breakfast as soon as it opened and found ourselves at the head of a long queue that did not get any shorter throughout the day. That said, they were worth the waitWe only spent 1 day here and managed to achieve almost everything we set out to do."
49,5,19-Oct,Australia,Japan does it better,"I've been to Tokyo Disney Resort (TDR) several times now and these are my favorite Disney parks. TDR is not run by Disney, but by the Oriental Land Co., and this is probably a contributing factor. A definite Japanese spin on park management. A few things to note right out of the gate. Plan, plan, plan. If you want to get on all the rides, try to be there before rope drop. Figure out what rides you want to go on first - aim for big ticket items (Pooh's Hunny Hunt, Space Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain), get a fast pass for one then sprint like an Olympian to another and get in line. Your first 60 minutes should be a frenzy round. Be warned, the Japanese park-goers do not mess around with fastpasses. Big ticket rides can have their FP's wiped out within a couple hours on a medium capacity day. If you can, stay the night and / or purchase a vacation package (lots of extra inclusions like fast passes and show tickets) which really help in getting the most out of the day(s).Make sure you check the schedule if you want to see shows or meet characters, because the lines start early and get long. Ride maintenance is posted online clearly in advance, so take a look at that beforehand to make sure anything you want to see will be open. TDR takes ride safety very seriously, so there are always rides closed for maintenance. Something I've really noticed here is how popular these parks are with adults. If you're with a group of friends or solo it doesn't feel weird to be there without kids. It doesn't feel so ""family fun time only"" as some US parks do, Tokyo Disney is for ALL ages. It's also quite a popular thing for groups of friends to wear matching outfits...literally identical items of clothing, it's pretty cute. If you plan it right, 1 day at Disneyland and 1 day at DisneySea should be enough. There are different ticketing options available, take a look on the website. Try to avoid going on weekends, Tokyo Disney is considered ""a locals park"". High rate of annual pass users who live locally, this means weekends, public holidays and school holidays are crazy busy. Outside of those times you likely won't need to buy a ticket in advance as long as you are there for opening. If you plan on dining at a table service restaurant (Blue Bayou etc), then you need to book in advance, these bookings open 30 days out."
50,4,20-Jan,Australia,Much better for older kids,"Much more food options than disney sea, and even better rides with less waiting times than disney sea. "
51,5,19-Dec,Malaysia,Magical day in Disneyland,"We were there on a 2nd week of December 2019. Took about an hour train ride to reach Maihama station, collect our tickets and headed to the entrance. Despite it was a Tuesday, there were lot of people headed to Disneyland (or Disneysea), tourists and local alike. We headed to the Tomorrowland first, managed to get fast tickets to 'Monster Inc' while we ride on the Star Tours. Space Mountain was closed while we were there. We managed to catch the Christmas Parade at 10.30, ate our lunch and waited for the Dreamin Up Parade at 1.20pm and the Night 'Dreamlights' Parade too. (Tip: get a seat 1 hour before the Parade starts).We didn't have luck on the Lottery for both the Shows (located in Tomorrowland), hence we skipped those. We queue up for the Dumbo Ride in Fantasyland and managed to ride on Big Thunder Mountain (about 40-45 minutes queue) and went for rides with less queues; Toon Park, Island raft, Treehouse, Western Railroad, Pirates of the Carribean. Towards late afternoon, we noticed the groups of tourists had left, we went back to Tomorrowland and ride on Buzzlightyear with lesser queue. After the Parade, we managed to stay for the fireworks far left from the castle-with-no-sphere-and-under-refurbishment.)All in all, we were filled with Disney vibe to the brim, especially so for my youngest boy, his first Disneyland trip!"
52,4,19-Jun,Singapore,Amazing Disneyland,I wont rate this as the best Disney experience but my 6 year old girl still thoroughly enjoyed the visit. We were exhausted by the end of the day. Waiting time for some of the rides are long but they are all worth the wait. The only downside is that children's stories or narrations are done in Japanese.
53,5,20-Jan,Thailand,Tokyo Disneyland & DisneySea - Happiest place on earth,"Both parks - Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea open from 9:00-22:00 during our visit early Jan2020.For those who be able to plan for 2 whole days to both parks is fantastic! If you have limited time, after  6 pm ticket will allow you to complete both parks even on 1 day. Therefore we would recommend you for 2 days plan. As our trip this time quite tight, we plan after6 ticket for Disneyland 1 day and a full whole day ticket for DisneySea.The evening ticket allow you to complete plenty of rides as shorter queue than day time and we really had a great time at Disney every single time visit. Please have fun and enjoy your time there. Cheers!"
54,2,20-Jan,Canada,I wish I could enjoyed much more,"We visited Tokyo Disneyland recently and to be honest I was very disappointed. It¬¥s so different from every other Disney. Long lines to buy popcorn for instance could be easily solved by installing more popcorn spots around the park.... so much empty space to be used (something that I was simply astonished ....how much money they are just not making). And they could also be more prepared and have more employees with English skills, they try very hard but sometimes the communication is not easy at all. And this is not what you expect when you go Disney. "
55,4,19-Dec,Singapore,Charming Disneyland ,"This is my third visit to a Disney franchise, with Shanghai and Hong Kong being the two other Disneyland. The feeling of visiting the park is always mesmerising and surreal. The wait to take the rides were long (ie. 45min) but that‚Äôs to be expected at any Disneyland. We just have to be smart about using the fastpass. One minor challenge that one might face when visiting:-  Most of the rides‚Äô narration are in Japanese. I am fine with that and am not ethnocentrically trying to insists that Tokyo Disneyland must cater to the English-speaking market. But it‚Äôll be nice if they had."
56,4,20-Jan,Australia,The usual Disney Magic,"We chose Disneyland to go to over Disney Sea as we wanted the traditional Disney experience (not enough time to do both).The park is a little smaller than the one in LA which is not a bad thing.  We also carefully chose which day to go by looking at the various crowd heat maps available and for once it appeared spot on.  Also check which rides and attractions are closed - this also helped us to decide to do Disneyland as DisneySea did have some major ride closures on the day we were looking at.We arrived an hour before opening and there was already a very long queue to get in.   We managed our fast passes very efficiently throughout the day and were intrigued by the amount of parades and shows the park has but also with the amount of people who queue and wait for hours for these parades and shows (great if you like rides!)Tips:1. Try and go straight to Poohs Honey Hut and get a fast pass or if you‚Äôre quick enough go straight on the ride.  No other Disney has this ride and even as an adult, I thought it was fantastic.2. Stay as late as you can.  That last hour between 9pm and 10pm, we just went straight on a number of rides.3. Belles Castle is opening April 2020.  We saw some of the construction and this new part of the park is going to draw in the crowds for sure.  We would love to come back and see this some day."
57,5,20-Jan,Indonesia,Best disneyland ever visited,Went there during low season jan 7th after christmas and new year holiday so the crowd is in its lowest. Love it so much since not many crowd and the waiting time is very short but just hate it when we visited it was raining. But gotta love tokyo disneyland which its hospitality staff and the rides too. The food also good taste not like on other theme park. Too bad it was raining so the night parade was cancelled and some outdoor attraction was also cancelled. Overall experience was great. 
58,5,19-Dec,Indonesia,Great Experience,"I was visiting with my whole families, it was very rewarding experiences, my daughters were enjoying the popcorns and snacks, the food was reasonable and good. It was always an easy access to the theme park. Definitely will come back again in the future."
59,3,19-Dec,India,Caters mainly to the Japanese crowd,"I visited Tokyo Disneyland in the evening. The rides were fun, staff were generally helpful but at times strange/ uncomfortable. Many can't speak English and nod their heads with a smile and laugh which only makes it weird. I found the place lacked soul (of disney cartoons) in general. Visually it brought back childhood memories but I couldn't get absorbed in it because it's mainly tailored to the Japanese people. I'd advise visitors to try their evening pass to get a good glimpse before visiting for the entire day. They should rename the place to something else, not Disneyland. Good visuals overall though. There was some construction/ repair work going on when I visited in December.Accessibility is highly convenient by train and it gets a bit busy during the closing time, around 10 pm I think."
60,5,20-Jan,New Zealand,Great Disney Park,I have done all Disney Parks bar Shanghai now and this is a fairly typical Disney Land park with all your favourite classics and a few new ones. As with Disney Sea you need a full two days minimum to fully experience it and need to properly use the free fast pass tickets. Need to arrive early as the crowds are huge (see photo) just to get in. 
61,5,19-Dec,Australia,Absolutely Fantastic,Visited by myself in December 2019.  Easy to get to by train.  A full on fun day.  Did a few rides. Food reasonable and good.  Had a ball and would definitely go back again.  Fun for all ages.
62,1,19-Dec,United Kingdom,200+ minutes waiting for EACH main attractions,"This was the third Disneyland I had been to, the layout is very similar to the Orlando one. However, the management of the facilities is an absolute disaster..There is a website which predicts the busy-ness of each day. We deliberately chose the one which meant to be less busy to avoid huge crowds. I was aware of the option to get a FastPass, however, by 10 am all fast passes were already given away and we managed only to get one for the Star Wars for 6 pm. This ride was very similar to the one at the other Disneyland and to be fair the attractions themselves very good. If you only could access them..By 10:30 am the facility was so much crowded, so you could not really distinct if you were in a queue or just walking around. There were 150-200+ minutes queues outside each main attraction, even before you get inside for another queue. Some of them were 10 people deep, which made it literally a huge crowd standing on each other's heads..Both in Florida and Paris, you could see plenty of characters walking around, most of the time, you could take pictures with them straight away. In Disneyland Tokyo, we had to queue for 75 minutes to take a picture with Mickey! The staff was rushing everyone and only one picture for the group was allowed. Bizarre.30 minutes wait for the ladies toilet;25 for the popcorn; local food place was so busy, so people were standing behind the chairs waiting for the others to finish their meals, so they could finally have some dining space;.Splash Mountain 180-200 minutes waiting;Big Thunder Mountain 180 minutes;Pooh's Hunny Hunt 180 minutes;Monsters Inc 150 minutes..People were sitting on the cold concrete for an hour to observe the parade. The staff could not properly explain in English where and how you could meet the characters. I would expect them to speak at least better English, considering how international this attraction is..On top of everything else, the main castle was covered in scaffoldings, which made pictures look ugly.Personally, I would very much question the safety and security procedures of this place. I don't see how they would be able to evacuate all those people should such necessity arises.Very much keen to ask Disney for the whole refund for such terrible experience."
63,4,19-Dec,Brunei,"Long Q, but fun time","Q was long in December 2019, and we went on a Saturday, so it was expected.We all had a good time there, despite the long Q and in the cold. Study the map (online) first, then arrive early, say around 7:30am, joined the Q.Target the ride you like most, get a FAST PASS by scanning your ticket. Machine will spit out a small piece of paper telling you to return at certain time. Go Q for another ride, then come back to the ride (where you have the FAST PASS) and enjoy the much shorter Q. That way, one will have chance to do more rides. Time interval between FAST PASS is one hour, I think.Bring bottle, to refill water FOC in the park.Bring some little snacks eg biscuits, sandwiches, to save some money and time on Q for food.Bring money to buy merchandise (we targetted those found only in Tokyo).Toilet, clean. Staff, friendly.Free Wi-Fi? I didn't care as we were all busy having fun.Enjoy, like we did."
64,4,19-Apr,United States,"A great stay,","Tokyo Disneyland was great. The hotels were very, very, GREAT! The fact the gave out amenity kits, and cups was GREAT. I just can`t stop typing GREAT! We stayed at the Tokyo Disneyland hotel. GREAT. NONE of the rides broke/stopped. GREAT,GREAT, GREAT! I loved it.  :D"
65,4,20-Jan,United States,Disney with a Japanese flair,"Cuteness abounds here - everywhere you look.  Also, depending on the time of year, people abound.  I had the fortune of timing my trip during the busiest time, New Years.  The parks are small, capacity is low and your patience needs to be high.Be sure to maximize the Fastpass options, even if they are few and far between - expect to wait in lines and only get a few attractions in per day, if you're here during peak times.Still, at the end of the day, it's a Disney Park (not owned completely by Disney corporation).  Remember, you're on vacation!"
66,5,19-Dec,Singapore,So much better then HK Disneyland!,"Getting There:-(about 41 mins) (07:06am) Bakurocho Station ‚Äì take JR Sobu Line Rapid Service for ZUSHI to Tokyo Station (Arrival track no. 1) ‚Äì then take (Departure track no. 1)JR Musashino Line for FUCHUHOMMACHI to Maihama Station (7:45am) (¬•220)This place is much bigger than HK Disneyland and also, so much cleaner and better in terms of the rides, attractions and the F&B that they have on offer.Definitely I will visit this place again!"
67,4,20-Jan,Australia,A nice atmosphere but some issues ,"My friends and I (who are all 23/4) came to Disneyland on the 2nd Jan. Here‚Äôs just some quick pros and cons Pros: - Bear ride / attraction was really fun even for English speakers (a surprising amount of English songs) and just hilariously ridiculous - Food was pretty good all round (we tried a lot of different places including Pizza Rays and the Tomorrowland Terrace) -Scenery is nice -The few rides we managed to get on were good! Cons:-The first few rides we went on we realised they put single riders into 2/3 capacity carts often. When there‚Äôs a 40 minute wait for a 2 minute ride is that really a good idea? -The parades are ridiculous. Every time there is a parade (which is VERY often) you are screamed at to walk in single file across the park and cannot stand stationary. You cannot leave some restaurants during this 20 minute parade....with everyone literally elbow to elbow in the park it was absolute chaos and very, very annoying-Only one fastpass every three or four hours or so which they don‚Äôt make clear so make sure you get the fastpass for the ride you want!!-Not nearly enough toilets. Queued maybe 30 minutes sometimes -In the restaurants getting a table is very hard. Make sure you get one before you buy food or your food will get cold as you stand and search! -Plasma Rays had a huge wait to order! -Overall we were at the park close to open and only managed to get on 5 rides due to wait times. We knew it would be busy but certainly not that busy! Definitely don‚Äôt go in this holiday period! Overall exactly what you‚Äôd expect of Disney with some improvements needed for peak periods. In jan wouldn‚Äôt recommend going unless you‚Äôre SUPER keen. "
68,1,20-Jan,N/A,"Terrible, worst experience for kids ever","Yes, its the busy season but when there are 100 in a line for popcorn alone there has to be problems. They let too many people into the park meaning the one ride we got on took two hours in line. We then went for food and saw the lines of 100's at each place to buy food.......as for the toilets there was even at least a 30 minute wait to go there if you were a male and the womens line was twice the size. Disgusting and definitely not the magical experience old Walt wanted for people. A 9 year olds dreams were shattered today"
69,5,19-Dec,Japan,Awesome Disneyland,"Tokyo Disneyland is awesome as long as you understand some things you‚Äôll need to know. The first is that lines for popcorn are longer than most rides as popcorn is life in Japan and the buckets are collectibles. Secondly lines for food are also extremely long so it‚Äôs recommended you bring snacks or find snack lines that are short, the snacks in the park are amazing!!! The park is beautiful fun and easy to traverse, highly recommend if you are a Disney fan."
70,2,19-Dec,Thailand,"Too many people, lines were crazy long for everything and we hardly saw and charecters","Yes we knew it was high season, however the number of people that were allowed to enter was unreal. The park could hold this amound but the attractions couldn't. Even to buy popcorn you needed to wait for 45 minutes. The attractions were OK but far from the best one we have been in before. There were not enough entertainment on the crosswords and it dodn't feel like Disnet at all.Last, it is winter and cold - heaters in the 90-120 minutes lines would of been nice!Don't go in high seasons!"
71,2,20-Jan,Australia,Very over rated,"This was extremely disappointing, the lines 120 + minutes for a ride or any show. The street parades allowed for some to sit but this included collapsing of prams in the space allowing for less people in the very small areas, attendants just wanted to move you on and no English speaking so had no idea where we could stand to watch the street parade. Queuing for food or toilets was 30 mins. There needs to be a limit on tickets sold each day for you to enjoy the park. Many other attractions in Japan that I would recommend before this.Very dismal compared to what the USA has to offer."
72,2,19-Dec,N/A,Long..Long lines,First time at Disney Tokyo. Unfortunately we didn't do our research when it came to waiting in line for rides and shows.  Please do not come if your expecting short wait periods...most rides and attractions have a 90min to up to 170 min wait.  Fast pass sounds like a great idea and we were set to explore this so we didn't have to wait in line for excess period of time with two children under 6. This also was a disappointment as we found out that we coud only book a fast pass for one ride which we did at 8.30am to have a ride at 3.50pm with no lining up. We tried to secure another fast pass for Winnie the Poo but could not until 10.53am.  That's fine so I went back to get a fast pass at the recommended time only to be told that I could not secure a ride without waiting till 21.35pm???Please make sure your aware of this before coming and be prepared to spend most of your day waiting in line for these attractions. If you want a good young family Disney experience without the excessive wait times please try LA or Orlando.Overall the people and staff are fantastic!!
73,4,19-Dec,New Zealand,Fun day trip busy though,Fun family day out.  Expensive and busy though.  Rides and park a bit tired and old.  Good for kids up to 12 years then probably a bit dull!
74,5,19-Mar,N/A,Disneyland!,Went to the park on Saturday and the place was super crowded! Did not get to play all of the rides even though we managed to get a few fast passes! Ended my day at Tokyo Disneyland with Space Mountain (I strongly recommend this ride!!)
75,5,19-Dec,Qatar,Fantastic amusement park,"We took the 3 day passport and I definitely recommend it, as both parks are huge ! Besides it was peak time ....so long queues everywhere....we tried to get as many fast passes as we could however they went off quickly because of bookings over the Disney app which unfortunately is only in Japanese !"
76,5,19-Jan,N/A,Loved Our Disney Visit!!!,I wasn't sure how visiting Tokyo Disneyland would be because l don't speak Japanese however language didn't matter at all here! We enjoyed our Disneyland experience to the max. It was super busy even on a weekday and you can at the most go on a ride only once and the fast passes also run out fairly quickly. Still we managed to go on the ones we wanted to but did miss out on 2 or 3. Lots of parades and a very happy atmosphere. I was here on my birthday so received a special sticker and tag and a free coupon for popcorn : )
77,3,19-Oct,N/A,Avoid weekends,"We arrived Tokyo Disneyland on Sunday Oct 27, 2019 8:30 am. However we had to spend most of our time queueing for games and food. In that day we can only play 3 games and left at ~6:30pm.If we measure Tokyo Disneyland in waiting time for quality of service, this is terrible. So please avoid going there in the weekend or you will have such a bad experience."
78,5,19-Dec,Indonesia,A Must-Place Visit,"We visited this on our second day in Japan and have marked it as a place we really wanted to visit. In terms of size, Tokyo Disney is large enough that it will take at least a whole day to visit but not large enougj to the point where you are wondering where the edge of this theme park is. Every part of the theme park is within a distance that is not too far to reach.It must be said that with a toddler with an upset stomach we didn‚Äôt really go on any rides. Though we went and enjoyed going on an It‚Äôs A Small World.The parades are truly something to be enjoyed. Perhaps those familiar to this part of the Disney theme parks can say that they‚Äôve seen it all but it is something to watch various Disney Characters go past you.Spread over the theme park are various restaurants and food booths. In terms of restaurant, I recommend Restaurant Hokusai and Eastside Cafe, both of which I‚Äôve reviewed. In terms of snack, I recommend the snack booth in front of the It‚Äôs A Small World ride which sells hot chocolate and chocolate glazed donut.Somehow it is more crowded in the late afternoon towards the evening rather than in the morning towards noon.In terms of transportation, Tokyo Disney has its own train line which takes you fromTokyo Disney to Disney Sea and then to the hotels. Note however that this train line is separate from the JR train line. To get to the JR line, you have to change platforms at Maihama."
79,4,19-Dec,Singapore,Nice Day Out,My family and I had a nice time in Tokyo Disneyland and spending the day together. We selected certain rides only as it was quite crowded that day. We would have loved to have visited the haunted house but the queue was extremely long - & I do not enjoy very long waits.Overall it was a good family day out.
80,5,19-Dec,Australia,Good for guys in their late teens/early twenties? Absolutely.,"Our family of five planned a trip to Tokyo Disneyland. The 18-year-old did not want to come and his 20-year-old brother was not keen either. In the end they couldn't think of anything better to do, so they came.We were there from 10am to 9pm, and every one of us had a blast.So, is it good for guys in their late teens/early twenties? Absolutely."
81,5,19-Feb,Australia,Great fun and super super clean lol,"This is a fun place and everything is so clean lol, people run around cleaning everything. Great for kids big and small lol, the train ride out is fun and spend the whole day it is worth it. Only a short train ride from town so easy if you are staying in Tokyo."
82,5,19-Jul,India,Great gateaway,Perfect to chill with children for fun. Interesting rides. Recommend to visit on weekends. Combo passes with disneysea can save some bucks.
83,5,19-Nov,Singapore,Still magical despite the rain!,"It was raining practically the whole day, but I realise many of the rides were indoors and we could still go on many of them. The wonderful thing is that all ticket holders are entitled to the fast passes, and the money we got in we went to the machine to scan for fast passes, and later that day, again for another ride. We also loved the Star Wars one, and didn‚Äôt have to use fast passes for this since the queue was barely 5min. We went on this 6 times! The scenario on the ride was different each time, so it was all the more interesting. Food was crowded... and it is better to make a booking for lunch at one of the restaurants the moment you arrive in the park. There are very few meet-and-Greet, unlike Hong Kong Disneyland, not sure if due to the rain."
84,4,19-Dec,Singapore,"Ok, but language is an issue for non Japanese speaker ",a typical Disneyland park with familiar activities. parade is fantastic especially the night version specific for Christmas and New Year.language could be an issue for non Japanese speaker as  announcements by staffs are in Japanese and shows are in Japanese too.
85,5,19-Nov,Singapore,Lovely attraction ,"A wonderful attraction for family and kids. The only disappointment is the Castle is being undergoing renovation.Guess I didn‚Äôt have the luck as the castle was also being renovated when I was there in 2006 (13 years ago) nevertheless, it‚Äôs still a great place to spend your entire day with family. Do note that you can rent a stroller motorized wheelchair so your children and elderly will be able to move around Disneyland. "
86,5,19-Apr,United States,"Awesome!! We enjoyed every ride, the shows and the fireworks!!!","It was a dream come true for the kids and for myself as well, we all had a blast. It was crowded but we didn't feel it. The price is way cheaper than the US and there is no VIP tickets. Although, in some rides the lines are so long, they have ticket machines where you get the tickets for the rides with the time and that s your VIP ticket,they are free, you don't need to wait in line, you just need to go back to the ride before the time mentioned on the ticket. The rides were great! We enjoyed every minute. I would recommend it for everyone visiting Japan with kids."
87,5,19-Dec,Singapore,A place of fun for young children,"Tokyo Disneyland is easily accessible from Maihama Station, about less than 10min walking distance. The theme park was crowded but entry queue moved quite fast, waiting time was not very long. I would recommend to get a map and explore area by area. We spent a good 12hours in the park as some popular rides took longer time to queue. But be sure to do some homework and go get the fastpass for those popular rides so that you will not miss out on the fun. The park is a colourful world for the children, adults will enjoy too. There was also the day and night parades. I would recommend to get a picnic mat and sit by the park areas allocated for visitors to have a close up view on the parade. The night one is not to be missed. The fireworks was amazing too, for a good 5min. Oh yes, don't miss out the yummy turkey leg! It's yummy. üòã "
88,5,19-Nov,Indonesia,,"tried to come by earlier knowing that it will be super crowded. but i didnt know to grab the fast pass first before getting into the attraction, so i ended up in a long queue for ALL of the attraction. the saddest part was the castle is under renovation i couldnt even see a half of it, and..... the fireworks is cancelled bc of the wind. this is the first time i traveled to japan& disneyland experience. obviously my resolution this year isnt completed. i am truly heartbroken."
89,1,19-Nov,Canada,As a foreigner I didn't feel welcome (others please keep in mind),"Dear Tokyo Disney,I was excited for the day to be able to be 6 years old again. However, I have to say it was not what I was expecting. I'm disappointed in you Tokyo Disney.It was 2001 when I went to Disneyland California for the first time. It was a child's dream. A great memory that will always last forever for me and my family. I will never forget it. But this...coming to Tokyo Disney, yeah, I can forget this for sure. First off, what the hell? I'm Canadian who as been living here for a few months now. I've seen and heard some things...I know. And yet, I wasn't expecting I would get it here at Tokyo Disney. I thought everyone would be equal. I was wrong. For example, ( and this happened multiple times) I stood for 15 minutes trying to get a picture for ONE character while so character kept pulling JAPANESE VISITORS right when they got there. I left after that because it was a waste of my time. Like seriously? Do I not exist as a person? I'm waiting  PATIENTLY! The characters see me, I was. They wave back, and yet they keep motioning Japanese people (not just children) to come and take pictures of them. Even after I have tried to move in for a photo myself. Not fair and very rude (shout out to the Incredible's family for doing this! INCREDIBLE!! Great job!) am I or other foreigners not important as a visitor? Do I nor other foreigners matter? ( and yes, I saw this happen to other foreigners too).You should be ashamed of yourselves for all who work here and ignore foreigners. I know most of you who work here are foreigners so you need to think about your actions! I had a horrible time! Waiting in line for everything was expected but ti see my favourite Disney character?! Yeah, you really need to think about your actions cast members> I feel bad for my friend who came all this way  for this place!Tokyo Disney, get a hold of yourself. I know you all won't sere this and I'm just one person out of 1,000,000,000 but this is the 21st century. There are not just Japanese that come here. People all over the world come here and should be treated EQUALLY AS EVERYONE ELSE!!! And I saw this multiple time when I was there too with foreigners being treated badly. We foreigners deserve better. Think about it. Please. PS.(only reason I'm not giving 0/5!) Thank you to the only character who made me feel welcome! Geppetto staff member, thank you for making my day, noticing me and making me feeling welcome as a normal visitor. You were the highlight of my stay. Also the girl who helped me get a rock star black and white scarf at the Pirates of the Caribbean souvenir shop. Thank you!! I still wear it a lot! <3To Tokyo Disney, I hope Shanghai Disney or Hong Kong Disney is better."
90,2,19-Nov,Australia,I love Disneyland but I not this one,"I can't tell you why it was such an ordinary experience. The week before I had had the best day at Shanghai Disneyland. This one just felt really boring and I left early, very disappointed. I don't know what they did wrong, but I wish I hadn't wasted my time and money, as it cost over $100 including transport. Also the imitation American food was way overpriced."
91,3,19-Nov,Singapore,Super crowded!,Bigger and better quality comparing to other Disney. All rides need to queue. Due to the size - please get to know the layout well to maximize the experience.
92,5,19-Nov,Switzerland,The happiest place on earth!,We had stunning weather so it was already nice! The park is well kept ( but at the moment there is a lot of construction undergoing ). What was strange was that it was SUPER crowded - we managed to go on 3 things and that's it. Waiting times 120 min and more and the next fastpass available was at 9 pm ( and we checked at 1 pm...) so yeah that was not pleasant at all and we were a little bit sad. 
93,4,19-Aug,South Korea,Had a blast!!!!,"I came here on August 2018. I went on Wednesday, so there weren't that many people. The wait for the popular rides (Pooh) were about 1 hour-ish. I guess that's average, since it's also summer break in Japan. I got my ticket from klook---and then went to the Disneyland station to get the ticket. I went on most of the rides, and it was fun!! Only thing is restaurants gets packed, so make sure to book advanced (if allowed--not sure about this), or bring your own lunch. I would recommend buying some lunch from the convenience store, 7/11!! I had the turkey leg inside the park, and it was good!! I watched the parade, it was nice to see the characters!! Sadly, no firework because it was windy that day :(!! Overall, I loved it!!!"
94,5,19-Mar,Sri Lanka,Amusements ,"This‚Äôs my third visit; still absolutely love it. Although it‚Äôs always crowded in every season, it is worth visiting. The staff is very friendly. You may have to wait in long queues for some famous attractions but you can also get fast tickets from the small machines near by. Delicious food corners are available & don‚Äôt miss the firework & parade at night, so magical! "
95,5,19-Jul,N/A,Magic in the air,"A rainy & humid day in early July didn't stop any of the magic at Tokyo Disney. Off we went went with our family of five. We all had high expectations. Our high expectations were not just met, they were exceeded.  The reason we had such a marvellous time was because of the details and the people. From the un-birthday cake to alien inspired mochi Tokyo Disney is truly the best Disney land there is. The enthusiasm of the staff and true engagement with the children visiting makes you feel like a kid again.We'll definitely be back!"
96,5,19-Nov,Singapore,Top notch Disney theme park ,"Awesome and huge theme park with top notch service. The rides are excellent and well maintained. Staff are very friendly, helpful and professional. The park is very crowded even on a weekday but the crowd is generally very orderly. Many food and beverage options, but you might want to make reservations in advance at some of the restaurants if you do not wish to wait. For rides with Fast Pass options, it is best to use Fast Pass instead of taking the standby line as it move very slowly especially for the more popular rides. Lots of souvenirs to buy, and there are also popcorn kiosks where you can buy the different kinds of souvenir bucket and different flavours popcorn. "
97,3,19-Feb,N/A,The most hectic Disney Park,"Not recommended for chilren under 12 years old. The queue is outstanding. Come really EARLY in the morning so you can get Free Pass ticket more. There is NO halal restaurant inside but Disneyland allow you to bring food or drink from outside. For moslem, make sure bring your meals. Water refill only available in front of Star Tours inside restaurant area and no signage. Kindly ask to officer on duty for water refill place. Moslem can pray on the east gate Guest Reception."
98,5,19-Nov,Indonesia,Magical park ,"This park has very many beautiful decoration. I come here during christmas event. The lighting, the parade show is very pretty and entertaining especially if you arr disney freak.... love it very much... it will be better if you know japanese because every single story is told with japanese."
99,5,19-Nov,Malaysia,A magical fun time at the happiest place on earth ,"Had the chance to visit a few Disneyland across the world and this Disneyland was one of my favorite to visit as I had an awesome and wonderful time in Tokyo Disneyland. All of the cast members at Tokyo Disneyland were very cheerful and very helpful which made it üëå and it definitely adds. To the whole Disney magic. Food was also very delicious & kawaii as worth trying. The rides were magical and even though there were some rides that had a wait time of 60 mins (though it definitely felt shorter than that), I didn‚Äôt mind the wait time because it was worth it. Worth getting the fast past for Pooh‚Äôs Honey Hunt &  Monsters, Inc Ride Hide and Seek as those two were my favorite rides at the park. Worth mentioning that these two parks are worth recommending as it is their top attraction at the park. A bit disappointed that Space Mountains was closed for maintenance and that there were renovations that was going around the spark but that didn‚Äôt deter me from having fun at the park. Would love to go back in the future once the renovations are done and to check out the new rides & attractions at Tokyo Disneyland "
100,1,19-Nov,New Zealand,Wouldn‚Äôt recommend,"Not the place for adults without kids! Lines are huge, foods average and it‚Äôs hectic with crowds. Left unsatisfied."
101,5,19-Nov,Singapore,Lots of renovation,"There is quite alot of renovations going on there. The castle and a few rides are closed for renovations. It is written in the website but still sad because we are unable to see it. There's quite a long queue for each ride despite us going on a Wednesday. Was hoping for more stitch merchandise but there isn't alot of it. However, i feel that the restaurants there serve pretty delicious food. There are different popcorn buckets and different popcorn flavors too."
102,5,19-Nov,United States,Better than Anaheim Disney,"I live in Southern Calif and have been to Anaheim Disney literally 200+ times.  Tokyo is better than Anaheim!  Almost every ride here was more extravagant than at Anaheim; way better (Pooh ride is amazing!, especially compared to Anaheim - way different).  Lines were shorter, prices cheaper, and good variety of food and drinks.  Loved Tokyo Disneyland!"
103,3,19-Nov,Australia,Just OK ,"Visited on a Tuesday. We entered the park just prior to 9am with only a short wait at the entrance. We purchased our tickets online and printed off copped to scan at the gate.Most disappointing was the amount of renovation work being carried out on the castle and surrounds. We were aware of this prior thanks to the official website.  Being in our 40‚Äôs we only went on the tame rides! And we noticed that wait times for the most rides were less than 60 minutes in most cases.Being massive Star Wars fans this was the attraction we visited first up and walked straight in with no wait time. We had hoped for some exclusive Star Wars merchandise to be on sale at Disneyland but were extremely disappointed. Aside from dozens of key rings, toy blasters and a money box, that was all. Maybe it‚Äôs a licensing thing?Other attractions we visited were the Mark Twain Boat, the river jungle cruise, and the train. I also rode the log ride at splash mountain and as a single rider, I was on within 15 minutes. Strangely this ride was closed in the afternoon. Having visited Disney Sea 2 years ago, we both felt that is the more appealing park. I can‚Äôt explain it but Disneyland to me just lacked the colour and vibe of Disneyland.I probably would not visit here again, unless some exciting new attraction opened. Disney Sea I would revisit. "
104,5,19-Nov,Australia,A fabulous family day,"Our family (incl 8 & 10 yo) had a wonderful day at Tokyo Disney. Yes, many of the rides stories are Japanese language but we found this did not detract from the experience. Disappointedly some rides were not available but I knew this thanks to checking online prior. All the cast are friendly, helpful and cheerful adding to the magic of the day. We loved Buzz Astro, Star Tours(even non Star Wars fans), Splash Mountain, Big Mountain. Miss 8 loved Snow White and Peter Pan ride. We all agreed that after a 1hr wait, Haunted Mansion was the lamest ride. The shows were excellent and easy to catch during the day.Yes, there were heaps, heaps of people but we never felt crowded. We got food easily and it was tasty. Pizza, ice cream and curries. Reasonably priced.We felt 1 day was not enough.My tips for a great day is plan! Work out what you‚Äôre family will most likely enjoy, get there 90mins before opening if you‚Äôre not staying at a Disney hotel,  and get your fast passes. We got our first fast pass for Buzz 9 mins after opening and it was for a slot 2 hrs later. We managed to ride Snow White, It‚Äôs a small world, the carousel, Peter Pan and Star Tours in this time. If you can, use the app and check wait times online. This helped us hugely.Don‚Äôt forget to check out the popcorn flavours and souvenir containers. We had a fabulous day and would love to go back."
105,4,19-Nov,United States,A fun Disney park. Unique in all the right ways.,"Really enjoyed my time at Tokyo Disneyland. I recommend getting there before opening, and prioritizing a Fastpass for the excellent Pooh ride.Shocked and appalled, though, by the cultural arrogance of reviews here critiquing the rides dialogue for being in Japanese. The park is in Japan, what other language would the rides be in? It didn't matter to me that I often didn't understand ride dialogue, it's part of the experience and the fun!"
106,4,19-Oct,United Arab Emirates,Stunning atmosphere & food,"After visiting all Disneyworld parks I can say this park is in my top 3. The park itself is not what I expected, since being in Tokyo a few days before. I expected more lights, technology, shows. The park itself is an older park, especially since it‚Äôs the first international Disneyland. But what made our experience was the atmosphere. There was no pushing or shoving. There was a respect for everyone in the park. While created such a friendly atmosphere. The staff are always smiling and waving and super helpful if your not sure of anything, they‚Äôll go out of their way to help. Another HUGE highlight was the food. WOW!! No only are the designs super cute (almost too good to eat), but the taste is out of this world. I would book a ticket and go back any day just for the pork rice roll. Definitely try it if you visit this park."
107,3,19-Nov,Singapore,Disappointing!,"My family and I was at Disneyland in Nov 2019. There were a fair amount of rides but quite a few of the rides were either closed or being renovated! PLEASE CHECK before heading there!There were tons of people even on a weekday. For a foreign tourist who does not speak Japanese, I will suggest giving this a Disneyland a miss. All the rides' storylines were in Japanese ... we could not understand the storylines though some may argue that it the experience of the 3D/4D rides etc.Foodwise - I think the variety at a single spot is not ideal (3-4 choices) but the quality is reasonable and cost-wise ... not too bad.On the whole ... my little one enjoyed herself but mental note to myself ... to consider other Disneylands if I want a better experience."
108,5,19-Nov,Japan,Real Magic,i was surprised and no words can describe my experience even thou i had only 8 hours to go on rides shopping and and take picture minus the eating and going on toilet break this is where the real magic lives 
109,3,19-Nov,Australia,The best thing is either broken down or in construction ,"So I went to Disneyland Tokyo and I was a little disappointed as the Cinderella castle was covered up for construction or something. My friends and I were like ok hmmmmmm all good then we went to go on splash mountain which is one of the best/popular ride there, that was closed so we went for the next best thing which I couldn‚Äôt wait for and that was the space mountain coaster in Tomorrowland and guess what yep that was closed as well. It was disappointing but I still had an amazing time. "
110,4,19-Sep,New Zealand,"Not the best theme park in the world, but not far off...","We've been to every other Disney Resort except¬†Shanghai and in terms of the number and quality of attractions, on the whole Tokyo Disneyland compares very favourably.¬†Splash Mountain is great and very well-maintained. Big Thunder Mountain is worth doing but not the best ride of this sort (out of other BTMs and the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars).Monsters Inc was fun and the flashlight effect added to it, though it means you get distracted and miss some of the animatronics, which are incredible - it is just as much fun without using the flashlight! The Park has one of the best Pirates of the Caribbean rides, and the Jungle Cruise was good and the drivers were really funny- even though we they spoke only Japanese on the ride and we don't speak any!Pooh's Hunny Hunt is super impressive, it's hard to describe other than its a different ride than¬†its counterparts elsewhere¬†in the world and they've really invested in it to make it amazing.¬†The¬†Western Railroad is also really well done and far superior to the equivalent railroads in Hong Kong and Paris.It has one of the best Space Mountain, its quite exciting and well worth doing a few times. Star Tours is much what you expect.The Buzz Lightyear ride is well worth doing.We really enjoyed the Cinderella rooms in the Castle, and its good to see the Castle being put to a productive use. The shop in the castle with the artisans is cool too.One thing that was really cool was how they added a Nightmare Before Christmas theme to the Haunted Mansion - this was really effective and added a great new dimension to a classic ride.The theming¬†of the Park is generally very strong, though not as stunning and impressive as DisneySea (though that is really something else - see our review on that). There are more wide open spaces than we were expecting which is nice. Where this Park suffers is that, unlike some other Disney parks, is not easy to do a lot of good attractions on one day, even if you get there early and are clever with your Fastpasses. That's because here you have to wait two hours to get another Fastpass, and Fastpasses run out early for some attractions. ,We also got there 45 minutes before Park opening one day and it took a long time to process the crowd (on a Wednesday in September) so all we got was a short wait at Splash Mountain, after which the Park seemed quite full. Though it must be said that in these respects the Park is not nearly as busy as DisneySea, which suffers from a lack of big attractions and also considerable wait times on the big attractions they do have.The cast are very warm and friendly and we got a few extra Fastpasses (Haunted Mansion, Roger Rabbit, Mickey Mouse) when cast members found out it was our honeymoon. All the cast seemed genuinely happy for us, which was touching.¬† Some wanted to take photos with us or for us, and gave us stickers which they personalised by writing our names and messages in Japanese and English. Individual staff members went above and beyond to give us a magical time, which really made us feel special, and in such a busy place, in such a busy city, that is really something. We went in September, when the public are encouraged to show up in costume. This was an interesting experience to see all the people in amazing costumes, but often they got in the way as they were posing for photos all over the place. A lot of the costumes were world class and almost indistinguishable from the 'real' princesses. The outfits were a spectacle all of their own.There are food options which are not bad value, and we really enjoyed the experience of the Queen of Hearts banquet hall with the souvenir mug and plate. The Q of H has the most amazing decor - it's worth going to just for that and you didn't need a reservation, we just went straight in.All in all a great Disney experience.¬†By the way, its only 15 minute easy flat walk from Disneyland to DisneySea, even though the cast members tell you it will take half an hour."
111,4,19-Oct,New Zealand,Night Visit,Visited in the evening on a pass allowing entry from 6pm.Still very busy.Only went in a couple of rides but watched the night parade and the fireworks.
112,5,19-Nov,Australia,Disney magic,"Seeing everything set up for Christmas made my heart nearly explode. It's all beautiful. If you are a nightmare before Christmas fan don't miss the haunted mansion! If you are disabled you can get your ticket amended and get special fast passes at some rides. You need to tell a cast member that you are disabled and you need to register with proof at the town hall. If you have allergies some restaurants have low allergen meals, the curry was particularly good! Keep an eye out for some of the lesser known Disney characters too! I was delighted to see Max and Marie."
113,4,19-Nov,United Kingdom,Great Visit,"A lovely Disney resort, spent a great day there. Staff extremely friendly and helpful, other Disney resorts could learn a thing or two from them.Not so many characters wandering around the park which was a shame for impromptu photo opportunities and the castle was covered in scaffolding but they were my only two disappointments"
114,4,19-Mar,N/A,Very beautiful!,It was very beautiful here since I visited in the spring time! The wait time in the lines were very long and did not get to ride very much rides but the shows were great! I also enjoyed the food! Eat eat eat!!
115,4,19-Nov,India,Finally made it to Disneyland,"I'm not much of a fan of Disneyland, but if you are travelling with a family then Disneyland is a must in Tokyo. What really sets it apart is the 'discipline' of the place, despite the huge crowds and serpentine ques. It was clean and the staff were exceedingly courteous and helpful."
116,5,19-Nov,Singapore,Disneyland Magic,"Amazing. The wait time was long, but the whole trip was magical. Rides, parades and the shows were fantastic. Will be back"
117,5,19-Nov,Colombia,Same as disney sea excellent,Very good amenities good attractions again avoid public holidays as waiting times in queues  double in size
118,5,19-Oct,New Zealand,Amazing,I was thoroughly impressed by how smoothly everything ran. Even though there were tonnes of people you never felt like you waited for long. It was an incredible place to visit. 
119,5,19-May,Philippines,Family Trip,"I personally enjoyed the park. Unfortunately, the day that we went here was raining hard so we did not fully enjoy the whole park because some rides are close but the good thing is, lines are not that long because of the rain. We made 5 rides in just an hour. LOL We will surely go back to this place."
120,5,19-Jul,Australia,Super day out!,"My husband, 7 year old daughter and I went to Tokyo Disney for the day. It was an amazing day out. Food and souvenirs are reasonably priced, the staff are super helpful, and it was a dream come true. I‚Äôd highly recommend staying for the parade which was phenomenal. I would absolutely go back!"
121,5,19-Jul,El Salvador,The Japanese version of the happiest place on earth,"I guess no matter where in the world you visit a Disneyland, you'll be acting like a kid. This specific one has some interesting flavour because you can see a lot of people wearing traditional Japanese attire, so it will give it a bit of interesting view. It has some cues (like any other Disneyland) but what do you expect?"
122,5,19-Oct,N/A,Always a happy place,"The queue will always be there, except for that one day in the middle of winter when the heavy rainstorm hit Tokyo. Food options are different to DisneySea and other Disneylands& WDW on the other side of the globe. Smell of fresh popcorns in different flavours (soy sauce and butter/ caramel/ honey/ teriyaki/ etc.) follows you as you walk around the park. Then your eyes are drawn to the ice cream wagon where they sell Mickey head-shaped ice block in tropical fruits flavour, and Minnie in a berry flavour. Our last visit was in October 2019 and they sold churros, Jack Skellington burger (Halloween special), purple potato hot bun in cinnamon, etc. But last Summer, they sold shave ice (Hawaiian style) and the mikan (mandarin) flavour was the best! The Alice in Wonderland Banquet Hall is always almost full, check timing first before you go.There are only a few restaurants inside the park however plenty of food court-style and street carts.Best non-classic rides for chickens like me (non-classic rides like Snow White, Peter Pan, Haunted Mansion, Jungle Cruise, Pirates of the Caribbean, etc. Non-roller coaster, G-force style rides):- Monsters Inc (shootiqng ride using flashlight)- Winnie the Pooh (bumper cars style, but you don't control it)- Buzz Lightyear (shooting ride, similar to Disneyland HongKong but slightly longer ride)If ever you are feeling unwell for whatever reasons, Disneyland's Central Health (white/green cross on the map) near ""Main Street""/ entrance gate, is superb and smells like Dettol. They have multiple nurses and doctors on site and are very professional and helpful."
123,1,19-Oct,N/A,Waste of your time,Too crowded. They should limit the number of tickets per day. The queue is way too long . The famous riding will need at least 65-85 minutes in queue. Food inside is expensive and queue is very long. The place is suitable for local citizen who has annual passport.
124,5,19-Oct,Australia,So sorry we did not stay for a week,"Oh my goodness everyone should go to Disneyland Tokyo. We were only there for two days but it was not nearly long enough. Do yourself a favour and stay for a week. Five days at the park would be perfect and two days shopping in the area. It is amazing, amazing, amazing."
125,5,19-Oct,Nepal,Best Theme Park ever but too crowded.,"My first visit to any Disneyland. It was amazing! All the facilities, rides, foods, parades was nice. Japanese staffs were bonus, very professional, polite and helpful. However the crowds were the disappointment. We purposely choose a low peak season to visit but because of Typhoon on the previous 2 days, most people switched their tickets to the day we visited. The crowd was crazy and waiting line was long. I guess the crowd control can be done better."
126,1,19-Oct,N/A,Disneyland Tokyo made me miserable üòñ,"No magic! No fun! And Plenty of waiting around! Don‚Äôt do it to yourself.This place is over crowded, which made wading Through the streets a chore.Theres barely any room for taking pictures, so don't bother. Most queue times for rides where between estimated at 50-90 mins.Theres large queues for everything including toilets and popcorn, even restaurants queues out the door and up the street. We managed to use the fast pass feature once and still had to wait at least 20 mins. By 12:00 all the fast pass time slots where used up or too late At night so you had to join the normal queues anyway.After sunset the there was next to no lighting, so you kinda need to buy a torch to make sure you don't knock over a small child.Don't go!"
127,1,19-Oct,United States,I felt death at a Disneyland park,"3 hours + to get into any ride40 minutes to 1 hours to get a popcorn No Disney characters anywhere 2 hours to get into a restaurant The food is horrible very very bad and no vegetarian menu.People were taking the seats randomly and you need to compete to get a seat.People start to line for a show 5 hours before it so all the good spots are goneIt‚Äôs all about merchandise whit low quality, I mean nothing you buy you felt that awesome Japan qualityNo space to take a breakMy your 4 and 8 start crying because they couldn‚Äôt even get into any ride. We‚Äôve got only into the tree which you walk in and that‚Äôs it.We were exhausted after 2 hours and went back after our horrible lunch. I wonder how they make those meals it is worse that‚Äôs the worse airlines foods.I bet Disney would cry to saw the mess Japanese people have done to Disney. Disney have to prohibit this park for proceeding.I want to sue it and get my money back for the horrible experience.They should close this horrible inhuman park!!!!If you love your kids I don‚Äôt recommend this park with you, there‚Äôs no magic at all you really feel death there"
128,1,19-Oct,United States,Going downhill..,"This is my nth time visiting Tokyo Disneyland and possibility my last. My last visit was 4 years ago, and things have gone downhill pretty much. Back in those days, only selected rides like Pooh Bear has queue times of 1 hour. Other rides range anything from 5-30 minutes. This time, Splash mountain and Big Thunder mountain had queue times of 3 hours! This is crazy. The queue snaked all the way down to the streets, past restaurants. As we were with some friends who were visiting Tokyo Disneyland for the first time, we bite our teeth and joined the queue. It didn‚Äôt take us 3hours to reach the front, it took us 2.5hours, this should be some consolation.  Even the queues into the characters‚Äô hones has 1.5 hours queue times. So we were the from the park opening and closing, we completed a grand total of 3 rides, watched 2 parades and had lunch. Parades were still good and their decorations according to the Seasons/holidays were beautiful, better than HK‚Äôs Disneyland. I do think Disney has lost the magic somewhat. Staff seem less friendly and smiley than before. Disney need to start looking into limiting the number of visitors. Until then, I probably wouldn‚Äôt be back, which is a shame as I really hope to bring my kids here. "
129,2,19-Oct,United Kingdom,Who Disney like queuing?,"Had been excited to visit here for a long time, but were left disappointed.  Went on a monday in October and it was far too busy.  Most rides well over 2hrs wait, toilets queued out ofbthe door and over 20mins wait for ladies, 10mins for popcorn, 30mins for pizza.  Even walking around was difficult and did not feel safe.The other disapointment was a lot of building/renovation work was ongoing so lots of scaffolding and tarpaulins everywhere, which detracted somevwhat from the ""Magic"". Disappointed, won't be back or recommend."
130,4,19-Sep,Indonesia,Disneyland...A Place for Happiness...as always,I came in Hallowen season...so Disneyland have a Hallowen Theme around the Park...different ambience. There are 3 parades since morning untill night...the parades are better than in Hongkong....but not many shows...overall you will feel happy in Disneyland...
131,5,18-Nov,Australia,A MUST FOR DISNEY FANS,A wonderful disney with some Japanese twists. I consider myself a Disney expert having done all parks other than Shanghai many times and i still love coming to this Disney. Although some shows are in Japanese its just such a cute park and the Japanese really love coming and get in the culture of it all. Dont forget to try their wacky popcorn flavours while you are there. You will be able to smell them haha.
132,4,19-Oct,India,Nice,It's a nice place must visit with younger children and they will enjoy this place just love this place whenever you visit of you must visit Disneyland over there.
133,4,19-Sep,N/A,Disneysea must see,Maybe we should go in at 0600 n leave at 2200 to enjoy all if not most of the Heroes dens... Aladdin toystory sindbad lost ark nemo n more n end with fireworks spectre in the sea!!!  Don't know if we should come back again... very tempting !!!
134,5,19-Sep,Indonesia,Fit for Hardcore Disney Fan,"Visited the park in the afternoon on a Sunday and I'm getting Starlight ticket. Still managed to hop in few attractions but some are fastpass worth like Peter Pan's Flight which is still 45mins wait even at closing. Electrical Parade is quite a show and everyone started to line up 1 hour before it started. While some parts of the park was under refurb, such as main entrance plaza and tomorrowland, this is a good park to spend for a full day. I wish I spent longer time there. "
135,4,19-Sep,United Kingdom,"Good park, but prepare for queues...","Great park and rides, including different ones to Disneyworld, however prepare to queues for most things, expect >45 minutes for most rides really, popular rides >120 minutes. Even snack carts had 30 minute queues."
136,4,19-Oct,Australia,Nice fun place to visit ,Well though out Disneyland in Tokyo and definitely worth a visit. The mid-day parade is the pretty awesome to watch and heaps of fun.
137,4,19-Oct,United States,Refreshingly different,"I‚Äôm not the amusement park kind of guy, but I did enjoy a day at Tokyo Disneyland. It‚Äôs clean, orderly compared to either Orlando or LA. The most surprising thing we‚Äôre all the people dressed up to enjoy a Disneyland day. The costumes, the ears. Clearly this is not just a destination location but a regular experience for locals. It was great. Though... it was strange hearing capt Jack speaking in Japanese."
138,5,19-Aug,N/A,Tokyo Disney Sea,"Had a GREAT time at Tokyo Disneyland and Disney Sea. We spent 1 full day at each park. If you have only 1 day open, spend it at Disney Sea. It's a very unique park with many unique attractions. Very hot and humid and crowded in the summer. Go in spring or fall when the weather is more comfortable. "
139,5,19-Jul,N/A,Nostalgic and different!,"Growing up in San Diego, California, US, I've been to Disneyland many, many, times, and I've always loved it!  Tokyo Disneyland was just different enough to make the experience new and exciting, and just similar enough to make me feel right at home in another land!"
140,5,19-May,N/A,Best day,Although it was raining it didn't dampen the spirits of the kids and kids at heart. Everything we wanted to do was available to us. An awesome experience.
141,5,18-Dec,Indonesia,Wow Disneyland!!!,"I went to Tokyo Disneyland on December last year, and it was awesome!!! (even it's really cold) Definitely will go back!"
142,5,18-Dec,Australia,DISNEY LAND!!,"loved every second of being here! the train drops you off and its a short walk to the main gate of happiness. all the stores a big and such a variety of souvenirs. I went off peak season and lines are short. Fast passes avail by scanning your entry ticket at the ride lines, can only get one fast pass at a time. but love Disney Japan"
143,1,19-Oct,United States,TRAPPED in Tokyo Disneyland,"Without any notice or warning, all pathways were closed off for the parade.  For 30 minutes we‚Äôve not been allowed to go anywhere and the restaurant we were walking into closed down until the parade is over.  The parade has now arrived-it‚Äôs bizarre and doesn‚Äôt sound or look like Disney.  It ended with a nice sign thanking their sponsor.  Japan has been awesome-so upset I wasted my time and a lot of money to come  and stay here.Did I mention, when we tried to go into the Miracosta Hotel to check into our $650 room three employees blocked the entrance and required ID to confirm you were a guest. And, anything you were carrying was checked. A level of BS that was just about intolerable."
144,5,19-Sep,Australia,where happiness is,Had a great day at Disneyland even though my grand daughter was feeling ill she still managed to raise a smile and enjoy herself.The parade was great and as we went on a Friday it was not too crowded.Well worth the visit if in Tokyo.Easily accessible by rail.
145,5,19-Jul,Australia,Amazing fun with family,"Had a great day with my wife and 2 young kids. Lots to see and my son was so excited to have a photo with Mickey. The queue was long, which was understandable, but then the actual duration of the ride felt too short, leaving the feeling of under-whelmed. I understand that longer ride duration means the ones queuing would have to wait longer. Perhaps they could build the attraction to take more people at every batch?Staff were friendly and helpful. Some of them even speak reasonable-level of English.I got minor injury and had to visit first aid centre. Apparently no staff in first aid centre could speak English (maybe tourists other than me never got injured, lol), but they were quick to pull out their phone and open Google Translate. We managed to somehow communicate enough for me to get proper treatment. Good and memorable experience after all.My kid enjoyed the popcorn that comes with toy. Lunch time was also interesting with all those Mickey-shaped and heart-shaped food selection.Before your visit, make sure you do enough reading about the popular attractions/rides and prepare at least basic plan. Also, read about Fastpass, how it works, and the fact that it's only given to limited number of passengers per ride per day.Overall, still easily one of the best theme parks on the planet. Being in Japan, I enjoy seeing their unique culture touch to the famous ""happiest place on Earth""."
146,5,19-Oct,N/A,Great day!,"Great park,  a little smaller than the California one,  but about half the price now.   Lines weren't as long as I expected.   Weather was great.   Very clean park"
147,5,19-Oct,Canada,Tokyo Disney ,Lots of things to see and do for all ages although better for 5yrs and up as there is a lot of walking to do. Reasonably priced but expect to que for food and drink. 
148,1,19-Oct,N/A,Not friendly to tourist,"I have visit Disneyland jp since teenage time. Hence, decide to bring my daughter to enjoy the Disney magic. But beware, the customer service has dropped drastically. The q is terrible and even with fast pass, you still need to q and fast pass run out by late noon."
149,3,19-Sep,Australia,Big crowds is an understatement,"Purchased tickets online prior to travelling to Japan, which was really easy to navigate.  Went on a Thursday, arriving approximately an hour prior to the gates opening and the crowds waiting to enter was chaotic! Highly recommend researching the layout of the park prior to going and begin by obtains express passes for the rides you want to go on as they go very quickly. The Star Wars ride was awesome as was Space Mountain. All staff we had dealings with were fantastic, really friendly and helpful. Most Japanese patrons dressed up in some amazing outfits and costumes or got changed into Disney t-shirts and ears once there. Staff in the gift shops will remove tags etc enabling you to wear them.Our advice would be to not go during peak times as the day we went was crazy busy enough and not peak time (that we were aware of anyway). Now we have been, not sure we would go again either in Japan or other location."
150,5,19-Sep,N/A,Tokyo Disneyland is amazing and so is the staff!,"We recently went to Disneyland in Japan and loved it. It was busy and it was raining, however, the rides and the amazing staff made it memorable. The rides were not too scary and were just good enough to have a good time. The staff always served us with a smile despite it being so busy. We are surely going back.Thanks to Disney for the lovely time!"
151,4,19-Sep,N/A,I have a great tip!,"The best advice I can give anyone who is visiting Tokyo Disneyland, is to use the ""single-rider"" option on Splash Mountain!  We walked right past the whole line of waiting people- on and on and on and on!!  -to the very front!  We were on the ride within 5 min. Saves you so much time. But we went back at 6:30pm to ride again and they were only allowing people holding fastpasses to ride. So go early enough in the day. Also, don't miss the Mickey Philharmagic- it's a bit more than just a show, with scents and wind, etc.... I'm glad we went. And the Mark Twain Riverboat is very nice at night, when you can see all the lights."
152,4,19-Sep,Australia,Lovely day out.... expect long queues!,"This is an amazing theme park, it‚Äôs huge and very very impressive and the staff are always friendly!! There are some pretty long queues for the rides, and on occasions they actually close the rides for the ‚Äústandby‚Äù people, and allow only ‚Äúfast pass‚Äù people to ride. This was pretty disappointing as the Splash Mountain ride was one we wanted to do just before going home, but it was closed to the ‚Äústandby‚Äù, from 7:00 pm to 8:30 pm!! Not good enough!The merchandise is everywhere and the patrons certainly get into the theme of Disneyland by dressing up to theme. A very pleasant day, thanks!"
153,4,19-Sep,United States,Disney but not...,"I might be biased since we grew up going to Disney World, but I didn‚Äôt get the same Disney feel here.  Tokyo Disney has an app for Japanese residents to be able to access the wait times and for fast passes.  This is a big disadvantage for foreign visitors and actually made our visit disorganized and we were not able utilize our time wisely.  Plus side, the parks are not the size as their Florida counterparts, so you are able to walk back and forth across the park quickly.  The park opens at 9am with lines forming outside the gate an hour early.  They started to allow visitors through security 15 mins before 9, and the line did move quickly.  People lined up in front of the rides and were allowed to officially enter the ride lines at 9am.  This was a little confusing since a lot of people crowded around an area that squeezed into 1 line.  I‚Äôm sorry if we cut in front of anyone, but we were just trying to go with the flow.  Wait times were usually around 40-80 mins for the big rides and 15 for the smaller rides. Splash Mountain was 90+ wait mid day, but the single rider option pushed us through within 15 mins.  We were able to ride all the rides and head back to the monorail by 8pm.  We decided to eat dinner at the mall by the train station to bypass the crazy lines at the park for restaurants.  You have to try the different flavors of popcorn and buying the collectible popcorn holder does save some $$.  It‚Äôs $25 for the holder and first flavor of popcorn.  Refills are $5 and hold 2 servings compared to paying for $4 for a single serving.  Get a Fast pass to the Pooh ride first thing in the morning.  This is the big ride of the park.  "
154,5,19-Sep,Singapore,"Nice Park with Lots of activities, fun, and enjoyment","I enjoy lots of rides in this time just before the typhoon approaching as a lot of visitors go back in the evening, a lot of performances and shows, fireworks are cancelled, a bit dissapointed, but I tried most of the rides before the park closes and enjoy tremendously when the numbers of vistors are not huge, how I wish the condition of visiting is that good even when it has no typhoon "
155,5,19-Sep,Brunei,Great park,"Went there with the wife earlier this month and had a fantastic day. Although we didn't manage to get on most of the rides (try to get there before the park open so that you can get the fast pass) , just being there was enough. The parade especially the night parade was really good. There were lots of places to eat but as a muslim there wasn't that many choices. Best to bring pre-packed food/meals. There was also lots of Disney merchandise shops all over the park so getting a souvenier wasn't that difficult. The only downside was that you weren't allowed to use a selfie stick so we either had someone to take of us or use the timer on the camera. Overall it was a wonderful and memorable trip."
156,4,19-Aug,United Kingdom,Very Cute,"Disneyland Tokyo was very cute, We went to both parks and have to say the Sea one was the better of the two. We did have to manage very long waiting times, and fast pass was a little bit of a joke. at 10am you would receive times for 9pm. If you are a Disney fan is it is worth a visit."
157,2,19-Sep,United Arab Emirates,Boring ,"‚ô° The lines were too long, waited 70 minutes for one of the rides. ‚ô° parade was cute ‚ô° kinda boring for adults"
158,5,19-Aug,N/A,Lovely place to be (with that special someone too!),"Was looking for admission tickets and got them online (from Travideals)! This location was requested to go to by my girlfriend and I must say it did not disappoint! The atmosphere was filled with laughter but was crowded. Might want to go to Tokyo Disneysea next, overall had a great time with my gal :)"
159,5,19-Sep,United States,"Disneyland, with improvements.","Tokyo Disneyland is a younger, larger sibling to Disneyland .... things are really similar, but every so often we'd get confused because it's not exactly the same layout. But the updates are usually really smart -- more space at the ""hub"", a roof over ""World Bazaar"" (basically Main Street USA), and little surprises everywhere. Don't miss the essential park food: the Little Green Men mochi trio. "
160,5,19-Sep,Australia,always a fun day out,"always a fun day out here and why would it not be it's Disneyland. it would have been a lot more fun if some of the more ""adult"" rides were open and also a little cooler day but no-one can control the weather so recommend sunscreen and a hat and drink lots of water ( except there are very few water fountains in the park which i found annoying as i water to top up my water bottle ) the park is also going under more constructions so some parts are closed off whilst this happens the parade is a normal disney parade find a cool spot sit down ( as you are forced to) and enjoy"
161,5,19-Sep,United States,They took the best parts of Disneyland and Disney World and put them into 1 park!,"This is a Castle park, so there are certain things you can expect. The usual attractions, the familiar layout, the shows, and parades. What I didn't expect is the best versions of Splash Mountain, Pirates, Jungle Cruise, and Space Mountain. The upkeep of all the rides was impressive. Not a single animatronic on any ride was out of service. The fog was where it was supposed to be. The lights had working bulbs. The sounds were on point. This has always been a little thing that takes a bit of the magic out in the states. It's depressing when you ride Splash Mountain at Disneyland and three of the animatronics sit there and don't move. Or they cant do the fire at Indiana Jones anymore, etc. The world Bazaar is cool and a cool update to Main Street USA. The castle is huge and beautiful and allows you to walk through it with some cool special effects. Overall, this will make you feel like being in the states, minus its EVEn cleaner (which the US does good with), its ran more efficiently, and the crowds are easier to deal with, even though there can be more crowds. No scooters taking up all the streets, strollers are minimal (yes we pushed ours like all of you), and the lines are orderly. If it wasn't for DisneySea, this would be my #1 park now."
162,5,19-May,Australia,Magical,What an amazing park! All the very best Disney has to offer along with amazing cast members and wonderful shows. The snack game in Tokyo is off the charts with plenty of tasty food choices. Most members speak basic English so language is not a problem. Can be extremely hot during the summer months and its not suggested to go during Golden week as crowds multiply ridiculously. Easter is especially fun with lots of cute characters and fun parades. 
163,4,19-Aug,N/A,Crowded and spend time on shopping,"We arrived at around 11am that day. It is quite crowded. Unlike HK, those princesses will invite you to take photos rather than you queue up to take photos with her. So, even you like any princess who show up in Disney, but you may not have chance to take photos with her unless u are invited on the spot.Space mountain is good and have great fun as it is much faster than the one in hk, and the whole setting is similar to the one in US florida. It is suggested u spare more time for shopping."
164,4,19-Sep,United States,"Indeed, Tokyo/ Japanese Disney land","Don‚Äôt expect someone speaks English. This is In Japan. Mickey speaks Japanese only. Even though Walt Disney is an American company, still this is in Japan. None of attraction has translation. In a way, the attraction of ‚Äúit‚Äôs a small world‚Äù uses most multiple languages (in singing) during the ride.However, the Disney magic is universal. Even though all the explanation is in Japanese, easily, we could get some gist of it. Maybe less 30% fun/ exciting than Japanese speakers though. It‚Äôd be nice to have them wear some language badge or tag so that people who may need help in a different language could rely on those symbols.Strongly wishing that they should equip multiple language tool or announcement for each attraction.  Especially, Disney sea is Japan original theme park that we cannot enjoy this anywhere else but there. But overall, Disney is Disney- simply fun and dreamy- that‚Äôs universal."
165,4,19-Aug,United States,Crowds,Was crowded like any other Disneyland.Cute! Stitch attraction was much better in Orlando ! It is something to do once in your life unless you are a huge Disney fan then you can do that everyday ! 
166,5,19-Sep,United States,A great day,"This park is very neat and clean, the park staff were all very happy to be there and were all very helpful, the attractions were in good condition. We had a fun day and will cime back another time"
167,5,19-Aug,Australia,Happiest place on earth ,If your a kid or a kid at heart its a must see. The cue jumper pass is a must. You wont have to wait 45-70 mins wait for rides. Things are quite expensive inside but you don't go to those types of places not expecting to spend money. 
168,4,19-Sep,United States,Disneyland and Disney Sea review ,"We visited both parks so I‚Äôll lump my review together. We went on a Thursday which was projected to be a very low volume day. Joke was on us because the park was as busy as Magic Kingdom is at Christmas! We arrived an hour before gates opened and were surprised to see endless lines already forming. They do not have any separate lines for guests who do not have bags so be prepared to wait regardless. When the park opened everyone ran toward Soarin (we started at Disney Sea) as that‚Äôs the newest ride at the park. We were at the FastPass ticketing booth by 9:15am and the FastPass booth was distributing return tickets for 9:10 pm! It was sold out within minutes for the day. This was not how we wanted to start our day. Luckily we were able to obtain another FastPass 2 hours after this. You can get a new FastPass every two hours in the parks but they sell out very quickly. We purchased a one day ticket to Disney Sea and a 5 pm ticket for Disneyland so we could experience both parks in one day. A park hopper ticket does not exist at Tokyo Disney so this was our work around. The costs for these two tickets is still cheaper than one day at Magic Kingdom alone.  Disneyland park is just about what you can expect for the traditional  Disney rides. It‚Äôs A Small World is the best version of the ride I have ever seen and I‚Äôve been to 4 international parks. Disney Sea‚Äòs details and themed lands are impeccable. They really left no detail out and it shows. This is nothing like what were used to in the America parks. I was seriously impressed. Food is reasonably priced which was a surprise since most reviewers say the food costs are astronomical. Quite frankly the park‚Äôs food costs are cheaper than the American parks. We paid $4.50 for a hot dog, $3 for a popsicle, $2 for a bottle of Coke. The only outrageous costs were the refillable popcorn buckets at $25 a piece with a $5 refill. Souvenirs are quite different as well. Hardly any clothing options to purchase in any of the park stores. There‚Äôs one designated park clothier in each of the parks with extremely limited selection. Most souvenirs are trinkets like headbands, landyard/ticket holders, keychains, etc. There is an extensive selection of Japanese sweets to purchase as well. All in all, glad we made the visit. This is a once in a lifetime trip. I won‚Äôt be going back simply based on the crowds. The crowds are insane so be prepared to wait in very long lines for everything. There aren‚Äôt many character meet and greets and for those that exist the lines were crazy. The food stand lines were also hectic...so just be prepared to wait for literally everything in both parks. The Mickey popsicles are by far the best frozen treat you can find. There is a Mickey hand sandwich in Toontown which is adorable. The Mickey shaped churro really exists but only found it at one cart in the back of the park at Sea. Beware - most of the churro carts around the park are not the cinnamon sugar type. We had a pizza churro. There were stands selling sweet potato churros too. The Monorail system is also more like a Japanese subway line. You need to pay $2.50 to ride the loop one time between the parks. This is worth it considering the walk between the two parks is extensive. US credit cards are accepted everywhere in the park including snack carts and drink stands. "
169,5,19-Aug,United States,Must See For Disney Fans,"This was our second experience at Tokyo Disneyland. It is a different experience than Disneyland (Anaheim) or Magic Kingdom (Orlando). We stayed for the Electrical Parade and it was great - were lucky to find good spot to watch toward back of park near Tomorrow Land. Another good thing is price - the one-day Passport is less than $80 for adults. But we did not arrive til about 4:30 and discovered a special summer program called ‚ÄúNatsu 5‚Äù where entry after 5:00 was only $44/adult. But note that August is not a good time of year for two reasons: (1) weather - very hot and humid and (2) all schools in Japan are out in August - many more people. Whenever we visit Tokyo, Tokyo Disneyland will always be on our schedule. This time we stayed at the Hilton Disney Resort so getting to Tokyo Disneyland was very easy. (The last time we were in Yokohama and the hotel had a special bus that went straight to (and from) the Park.) If you are a Disney fan, you have to go to Tokyo Disneyland!"
170,5,19-Jul,N/A,Amazing place for both adults and children!,"We purchased the 4 day pass for Disneyland and DisneySea, and it was such an awesome experience.  It was quite busy but the ride wait times were spot on and we were amazed at how clean the place was.  We literally didn't see one piece of rubbish anywhere...."
171,5,18-Dec,Vietnam,Perfect for holiday,"My family visited Disney land on the time of last Christmas 2018 (Dec 24th). What a coincidence, there was the same time with 35 years Opening of the park  anniversary. Disney land Tokyo was decorated extremely beautiful. We took a local train from my hotel (nearby Nakano station) to the park and arrived around 7:30AM. I could not believe that it is a long line-up that early. Fortunately, I booked the entrance tickets for me and my family (2 adults and 1 child, ticket price around Yen 18,000), thus, I didn't have to line up to buy it. There are many hot attractions you can participate. However, because of crowded people, you should line up first to take some fast passes which allows you save time of waiting for games. I tried to have some fried turkey legs for lunch, it costs around Y1000/pack. Its taste is nice.I would kill for going to  this park when I return Japan in the near future. That should be amazing moment."
172,5,19-Aug,United Kingdom,Fab Disney fun!,"We had a great time!Yes - it is very busy and there are long queues.Yes - it is very hot in the summer.Yes - it is an expensive day out. However, we knew all thought before we went. We've been to the Disney parks in Orlando, California and France, but this was our first Japan visit. We found the morning the busiest, with long queues. We grabbed our first Fast Pass for later in the day and then queued for a second ride. The queues did die down as the day went on and by the end of the day we had managed all the rides we wanted to go on, and some of the smaller rides too. We made use of single rider queues too. Plus we managed to watch the parades in between. It would be nice if more of the queues had some shade - same as with most theme parks really! Would just make waiting in line that much easier. We loved the range and variety of rides. It was a fabulous day out and our teenage daughter loved it so much!"
173,5,19-Aug,Malaysia,Always crowded as usual,Please follow all the strategy online if you really want to enjoy. I manage to ride 70% of all attraction even on a crowded day. It's Bon Odori holiday where is very crowded even on Wednesday. I skip all the 2hours queue and focus on fastpass on those. The rest will take 20-40 min wait. Fun but too hot at summer.
174,5,19-Aug,N/A,An amazing family experience,"The first ride we went on at Disneyland was a little kids ride called Snow White. On the ride, I turned to my teenage child and said, this little kids ride is ten times better than any ride for any age group that I've been on in any Australian theme park. Then of course the rides just got better and better. It really was an amazing place. My favourite rides were: It's a small world after-all, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Peter Pan's flight. My teenager's favourite ride was: Space Mountain. The street parade was really fabulous! If you ever go to Tokyo please do go visit Tokyo Disneyland. I couldn't pay entry fee with my Australian credit card (so take cash for entry fee if your an Aussie). However, I was able to use my credit card within the park for purchases. Disneyland was one of the highlights of our trip to Tokyo."
175,3,19-Aug,United Kingdom,Ticked off the list,"My daughter has been desperate to visit Disneyland so during a 3 week trip to Japan we slotted a 2 night stay in!We got there early and had paid for fast pass, which were a waste of time and money! 2 big rides not open so the queues were massive and it was incredibly hot! The food is dreadful, seriously awful fast food churned out, also surprisingly all the drinks stations didn‚Äôt sell bottles of water only in Wild West section......just fizzy sugary drinks ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èWe lasted 7 hours! Probably queued for at least 4.5 of that time!It‚Äôs ticket off the list we did enjoy it as we had mentally prepared for it being busy and just went with the flow.Though not very magical."
176,1,19-Aug,United Kingdom,There is no q in Disney- oh yes there is,"Love Disney and Universal in Florida and Disney have replicated a large amount of Magic Kingdom here.However whilst my visit was on holiday week in Tokyo our app was showing D on crowd rating so can get a lot worse.Disney have built 2 parks in Tokyo but the population of the area is around 36 million so demand is massive.Lines at rides are way too long and have apparently reached 4 hours..We managed 2 fast passes but then they ran out.It was 30 minutes soon after opening for Star Tours and that soon went to over an Hour.Waited then about 45 minutes for Pirates of Caribbean.Next Haunted Mansion, over an hour.Buzz Lightyear was 90 minutes.It was August and unlike Florida which is hot all year round, we lined up for a large part of the time in direct scorching heat.if you want a drink then that was about 15 deep at a cart.When we went for lunch all tables were taken and people were sat on floor.Disney obviously don‚Äôt care and will let in as many as they can to keep the tills ringing.However if you pay a lot to get in and spend most of your time in lines for a short ride then it‚Äôs simply no fun.They need to rethink and control the numbers.I certainly wouldn‚Äôt return"
177,3,19-Aug,N/A,A whole day of rides (and queues),"Long walk to the ticket counter and then to the entrance. Adult day pass is ¬•7400. Long queues for the popular rides. Free water dispensers available only at a few places. Another option is to buy water bottles at ¬•200. Upon exiting, let the staff stamp your hand if you wish to reenter. Present the handstamp and ticket when reentering. During this period the cheaper alternative after-6pm pass is not available. "
178,4,19-Aug,Australia,Fun even if you're not there for the rides,"Went here for my wife's birthday. As she is physically unwell, we had to skip most of the big rides, but still had a great time. For a theme park, concession prices are pretty good."
179,4,19-Aug,United Kingdom,Very very expensive but very good,"We went on a Wednesday in mid August. It was very very hot and out clothes were soaked through after an hour.We took water bottles with us and filled them multiple times at the water fountains.We arrived at 10:20. Went straight to the Star Wars ride and got a fast pass. Did the ride immediately and then got a Space Mountain fast pass at 11:10. Out Space Mountain reservation was for 19:00-20:00. After that, we could not get anymore fast passes. So, beware, book your fast passes early.We stayed until 10pm and had several rides between 8 and 10pm.Quite a few rides were shut - for example, Splash Mountain and Mark Twain. We were a little disappointed with the selection of t-shirts- the colours were so incredibly garish and there were very few with ‚ÄòTokyo Disney‚Äô on them. All 4 of us in our party wanted to buy t-shirts but only 2 did.Overall we had a very enjoyable and memorable day. "
180,5,19-May,India,What a place !,"This is one of the top attractions in tokyo, esp for families with young kids. We have been to other disneylands in US and Paris and this is much bigger than Paris and Hongkong one. This is also very crowded but that may just be because we visited during Japan golden week. We had taken express pass also but in disnely land how this works is that you can pre book the rides. It was so crowded that they finished on the slots even.We could not do more than 10 rides but the whole environment was amazing. I would suggest to go during little off hours if you can. Food also should not be an issue much but veg options are little less."
181,4,18-Dec,Singapore,Magical Disneyland Always,"Been to various Disneyland & back in Tokyo one for third time, it never fails to take my breathe away. It always brings out the kid in us. Though language is a barrier but still instructions to the rides are the same. The place is super clean. Food and drinks are not too cheap so it's a place where i spent abit more but it bought me nice experience also. With young kids (that includes me though entrance tix i paid adult fare) hehehe.. Disneyland in my opinion is much more worth it."
182,3,19-Aug,N/A,Should be called Disneyline ,I‚Äôve visited Disneyland Paris twice and LA once and was excited to visit Tokyo Disney unfortunately I can‚Äôt say I enjoyed this place as much as the others.Not sure why they invented FastPass but it‚Äôs ruined the entire experience. I much preferred the old way were everyone waited in line together. I feel the FastPass has made the queues longer then they needed to be.Apart from that quite a few rides seemed to be down for maintenance.The Zootopia show was good and when they say you will get wet they aren‚Äôt joking.The light spectacular parade was a good way to end the evening.If visiting in August bring plenty of water and stay cool. Not much shade and saw plenty of people fainting from the heat.
183,5,18-Sep,United States,A place you have to visit in Tokyo,"I know we have Disneyland in California and Disney World in Florida, but there‚Äôs something even more magical about visiting Disneyland in Tokyo. The public transportation in Tokyo is phenomenal and can get you anywhere really quick, and it just so happens to get you right in front of Disneyland. The prices blew my mind since they are so expensive here, but we paid only about $60 per person for a 1-day 1-park pass. All of the signs and maps are in English (and Japanese) which made it convenient - but I still had my Google translator ready. Similar rides in Tokyo as we do at Disneyland, but most are in Japanese, which made it even more fun personally. The walkways are huge and spread out very nicely and it was never too crowded anywhere we went. The food selection was perfect for those who like adventure, otherwise they did have hotdogs closer to the entrance. All of the people in the park (cast members and guests) were incredibly nice and helpful. The park was spotless and there was a spot in ‚ÄúWesternland‚Äù (our Adventureland) that you could buy some real cowboy attire. We went during the summer so it was humid since it is right near the ocean and it had been raining that morning. Make sure you wear something breathable and make sure you have a rain coat handy because it does tend to rain frequently in Tokyo. The lines weren‚Äôt awful for some of the rides, but others had hour+ long lines but that wasn‚Äôt anything new since Disneyland in California is the same. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely go back anytime!"
184,3,19-Aug,Malaysia,Lovely,"Took my kids to Tokyo Disneyland for the summer holidays, we went for the evening session because the tickets for the whole day and from 3pm was a bit too expensive and because it was just too hot during the day.We could not do much apart from walk around because everywhere we went, the queue was just too long, nevertheless the kinds saw the parade which was iindeed beautiful, with lots of lights and Disney characters on parade."
185,4,19-Aug,Thailand,A Day in Wonderland,"I recommend 2 days time to fully absorb the huge choice of rides at Tokyo Disneyland. Winnie the Pooh is a must see, Space Mountain and Pirates of the Caribbean are also highly recommended. All of these rides could be pre-booked through the Fast Track vendor machine option located on either site of the ride entrance."
186,4,19-May,N/A,Great Experience!!!,"I decided last minute to visit Disneyland and Disney Sea. It was a great experience, one of my favorite attractions being Space Mountain. It was definitely the fastest and most thrilling ride in the park. Food and Drinks are very reasonably priced inside the park.  Souvenirs and gift shops were pricey. I was able to buy tickets the day before from the local 7 Eleven, even though they weren't available online. They were also cheaper than buying from the website but this only covered admission and you will need to use the website if you want and package deals."
187,5,19-Mar,Singapore,Awesome day of fun with friends!,"Was super excited to go to Disneyland in Tokyo with my friends, since it was first time being in Japan as well and it was worth every minute of our time there! I was super lucky and glad to to have found some tickets that can be bought online (from Travi Deals) too with some promo!Bought the tickets for my friends as well to get ready for rides there!Love the rides, love the gift shops, love it all!Next stop: Tokyo Disneysea!"
188,5,19-Apr,India,Its a wonderland,"It was totally awesome for us. Different themes/rides/activities, etc. It is not only for kids, adults can enjoy too. If you are having JR pass, you can easily reach to this spot as its covered.Buy the tickets well in advance through online portal to avoid queues. Food is costly but we dont have other choice here. Enjoy your day :-)"
189,4,19-Jul,Malaysia,Still magical,"Still magical despite being opened since 1983.  It was the first Disney park to be built outside the United States. There are seven themed lands. We loved Toon town where we got to meet our favorite Disney characters , Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.  We also saw the parades and the shows. As it is summer now, there was this special event, ‚ÄúDonald‚Äôs Hot Jungle Summer‚Äô, exciting and thrilling. There are many restaurants to have meals and also many shops to search for Disneyland souvenirs. Before we left, we took many photos with the Disney castle - so majestic , gigantic and magical."
190,5,19-Aug,Indonesia,"Great Disneyland but hot, hot, hot!","Being big fans of Disney, our family has been working our way across the globe ticking off our bucket list of visiting every Disney park on the planet.  I‚Äôd heard stories that the Disneyland in Tokyo was very crowded and we wouldn‚Äôt get many rides however that turned out not to be the case.  We turned up about 9am which is quite late for the Japanese who tend to get there on opening but even then we ticked off Pirates of the Caribbean and Jungle Cruise in the first half hour.  Both had wait times of 5-10 minutes.  It started getting more crowded as the day wore on but not as crazy as Disneyland in Anaheim which we visited last year.  As per my title it gets real hot real quick and we were really sweating by mid morning.  We are staying at Disneyland hotel next door which made it real convenient to nip back to the hotel mid afternoon for a break before re-entering park in early evening.  I‚Äôd recommend this as trying to tackle it all in a day would be possible but would be draining.  Also book a couple of table service restaurants well in advance giving you the chance to sit down in the AC."
191,5,19-Jul,N/A,Pricey but worth every penny ,"The park is well-managed in terms of queue and cleanliness. like all theme parks, there‚Äôs bound to always be a crowd but you don‚Äôt really feel it there because it‚Äôs so organised. the food is good too! we thoroughly enjoyed our time here. "
192,5,19-Jul,United States,Visit if you love Disney,"We have visited Disneyland and Disney World in the USA and enjoyed seeing the differences at Tokyo Disneyland.  The prices for food was much lower than in the US parks.  The merchandise is mostly geared towards characters.  We wanted shirts, mugs, etc with ""Tokyo Disneyland"" on them, but could only find one shirt. That was a bit disappointing, but they did have some different wearable ears.  The Main Street is covered, so that was nice. "
193,5,19-Jul,United States,Entrance Under Construction but more then Magic Kingdom in Florida,"This has all the rides it seems from Peter Pan, Whinny the Pooh (much better then Florida), Monsters,Inc. and too many to list. Its a great park. The electric parade (similar to the 1970's florida parade is the best I have ever seen in any Disney Park. The water Show at the castle willl cool you off is you stand in the front areas. Fun Fun Fun. "
194,2,19-Jul,Australia,Mickey suck money,"Japan Disneyland Disneyland Disneyland Well , where shall I start ?  Let see .Before anyone ever visit this so called magical place , is like almost every single person child hood that need to fulfill in some point of our life .This so called theme park isn‚Äôt really a theme park but rather more of a pay money to enjoy been tortured . ( if you like been tortured by using money , this will be your best solution ) The entrance fee isn‚Äôt the only fee that you be paying . There is other plus plus involved inside it . ( leeching more money off you ) Almost each so called theme that you going in , you need to wait at least 45min ( none peak season ) and it nothing you can play , rather more like a sight seeing or watching old Disney cartoon . Don‚Äôt see much Disney character walking around the theme park ( maybe cause that moment I am there , is raining )No firework during summer  No special season ticket after 3pm ! ( I think this special ticket only for winter season ) Even the most iconic character of all time is hiding inside his house aka Mickey house , just to leech you more money ( to take photo with Mickey , you need to pay him royalty fee  ) or you can only have 1 photo using your camera . ( how bad is that ? , I came all the way from another country because of you Mickey , and you wan more money just to have photo with you !!! That a pathetic move from Disney ! ( thanks Disney but no thanks ) Some theme isn‚Äôt even available and we still get charge full price for our entrance . ( I am not a stingy person but this type of greedy business system is what put people off ) . Anyhow , my conclusion for this , do it once and don‚Äôt do it anymore , not worth the time waiting for each theme just for sightseeing . ( there are plenty more of other way to make you feel better ) BUT on the other hand , you still need to fulfill your childhood  üòÇForgot to mention - don‚Äôt listen to those blogger online ( their opinion sometimes doesn‚Äôt match the idealist of yours )"
195,5,19-Apr,Australia,It really is the happiest place on earth!,"We visited with a group of 8 people aged from 8 to 70 and we all had a fabulous time. We were there on a Tuesday in April and there were only a few things that had excessive long wait times - mainly the roller coasters and more popular rides. With no interest in roller coasters, we were able to go on most of our choices without waiting more than around 10 minutes. The special event Easter parade was excellent. We had lunch at Tomorrowland Terrace, which offers a good range of fast food options including fries, Mickey shaped chicken nuggets and Mickey shaped burgers. We also had a delicious peach cake which came with a limited edition Disney Easter souvenir plate. We had dinner at the Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall which is a counter-service buffeteria-style restaurant. We lined up for around 30 minutes but the food was excellent and worth the wait. The unbirthday cake was particularly delicious and easily served 4 to 6 people. Unfortunately the fireworks were cancelled the night we were there due to unsatisfactory weather conditions, which was disappointing."
196,5,19-Jul,N/A,Be young and happy,"It was a great happy place in-spite of  the heat... rides are great shows are nice even if almost everything is in Japanese , you will enjoy watching ."
197,5,19-Jul,N/A,Disneyland,Really fun place great for kids - stayed at the amazing Sheraton Tokyo bay. Very clean and well maintained theme park.
198,5,19-May,Australia,Dream come true,"I wanted to visit Disneyland since i was a child. Dream finally came true, and it did not disappoint. I wish there were more luxury choices for lunch though. I will take my children here certainly."
199,5,19-Jul,Australia,Fabulous,"I love Disneylands and this was my fifth.  They're all similarly laid out so if you know your Disney, you won't have a problem finding your way around.  It was lesser populous than Disney Sea but I think it a much better park.  Vast, so good walking shoes are necessary but much to see in between walking and/or queueing for rides.  Any Disneyland is a must and this one is no exception.  There was no language barrier with those staff who don't speak English carrying a phrase book to help with communication."
200,4,19-Jul,Germany,Almost perfect,"The three of us went during the first week of July and had a wonderful time. We went on weekdays but it was still crowded. It was also rainy but that didn't keep people away. There were still lines for the more popular rides but the fast pass system helps to eleviate this so that you're not queuing all day. There are more things to do in the park than just the rides, anyway. It's a very clean park and the cast members are lovely and helpful. Most speak some English although it was difficult sometimes when you are asking about something specific. But they have created a Disneyland that has many of the same atmospheres of the original in California. It is not as big but it is expanding.The parades are great. Be sure to secure a spot 45 minutes beforehand. People sit on mats and are very orderly for the most part. Cast members constantly come around to make sure everything is orderly and no one is breaking the rules. No hats, strollers must be folded, and you cannot stand in front of people. No kids on shoulders, either. The food and merchandise are varied and not too pricey, especially compared to other parks. The green man mochi and flavoured popcorn are must tries. The main criticism I have is character greetings. If you have a little girl who dreams of meeting Disney princesses, and that is the main reason you are coming, then there is a good chance that you will leave heartbroken and your little girl will be in tears. You have to be very very lucky. First of all, not all the princesses are here. Snow White, Cinderella, Belle and Rapunzel are the only ones you can meet (Ariel and Jasmine are at Disneysea). During a normal day, they are only available for meet and greets for a total of 15 minutes. After asking around we were finally able to find out where they would be. Once seen, a mob of 20-somethings will circle them, hoping to get chosen (there are no lines for this) by the princess, no doubt for their instagram pages. Luckily the princesses know this, and mostly choose children (dress your girls up in princess outfits to heighten your chances). My young girl (she's 5) was chosen by Rapunzel and Belle for photos (both princesses were very kind to my daughter). By the time we ran over to Snow White, it was all over. She gave my daughter a hug while I took a few fast photos, but that was it. 15 minutes and they are rushing back to get ready for the next parade. My daughter was very very lucky - most are not and I saw numerous people in tears. I don't know why Disneyland lets this happen. At Disneysea, Ariel is in her grotto all day, available for photos. Likewise, in Anaheim, princesses are available in the Fantasy Faire Royal Hall all day, and many of them are wandering around, available for meet and greets. This is the only big flaw in this park. Otherwise, it's a great place!"
201,5,19-Jul,United States,Fun park and outstanding service,It is mostly like the other Disney parks.  Make sure to ride the Pooh ride (different than Anaheim).  Try the different flavors of popcorn also.  Service inside the park is outstanding - combination of Disney and Japanese hospitality.  Get there when it opens and ride the popular rides.  The park gets crowded after about 2 hours until closing.
202,3,19-Mar,N/A,Not as much of a fairytale as hoped,"I hadn‚Äôt been to Disneyland before so was really looking forward to experiencing my first trip to one. We went on a weekday as advised as it‚Äôs meant to be quiet and it was horrendously busy felt like there were far too many people in the park, even to get a drink from a vending machine you were looking at 12 people in a queue throughout the day. The fast track pass was a joke as most of them had sold out extremely early. We managed to get one which was the buzz light year ride. We queued for 90 mins for the Winnie the Pooh ride which was over in 90 seconds and felt like a waste of time. The whole day there we managed 4 rides.Then the parades the daylight one we were told to sit down and i couldn‚Äôt see a thing and then for the night time display found a good spot to stand and was told to move on by a staff member only to be told by another staff member to go back and pretty much advised to stand where view was blocked by bushes - poor organising. The fireworks were amazing at the end and the graphics on the castle, some of the souvenirs were nice and the food although overpriced was tasty.Did feel we wasted a day of our two week trip to Japan where we could have done something more fulfilling instead of constant queuing all the time, it has put me off going to any other Disneylands."
203,4,18-Dec,Singapore,Astronomically expensive & super long queue,"The whole world says to come on a weekday as it will be less crowded. Says who? it was super crowded. Lots & lots of people had already queued long before the gates opened. I saw many had brought their own picnic mats. But hey! It is winter & that thin flimsy piece of cloth is not going to keep your butt warm. Bring a portable stool please. Speaking of long queue, the waiting time to see Mickey Mouse was a staggering 90 minutes! Heck, I did not do it. Spend 90 minutes just to have a few photos taken with MM which will probably take less than 30 seconds?Souvenirs were super expensive. A packet of soft candies cost 1,200 yen. Gulp! A rice ladle cost $16 SGD & a MM hair band costs SGD $20! (I cannot remember the exact yen). I was constantly converting yen to SGD on my hand phone, gasping at just how expensive everything was. If TDL kept increasing the price of admission tickets to boost its coffers, I would not be surprised if they did the same to its souvenirs.Food wise, there was a rather limited selection no matter which restaurant you went to. And yes, all were expensive & taste lacklustre. I bought light refreshment from Daiei Supermarket to consume while queuing for the ride as apparently, eating while waiting as allowed, & I overheard a Japanese mother comment to her husband ""When are they going to stop eating?"" All right. So did she think I do not understand Japanese? I could have retaliate back but I decided to pretend I did not understand anything as I did not want to get angry & spoil my holiday mood."
204,4,19-Jul,Australia,Wonderful Disneyland,"Tokyo Disney is spacious and follows the Disneyland formula but with - dare I say it - a much better castle than Anaheim.  Many rides are the same as Anaheim but be aware - Space Mountain: anyone over 6 foot will struggle to ride this = tiny!!!The staff are super friendly and you‚Äôll have a great day.  Shopping and food choices are not as good as Anaheim, but still a lovely day out.  Easily accessed via Mahaima Railway Station."
205,5,19-Jun,United States,Great break from normal touring while in Japan,"Enjoyed both parks. Many things are different than you get in the US.  They do not have park hoppers for one day visitors unless you stay in their hotel (or do a 3 day pass) so we spent the day at Disney Sea and then after 6pm, bought the evening pass for Disney Tokyo for $40 each to enjoy that park until closing at 10."
206,5,19-Jul,United States,Awesome Restaurants ,"Definitely love Disney Tokyo , We bought tickets a week in advance we were in line at 8am park opens 9am did 4 rides by 11am. I recommend eating early lunch to avoid crowds in the restaurants. Queen of Hearts by its a small world has great food. No wait at 11am. "
207,4,19-Jul,China,A little bit of Magic,"Disneyland Tokyo is good as it is spacious and the staff is very courteous and friendly despite the lack of English. Most of the rides are for younger kids and the same as the other Disneyland around the world (most rides also in HK), but it is still a good visit for first time park goers. I prefer Disney Sea more as the park is bigger and has more thrill rides and performance. The few shows and rides worth seeing/ riding in Disneyland Tokyo are: Star Tours, Space Mountain, Stitch Encounter, Buzz Lightyear, and Mickey‚Äôs PhilharMagic.Overall, more a park for kids or families rather than adults. More on DisneySea on another review. "
208,4,19-Apr,United Kingdom,Go early!,"We left getting our tickets quite late and we were visiting when it was the extended bank holiday so I'd say but them in plenty of time and buy them online. We saw people queuing to buy tickets and you risk not even getting in the park. I'm not sure how busy this Disneyland is usually but I would recommend getting here for when it opens and getting a fast pass for space mountain. We did this and found we were able to get on another ride before our fast pass time. The fast passes sell out really quickly so it's worth it to get here early. Food wise, the Mickey waffle from The Great American Waffle Company in World Bazaar and Mickey glove sandwich (we got ours at Plazma Ray's diner in Tomorrowland) are absolute musts. Both were delicious. There's a good variety of foods and snacks to try in Tokyo. "
209,5,19-Jun,Iran,a day is not enough to see,"a day is not enough to see,very beautiful place Ÿà Very attractive and spectacular, and my daughter enjoyed the games.A great place for the whole day with the family or single .after games there is a shop related to the game like hat,shirts and...,there are restaurant and fast food,there is street performance show durig a day.most of the game designed by robot and computer effects and seems very real and can see Cartoon characters every where.you can find water for drink in this area free from the tap water , I can not forget it.you can reach here by train ,the station is about 10min a way. its open from 10am to 10:pm and the price was 7500 yen for adult include all games.do not miss it."
210,3,19-Jul,N/A,Limited amount of character experiences,"Disneyland is always something to experience, a childhood delight. Unfortunately, there are VERY little opportunities for you to see the characters up close. Definitely not like in the promo. The Disney princesses are mostly in the parade only and a few of mickey‚Äôs entourage roam the park for a small amount of time. If you‚Äôre expecting characters to be everywhere they won‚Äôt. (This is my third time with the same experience, years apart)"
211,4,19-Jun,United States,Wonderful Day!,"On a two week trip to Japan, my husband and I decided to hit Tokyo Disney for two days...being the Disney fans we are. We booked a two day Passport ticket and visited Tokyo Disneyland first. The park was very similar to WDW, just smaller and about half the attractions.  They are also missing the immaculate and lush landscaping of WDW but I think that is due to the difference in climate. The park is clean and the staff are both warm and amazing, even with the language barrier.  We left not feeling the magic of Disney we are used to but were excited to go to the Disneysea Park on our second day. It did not disappoint!!!! Disneysea is 200% magical, opulent with extremely detailed and wonderful lands to discover!! Similar in size and feel of Epcot. We could have spent two full days there, maybe three!  One thing about Japan Disney is their love and affection for Duffy the Bear. He is the bear Mickey gave Minnie, and if you‚Äôre a fan of Duffy, this is your spot as he has his own stores with tons of adorable merchandise! Our favorite attractions were by far: Indiana Jones, Journey to the Center of Earth and Tower of Terror but all of the rides were delightful and exciting. Try all of the popcorn flavors and make sure to get the shrimp donut/pasty food item which is near the American coastline area. Delish!!Disneysea was extremely busy and the wait times were longer than Disneyland as it‚Äôs the more superior park. All in all we loved Tokyo Disney parks and had a wonderful time!!"
212,5,19-Jul,Australia,lots of variety - BUT...,"*** remember to print out your tickets!! ***you are issued electronic PDF tickets and like 99% of theme parks i‚Äôve been all over the world, you can use the bar or QR code on the PDF in your phone. but for some reason, the staff insists on using a printout which is archaic to the point of insanity. i showed the turnstile girl that the turnstile will accept the QR code displayed from my phone but she insisted i use paper tickets which meant on the first day i had to walk all the way to an office tucked in a small corner with one very slow computer to print out the tickets. i don‚Äôt get why the QR code has to be shown on a printed ticket as opposed to the phone and don‚Äôt give me an excuse one or the other is easier to falsify because they both can be falsified if one wants to try. totally unreasonable. if you lived in a hotel apartment like i did with no access to a printer, you will be slightly screwed. otherwise... the theme park was awesome!"
213,5,19-Jul,Saudi Arabia,Memorable Moments with Family ,We went here early morning around 9 am from Hilton Tokyo bay free bus to bay station they you have the monorail to Disney land we stop to buy tickets for the monorail for 2 days at station while the tickets of Disney land for 2 days (2adult+3kids+free for kid below 4years)= to 55200 yenThe entrance was so nice and smooth and the waiting time was 20 minutes then after noon increased to 50 minutes but still my kids have chance to play most of big games They have many cafe and restaurants but we decided to have our dinner at the hotel while it served for free and we have nice ice cream and curry popcorn was tasty and delicious We spent amazing time and my daughters visited the castle and set of the princess chair and have unforgettable moments The shows was very crowded and exciting 
214,1,19-Jul,United Kingdom,Bad experience on Big Thunder Mountain...,"This year Tokyo Disneyland celebrates 35 years since it opened. I was one of their first visitors and have visited it many, many times during those 35 years. July 5th I visited again with my family for a long deserved day out. Most of the day was very enjoyable, until we went to Big Thunder Mountain at 9:45 pm. Four members of my family had Fast Passes, I did not, but I obtained a ‚ÄúSingle Rider‚Äù pass so that we could all get in together. However, just as we were about to board a very unsympathetic and rude Attendant, a girl, refused to let me board with my family and separated us. I was forced to stand and wait with another ‚ÄúSingle Rider,‚Äù who was Japanese. I felt I was being punished for a misdemeanour and was not treated according to the usual Japanese ‚ÄúThe Customer is Number 1‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Customer is God‚Äù philosophy. I was bitterly hurt and disappointed, then faced being forced to wait until my family disappeared on the Ride and I was still waiting to board. I asked another Attendant. Another train came and went before I approached the second Attendant. She asked me to go to the back of the next train and join another customer. I decided that the fun had been taken away from me and indeed the entire day was ruined for me and my family because of this horrible experience. I asked to be shown the exit because I no longer wanted to go on the Ride. Both inside and outside I complained to other Staff and one of them walked behind my daughter and I and constantly apologised. I told him it was really too late and I was very hurt.  The first Attendant was the most cold hearted person I have ever met in Tokyo Disneyland, and if she treats other customers like she treated me, a 70 year old, then she really should not be working there. I hope that other customers do not experience the cold hearted rudeness I was subjected to. I intend contacting Customer Services, which seems inaccessible, to further complain. By the way, I‚Äôm a fluent Japanese speaker, and all my communications with the Staff were in Japanese."
215,3,19-Jun,Australia,Very crowded,"I am a Disney girl. I have been to many different parks all around the world but something is going wrong. The park is incredibly clean, the staff are wonderful and the rides and attractions are just like the original park in LA. There is magic here BUT it is so incredibly packed that the magic turns to grumpiness because you have to line up for everything. It's ok if you wait for 30 mins.....but over 90 mins for a 2 minute ride is stretching the enjoyment level. Fast Passes and increased crowd volume are ruining the parks. There are just not enough attractions or rides for the volume of people. When you live in the same state/country as a Disney park you have the opportunity to buy an annual pass, so if you go on a busy day and only see 1 or 2 things, it's ok...you can come back. When you pay heaps of money to.fly your family to a Disney, pay for passes and accommodation, it is a major disappointment to stand in line for hours. When I look at the statue of Walt Disney at the park, I wonder if this was the vision he had in mind? "
216,5,19-Jul,N/A,Magical Adventure,"If you want a magical adventure - this is the place to be. The attractions are inch-perfect with smart solutions for the queuesystem(use the fastpass if possible). Everyone was so friendly and in character and it was so nice seeing people dressing the same as friends, family, couple etc - gave it a more Disneyfeeling. Their stores are amazingly good also."
217,5,19-Jun,N/A,Happiest place on earth times 2,"First day we went to Disney Sea and the second day to Disneyland.  Although it rained pretty much the entire day it was still a great experience! Loved the different sections, seeing the castle was awesome too. We had missed the fireworks show so we went back the day after to watch it. They have afternoon tickets you can get for about 5400 yen. Next time we go I'm buying more snacks to bring home!"
218,5,19-Jul,N/A,Two days at Tokyo Disneyland ,Awesome few days at Tokyo Disneyland. The queues can get long so make the most of the fast pass system. Most the day time and night time parades were amazing but the night time fireworks were lack luster but still good.
219,5,18-Oct,Australia,What an amazing place,"This was my second visit to a Disney park, and much like Euro Disney it did not disappoint. I was expecting massive crowds and long lines, but that was not the case, no more then any other Disney park in any case. Clean and tidy with reasonably priced food etc. Well worth a visit, and if you are going then you need to visit Tokyo Disney Sea as well !!!"
220,4,19-Jun,Australia,Not too bad,The park was as expected from other Disneyland‚Äôs. Not as many opportunities for character photos and the merchandise did not have a large range. Absolutely wonderful staff though who are so friendly and helpful!
221,5,19-Jun,United Kingdom,Fantastic day and night with my wife ,"My wife and I spent a fantastic day and night in Disneyland and found it so good staff were very helpful,lots of places to eat,drink and after paying for a day pass all the rides were free,but be ready to queue,very large crowds but don‚Äôt let that put you off,we spent over 10 hours there and could have stayed more,enjoy."
222,3,19-Jun,United Kingdom,Good enough,Not the best Disney around half the rides were closed for maintenance including splash mountain. If you do go go early! Big rush for space mountain and big queues form at the gates. If you‚Äôre English speaking avoid the shows as they‚Äôre in Japanese and it‚Äôll be a waste of your time
223,5,19-Jun,France,Super park,"Wonderful parc and amazing moments spent.We went with our child, she was so amazed... ans happy.We stayed 1 full day... it s free form kids below 3y.1 day was enough for us... we could enjoyed a lot of attractions and the queue line was not very long. Once again we went during a week day, with no holiday.Last thing important, try to get tickets on line, 7 days before or buy tickets into the Disney store. Better..."
224,3,19-Jun,United Kingdom,Good - but extremely busy,"This will be my 4th Disneyland Park I have visited. All-in-all it was a good experience, the magic of Disney is everywhere. However it is much, much busier than other ‚Äòwestern‚Äô parks. Queue times will be almost 2 hours within minutes if the park opening. Fast Passes are therefore key if you plan to do anything more than a. Few rides. This park is obviously primarily aimed at children. The rides are largely based around the children‚Äôs films. For a more adult experience with larger rides you should consider visiting DisneySea just across the bay. "
225,5,19-Apr,Philippines,Theme Park hype!,Overwhelmed by the huge number of parkgoers during park entrance at around 8:30am. Fast Pass is the key! 
226,4,19-Jun,N/A,Alternate Reality,"Before coming to Tokyo Disneyland we had only been to the parks in Florida before. Being at TDR was like being in an alternate reality. There were so many things that were the same, but had slightly different twists. Overall, we found the rides to be less thrilling than at Magic Kingdom. The snacks are really fun to try and the merch is amazing compared to in the states! Our favorite rides were Pooh's Hunny Hunt and Monsters Inc. We spent two full days at the park and my favorite thing by far was the Dreamlights parade. We staked out a spot way before it started on a bench, but it didn't matter much since everyone sits in Japan (which is so much better). The parade is absolutely amazing! We weren't able to watch fireworks while we were there because they were cancelled every night (I think because of wind). We had a really fun time and can't wait for the new lands to open up!"
227,4,19-Jun,United States,Disney Tokyo,"There are many similarities to US Disney theme parks with enough differences to make it an adventure. Staff very Friendly and kind. Ride lines as you expect in summer but not overwhelming long. Not as many cast members who speak English as I expected but enough who do , picture menus and signs to allow low frustration level. Plenty of shopping in park. Popcorn containers are a novelty item in a variety of themes. Wish I had room to bring some home"
228,5,19-Jun,India,Indian Family visit to japan,If going to Disney please buy express pass if u want to do everything otherwise u r bound to miss out few things 
229,5,19-Jun,United States,One of the best,"One of the best Disney Parks in the world.  Wait times are no joke (Pooh's Hunny Hunt fastpasses are gone 90 minutes after park opening).  Get there at least 30 minutes before park opening (preferably 45-60 minutes).For Happy 15 entry, they let you in 30 minutes before, so make sure you are there 30 minutes before that."
230,5,19-Jun,United States,Great experience,"I was visiting with a group of 30 high school students from the US, some who had and had never been to the park at home. I really enjoyed the experience overall as did the students. The entrance price was about $30 less than it is in the US and the park still uses ‚Äúfast passes‚Äù to allow visitors to cut the lines a few times during their visit. Space Mountain and Thunder Mountain were the two rides with the longest lines. Splash Mountain was closed for renovations. All other rides had 45 minute predicted wait times or less. The least we saw was 20 minutes for Pirates of the Caribbean. Meal prices also weren‚Äôt bad. I had a large chicken curry and a large oolong tea for about $12 US and I purchased two bottled beverages for 200 yen each. At first I had trouble finding souvenirs that were actually connected to Japan but later found small stuffed animals of Mickey, Minnie and friends in Kimonos for about $22 US. There were also bento lunch boxes, chopsticks, towels, assorted Japanese snacks in tins and other things related to Japan. The light show was really nice though the fireworks were cancelled due to high winds. The park did make several announcements in Japanese and English alerting the crowd to the cancellation. Overall a great experience! "
231,3,19-Apr,United Kingdom,Big disappointment (sorry Disney ),"We arrived in Yokohama and got a train to Disney to buy tickets for the following day. The lovely guy in the ticket office was great his name was Shimozawa.He was helpful and friendly.The following day we arrived excited to be here from England, but soon found out that it was so different to Other Disney‚Äôs we have been too.The parade was over in a flash only around 6 floats and not worth the hours spent waiting for it.All the Japanese people were singing with the catchy song they were singing which was lovely although we could understand a word of it.To visitors from other countries a lot of Disney is spoken in Japanese which we were expecting bit not quite the same when given headsets to listen too.We only saw one character all day and when we went near were waved away.I‚Äôm disabled too.. I walk with a calliper and stick and like to stay out of my wheelchair when I can, but only one person, a young man who when we went to ride on the train showed me the lift and aloud me priority which was fantastic. The only person all day to do this. ( big thank you )Haunted mansion, Pirates of the Caribbean I had to stand and wait although it was plain to see this was difficult for me and due to that we had to sit out the rest of the afternoon as this was just to much for me.Love you Disney but here in Japan you didn‚Äôt care or look after me, and I can only tell as I found it.Disney Florida next year .. here we come."
232,4,18-Oct,Cambodia,Waiting time is crazy!,"Had a reeeallyy fun time but each ride has about a 40-50min waiting time, which pretty much takes up the whole day (even with the fastpasses). The best ones were The Haunted Mansion and Space Mountain! (Had really wanted to try Pooh‚Äôs Hunny Hunt and Monsters Inc but the queues were ridiculous and there simply weren‚Äôt enough time). If you only had a few days to spare in Tokyo and you‚Äôre not as patient as the typical Japanese, best visit someplace else! "
233,5,19-Jun,Australia,Officially converted my husband ,"So, my husband had zero interest in coming to Disneyland but did it for me and I can officially say, we will both be back. Having been to Disney in California I was a bit unsure as to whether I would like it but I absolutely loved it and maybe slightly better than California . California is prettier but the people here are so happy and lovely . We made a beeline for the Winnie the Pooh ride and my hubby loved it and wanted to go straight back on . We then went and got a fast pass for the monsters inc ride which was also good. We were lucky the lines were not long today and got in quite a few rides. The shopping was fantastic . Please , I must suggest you all have the soy and butter flavoured popcorn along with the curry flavour. Yes, it sounds gross but they are both amazinggg. My husband and I are both already planning our next trip. Can‚Äôt wait to come back again "
234,4,18-Dec,Singapore,Magical as expected,"We bought the bus tickets from Shinjuku bus station. The bus was very comfortable. Remember to be on time. We got the entrance tickets from Klook. Picking up the tickets were easy. Just pop by the Maihama station. Walk to the back of the station where the carparks are. There was a lady there with a basket on a stool. No signages though.Going back was pretty convenient though although you need to be sure where you would like to alight. Go there a little earlier as the queue can be quite long, especially when it is closing time.We've been to Hong Kong, Shanghai Disneyland previously. It looked pretty much the same although the Shanghai Disneyland seem bigger. We just love that same magical feel whenever you walk into Disneyland. The rides were abit too kiddish for my teenage son though."
235,5,18-Jul,N/A,"""One day is not enough""",I love rollercoasters! Tokyo Disneyland was a great experience. I have been there about 4 times. There is no ride you will not like. It is a family friendly park and is great for all ages. Fast passes are free just scan your ticket at the ride. But make sure you arrive early. I would recommend Tokyo Disneyland to all travellers.
236,4,19-May,Australia,What's not to love,"We had so much fun at Tokyo Disneyland. I must admit I wasn't particularly looking forward to going to a theme park and was just doing it for the kids but honestly I had just as much fun as them.Such a great experience for families to go on rides together. Lots of laughs.We made sure we got to the park about half an hour before opening and rushed to get our first fast pass. We then enjoyed as many rides as we could. Within a couple of hours we had gone on about 5 and then got our next fast pass. It was got extremely crowded by lunch time, we went on a Monday. We noticed the next day it was not as busy as we were staying at a resort nearby. A Tuesday might be quieter. The longest queuing time was and 80 mins but the Japanese have it down to an art. The keep the lines moving so you always feel like you are getting somewhere.We were totally exhausted by the end after 14 hours of walking and queing but totally worth it. "
237,5,19-May,Australia,fun day out,"What a fun day out, even for us oldies, park is really big, well set out, easy to get too, and lots to do.  many places to eat, things to see and do, some rides for the oldies and young ones too.   had fun.noticed how families dressed the part, dressing the same, lolgreat atmosphere"
238,5,19-Jun,United States,Best Disney Park of all,"We are Florida season pass holders (so a bit biased), BUT this is by far the BEST Disney park.  The parades were incredible, the rides were fabulous!  The only thing we disliked- food and food service were sub-par.  Cast Members were great - most spoke English.  My daughter speaks Japanese, so it made for a very easy trip. We would love to go again.  "
239,4,19-Jan,Malaysia,Winter in disneyland,heading there during winter is super peak season. the park was super crowded. hardly could take any pictures.. or rides.. even lining up for food was stressful. but still it was nice. will have to make another trip during less peak season.
240,5,19-Jun,Australia,Tokyo Disneyland,My daughter and I love Disneyland . Even though it was raining it didn't stop us. Splash mountain was closed which was a shame as I love this ride . Some rides we went on were different to Anaheim Disneyland which was good . We loved thunder mountain and space mountain. Managed to do these a few times . We also loved the electrical parade and the fireworks went ahead as the rain finally stopped . We queued up at the entrance at 7am so we were close to the entrance . Disney hotel guests get in half hour before park opens . Bonus for them. I found 1day was enough for us 
241,3,19-Jun,Malaysia,Nice amusement park  but long lines,"Timing is key. Go in the early mornings, beat the crowd and take a afternoon nap. Then go back around 4pm when its not so hot and by 7pm or so, the crowd would have thinned out."
242,4,19-Apr,Singapore,Never boring although the crowd maybe overwhelming,"I visit Tokyo Disneyland once to twice a year and I never get bored. The crowd levels tend to be crazy throughout the year with the attractions/rides wait time of 1-2 hours are relatively normal. However, even without going for the rides, soaking up in the atmosphere, waiting and watching for the parades, eating, and checking out the shops are still magical.The only criticism I have is the frustrating experience with the roaming characters. They should implement queue system instead of having everyone competing to be picked by the characters for photos and interaction. The characters tend to pick small children or those who dress uniquely."
243,4,19-Jun,Singapore,Prefer DisneySea actually...,"We had been to Universal Studios Japan & DisneySea about 3 years ago, then Legoland Japan about a year after that... just visited Tokyo Disneyland this week.Its attractions & rides are very similar to Hong Kong Disneyland‚Äôs, if not the same. Nothing really spectacular actually. I prefer DisneySea which is quite different. If you had to choose between the two, suggest you visit DisneySea!"
244,3,19-Jun,Singapore,Dont understand ,"Its a problem in language but its nice to visit with good weather, overall its a good chance to come once, bring your kids, its nice to have a walk but try to avoid holidays or festive seasons.Enjoyment 3.5"
245,5,19-May,N/A,Perfect for families with toddlers,GoodPerfect for families with toddlersWe came after the golden week so not much of queue for rides.Staff were so nice.
246,3,19-Mar,Philippines,For kids place,This area is colder compare to other places in Tokyo. It has been 35yrs and it needs renovation. The fireworks in Hongkong is better than here. Its better to try the Disney Sea because its newer. 
247,5,19-May,India,Good theme park for kids,"Tokyo disneyland is a good theme park for the kids. There is a lot of attractions, food courts,Disney characters roaming around the park and the lovely parade during the day as well as in the evening. When we visited  in the 3rd week of May 2019 the fire cracker show scheduled for the evening was cancelled due to the weather conditions. The park is well maintained and kept neat and clean all the time. Maximum time we had to wait in the que was for the roller coaster ride where the waiting time was 45 minutes. Other places waiting time was around 30 minutes. The honey pop corn was very good."
248,5,19-May,India,A very enjoyable visit !! ,This Disney park has some attractions that are different from some of their other parks so what we did was not to re do the ones we had already experienced (except a few that we love like Buzz Light Year ride)... the park is big and has almost 6 theme sub parks so going to each of them was great! Loved the experience since Disney is all about enjoying it all like a little child!   Express Pass was not necessarily helpful since all express passes have a certain time per ride that we could use. Unlike other parks where there is a separate lane for express pass holders where those can be used any time. A lovely ride! There is another park connected through mono rail called Disney Sea (about 5-7 min away) which is also a very good experience and therefore unless one knows Disney well enough covering both these in a day can be very taxing! These parks are huge and queues can be very long! That said the experience of being in Disney is always magical and we loved every bit of it !! Was super 
249,5,18-Jul,Japan,Love this place ,"I had been there with my friends in last summer,it was a perfect place spend your holiday,one of the best attraction to see in chiba perfecture which was near by Tokyo.We tried some of the games which makes us so much fun,mountain splash was interesting and don‚Äôt miss Disney parade.Recommended !! "
250,2,19-Jun,Indonesia,Not recommended ,"If you hate crowd, do not go to disneyland. I went to Osaka Universal Studio, & the crowd were so much better than here. The number of visitors are just overwhelming. The rides are 80%for kids up to 8years old (who finds it fun). Teenagers should go to DisneySea. Line up for pretty much everything, whether it‚Äôs rides, foods, snacks or even vending machines! Lining up for rides takes 60-70mins per ride!They also love to ‚Äòtag‚Äô place (alongside the pavement) to watch the carnival. "
251,4,19-Jun,N/A,Very similar to all other Disney lands,We came to Tokyo for the Disney Sea as this has more variation to other Disney parks. But whilst here we got a day here too. You choose your day when you buy tickets and can not hop between parks. As such you don‚Äôt get people leaving early as they have multiple day passes or because they‚Äôre heading to the other park to see a show or fireworks. Crowd calendar said Wednesday would be quite but it wasn‚Äôt. We had the same poor selection of food as at Disney Sea and queues were long. Again everything is in Japanese and very few people can speak more than a word in English. For a big organisation like Disney I‚Äôd expect part of the job description to be able to get by in English. Most countries that have their own language speak English as the second language so would be able to get by better. The only attraction that offered us a kind of tablet with a translation on was the tiki rooms. I don‚Äôt think there was anything unique about this park which is a shame as it would have been nice to have some Japanese themed rides and section. Easter here seems to last 3 months and they have all the major characters done like an Easter egg which makes for nice photos if nothing else. 
252,1,19-Jun,N/A,Worst theme park ever ,"It is the very worst theme park that I had ever been. All coasters for kids were closed.  As a result, other attractions were too crowded. The waiting time is over 40mins. Furthermore, one of the shows do not allow us to enter and the stuff told us that it is because you are unlucky.  I cannot understand how could this happen in Disneyland. I believe this terrible experience is because of the poor management of the park.  There is no way that so many coasters are closed and only allow whose are ‚Äúlucky‚Äù to watch the show. "
253,5,19-May,India,Dreams come true!,An excellent place for kids and grown up as it makes everyone feel young at heart! The rides are amazing and so is the staff! Must watch - Disney parade at night (a million lights) at 7:30 pm!
254,4,19-Mar,United Kingdom,Jam Packed and the queues are counted in hours not minutes.,I am only providing a good review because it is unfair to rate it bad due to the amount of people. Also there are some attractions that are only for Japanese. The rides are also very mild compare only to Alton towers (UK). The food queue line is also extremely long. One thing I would really comment on is that Japanese people are very polite and the weather is nice. Their queues are very organised and you don't have people attempting to cut the line.There is also a fair amount of events and happenings ( disney characters) coming out to take pictures with children. Most of them do really look like the characters in Disney and that is an amazing makeup skill.
255,3,19-May,Japan,First Disney experience: I expected more!!,"Took the teenage grandkids to Disneyland, a first for them and me.....Everything is very slick and totally what you'd expect from Disneyland but.........After about an hour I realised it was a business not a magical place, maybe this was my Easter Bunny moment...We were there mid week so the number of people wasn't overwhelming yet we waited 25-40 minutes for each attraction, fastpass or not, and once in the attraction it was over in 5-10 minutes....Part of the park was closed so we didn't get a chance to line up for Splash Mountain...I looked and looked for Mickey Mouse, I was hoping to see him roaming the streets and eventually found his house, there was a 50 minute wait to see him so I gave that a miss...We arrived soon after opening and stayed till after the evening light parade. Food and drinks were about double the cost of fast food outside the Park and very limited menu selections, didn't find any vegetarian main meals...The staff were all excellent and we took the train to Maihama Station which ran very frequently and put us within a 10 minute walk to the Park Gates....."
256,5,19-Apr,United Kingdom,Disney.. with extra queues,"I wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland/DisneySea ever since I first heard about them.(Only Shanghai left to do now üòÄ).The queues are huge ( not as bad as DisneySea) but  I had been on most of the rides elsewhere it didn't really matter, and the shows are in Japanese so we didn't go to them.We got there early and stayed all day, the afternoon parade was fun, the night parade is fantastic. And this is the disney castle you can go inside.The atmosphere is pure Disney what's not to love?"
257,5,19-May,Singapore,Magical Experience,A truly immersive experience! We went mid-week and the crowds can be borderline overwhelming (the place is just swarming with people) but one could still manage to get in a decent number of rides (with two pre-schoolers and two senior citizens in tow) while soaking in the atmosphere and enjoying the parades. Truly a magical experience!
258,5,19-May,United States,Disneyland!,I grew up in SoCal going to Disney‚Äîbeen to Orlando and Paris as well.  And this was great too.  You have to go mid week to avoid the worst crowds.  I‚Äôm really glad I went again even though I‚Äôm over 50!
259,4,19-May,United Kingdom,Usual Disney magic,"When it comes to Disney parks you're going to get more of the same here, the only disappointing thing is if you want to ride the popular rides you need to be there for rope drop to get paper fast passes as they dont have an app based version (like Disney world)The app they do have is workable however its only available in Japanese if you've been to Disney before it follows the same basic ride location. The park itself is very clean and immaculate throughout, well worth a trip."
260,5,19-May,Philippines,Happiest place on Earth - Japan has it!,"Of course, Disneyland is the Happiest Place on Earth, and Japan has it along with Disneysea at Maihama. Easily accessible from the airports and train stations. Take the rides or just walk along the park! Enjoy!!!"
261,3,19-May,United States,Mini version of any other Disney Park,We have been to Disney in California and Florida several times and this park offered nothing really different or spectacular. At times you felt you were at any Disney park and not in Tokyo
262,5,19-May,N/A,Magical place! Loved it!,"Easy to get to by train. We bought tickets there, as the only online ticket options required us to print it out (universal studios in osaka can scan a mobile voucher why cant disneyland?). Luckily the line wasnt very long to buy tickets. We ended up getting there about 9.30 (opening was 9am that day).We had heard how busy it can be, and made sure to time our visit on a weekday to avoid the bigger crowds. There were still large crowds but the lines were all pretty manageable. We managed to get a few fast passes for some of the longer waits so we could go do other things. Despite reading warnings about how early the fast passes run out, we managed to get one last one for space mountain at about 6pm (for 9pm). I guess it was a quieter day and less people were using them.Its all in Japanese of course, so we focused on the rides rather than the shows. They are all mostly aimed at the younger crowd, space mountain was about as thrill seeking as it got. If you want the bigger rollercoasters etc universal studios in osaka is much better.We still had a fabulous time and managed to pretty much do all the rides we wanted (and a few twice). Plenty to entertain for all ages. Food was as usual expensive as per theme parks, and not particularly impressive (we didnt go to any of the fancier sit down restaurants so cant comment on them). The night parade was just spectacular (if you arent interested in the parades be warned they have to close off the street so you may get stuck on the wrong side trying to get to a ride for a little while).Didnt get a chance to come here last time I was in Japan but it was a fantastic day and I‚Äôm so glad I got to go this time."
263,5,19-May,Singapore,Amazing and magical experience,"The experience and music was very uplifting and magical, giving a very happy mood! The crowd was not too bad as well as we went on a weekday! The night parade was definitely worth staying for!"
264,4,18-Jun,United Kingdom,Magical Happiness,A very pleasant place where magic surrounds the lands. Cutest/best in the world Disney merchandise can be found here. Great traditional rides. Fun for all the family.
265,4,19-May,Singapore,Happiest & most crowded place on earth!,"Arrived at Disneyland entrance about 8.30am and it was already crowded with people. Manage to get into disneyland at about 9.30am as there was security check before entering. Make sure you check the park opening hours before your visit.Strollers are available for rental at a fee. There are plenty of stroller parks outside of each ride.As it was my first visit, I did not know how the fast pass work and only realised almost towards end of my visit after googling online. I tried asking the staff near the fast pass machine but non of us understand each other as she spoke japanese and i speak english.The fast pass is free for all visitors. You will need to go to the fast pass machine for those popular rides and scan your admission ticket. A tag with the allocated time for your ride will be issued. You can then go for other rides while you wait for the allocated time to visit the ride that you took the fast pass. Hope this info helps. The rides are fun but some have height restriction. Stay for the night parade as the night comes alive with the neon lights. I waited for the fireworks but 5 mins before they announced that the show is cancelled due to 'bad' weather??? ( But I can see the moon!). The biggest disappointment."
266,4,18-Nov,United Kingdom,Disney!!,"It‚Äôs Disneyland but with a Japanese twist - and we loved it! We had a great day out. Some really great rides, friendly staff, good layout and great fun. Parade was very good.I‚Äôd recommend arriving early even if you‚Äôve booked tickets because the queue to get in is huge, even on quiet days. "
267,5,19-Apr,Australia,Touch of magic,"How does one rate Disneyland? Put it simply, it‚Äôs Disneyland period. It is where magic, and all things wonderful and happy lives. No matter how old or young; how many times; or how many Disneyland one has visited, nothing matters once you get there.To be honest, I have never been to one myself and so the first time is always going to be unique and I haven‚Äôt got the luxury to compare to others in the world. But what I can say about Tokyo Disneyland is that it is extremely well organised and especially with crowd, they are also well managed. Whilst every review and advise is to get to the park early, and to get to the fast passes, I personally think one can go there at a reasonable hour and agree that fast passes should be obtained as soon as possible but one may find themselves lucky to get in line and move along nicely. There may be a slight wait, but often than not, it is not a massive long wait. The only turn off is the fact that most rides or featured display are stated in Japanese. Understandably that it is Disneyland in Japan, and the language of the country should be respected, but for visitors, it lost a bit of the thrill when they can‚Äôt understand a word. The parades in the day and night is also magnificent. The night ones is an awesome display of colours and lights. Food in the park varies from proper restaurant to the larger fast food type. In my opinion, the fast food option isn‚Äôt as worth the money as if you go to one of the restaurants. And these restaurants can be pre-reserved so it is highly recommend that when you first enter the park, check the map and decide on one so that you can make that booking at your preferred time. "
268,3,19-May,N/A,Disney with teens,Very unorganised Disney park.confusing.very crowded.each ride takes 2 hours.no one guides u on the fast passes.a tip u can go to any machine and get fast pass which is very important for rides.or else ur visit to park will be disastrous.
269,5,19-May,United Kingdom,What a great day out!,"This was something we decided to do because we had a spare day in Tokyo and we were so pleased that we did. It was easy to get to, the queues were virtually non existent and the Fastpass system in place allows you to skip a queue if there is one. The merchandise was a bit pricey but not having been to Disney in America or Paris I have nothing to compare this with. They put a huge amount of energy into the parades and nothing is too much trouble. "
270,5,19-Mar,United States,Just another disneyland (but still fun!),"Less unique than DisneySea, Tokyo Disneyland is really just another Disneyland but this is great for children who love all Disneys. The Small world has cuter touches than HK and Paris. We beelined for the monsters inc. fast pass and got in line for Winnie the Pooh which is also more unique in Tokyo. Other than that, the shows are in japanese so we skipped but enjoyed getting on familiar rides. "
271,1,19-Apr,N/A,"Worst Disney Park visit (poor character interaction, long lines for everything and just plain confusing)","My partner and I went to visit Disneyland and Disney SEA. I had researched the park and had heard quite good things about it. Many said they had some of the best rides and parades they‚Äôve ever seen. I had also heard about many rare character opportunities. I am an ex-Cast Member of WDW and have also been to Disneyland. My partner has visited WDW, Disneyland (CA), Hong Kong Disneyland and Disneyland Paris. I also speak a little bit of Japanese. Enough to get me by. So I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre pretty qualified to an opinion on this park.With high hopes we arrived at the monorail station. We were surprised that you had to pay money to hop on the monorail as the monorail is free at other parks. The signage wasn‚Äôt very clear but we made our way to Disney SEA on the first day. The park was over crowded. We entered at park open and the lines were already at 3 hours. WDW‚Äôs Pandora lines are nothing compared to these lines!The only park maps at the entrance are in Japanese. We didn‚Äôt find out until the end of the day that you had to REALLY LOOK for the maps that were in other languages. Whereas in WDW maps in 7 different languages are right in front of you when you enter the park.We lined up for an hour at the Raging Spirits ride in hopes that the fast pass line would die down so that we could secure one. We managed to secure one at 12:45pm so we were pretty happy with that. However we were disappointed to find out that we had to wait 2 hours until we could get our next fast pass (meaning they would probably all run out).And surprise surprise. We checked on a website (because foreigners can‚Äôt use the Tokyo Disney app) all the fast passes had run out. Except for Tower of Terror! We ran there and tried to scan our fast passes. They said we had to wait 3 minutes until we could get one and told us to wait to the side. Then they let a bunch of people in and they took the remaining fast passes and they closed the kiosk within 30 seconds.We went on the Raging Spirits ride and it was quite a disappointment. Not a lot of theming and quite a low thrill level (despite being advertised as a thrill ride). At this point we hadn‚Äôt seen any characters, lines for food and toilets were half an hour long and the ride lines were even longer. We lined up for 3 hrs and 15 minutes for Journey to the Centre. Was a fantastic ride and would say it was the best experience we had so far.As we decided to leave, we saw three of the Aristocats characters. But they were swarmed with people (apparently lines for pop up characters aren‚Äôt a thing). We also popped into a store and bought some Duffy merch. We held off on some of our purchases as we thought there‚Äôd be more in the main park (we had seen people with other merch that wasn‚Äôt in the stores). To our dismay, there was no way to know that Duffy merch was only available in Disney SEA. We only discovered that once we went to Disneyland the next day.When we went to Disneyland we thought we were much more prepared after experiencing the disappointment that was Disney SEA. Disneyland was a much smaller version of Disneyland CA or Magic Kingdom. The layout was similar, but a little different in some ways. At this park we only managed to ride Star Tours and watch the half Japanese and half English Country Bear Jamboree (which we really appreciate the addition of English!). But alas it had the same issues. Ridiculous lines, rude people and no English whatsoever. The one redeeming factor was that they had rare characters at the entrance at all times. But the way they did it was VERY strange. Face characters had lines. However fur characters had swarms of people. No lines. And you had to wait for the character to pick you for a photo. Which was an issue because you‚Äôd have people pushing you backwards trying to yell at the character for their attention. I went to get a photo with Eeyore and thankfully it didn‚Äôt take too long for me to get chosen! I went in for a hug and I guess Eeyore didn‚Äôt feel like hugs that day (I don‚Äôt think hugging is big in Japan). I didn‚Äôt let that bother me as I understand there can be cultural differences. However there was no character interaction whatsoever. Even when I spoke in Japanese.I ended up meeting Clarice later on. She was much more welcoming, however it took about half an hour to get a photo as parents would push their children at her feet, almost tripping her over! As an ex-entertainment CM I was shocked that the character attendants did NOTHING to stop this.It was quite the disappointment. Normally my partner and I are at parks from open until close. However we ended up leaving early on both days as it was just far too hectic. Want shorter lines? Visit Disneyland CA on New Years Eve. Will be half the craziness!Would 100% recommend skipping Tokyo Disney. Go to Disneyland CA or WDW instead."
272,5,19-May,New Zealand,Make Disneyland a must do in Japan,"We visit Disneyland every time we come to japan from when our children were 8 months til our most recent trip where they are now 7, Disneyland has a great range of rides and attractions to suit different ages. Take your own lunch and buy snacks from the endless popcorn vendors or other snack carts. Lots of opportunity to meet Disney characters but lines tend to be long and we skip these, preferring to get onto rides. Make good use of fast pass ticketing to avoid very long queues on popular rides."
273,4,19-May,Russia,Make sure you read all the blogs and guides you can find online!,"We went as a family of 4 (parents with 1 schooler and toddler), went during what was considered low season (7-9 May, Tue-Thu) and enjoyed pretty much 1.5 days in Disneyland (we bought 3-days magicpass and park hop on the third day).Even during a low season, queues can vary from 5-90 min. We were considered lucky and managed to take a few rides with waiting time below 15 min. Nevertheless, we skipped those thrill rides since we were with the young kids.Plan well, read all the blogs and guides you can find online (we did spent quite significant time on this) if you want to enjoy the themepark with less fuss. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the facility was clean, plenty of benches all over the park. As a parent, I would advise bringing a picnic mat or a light portable stool (we saw locals doing that), so one may sit in queue, rest on the ground while waiting for the parade or show.May can still be chilly by the evening so do bring jumpers or wind-breakers.Can't say enough about reading more and planning well - otherwise, one can easily waste an entire day and not achieving much."
274,5,19-Apr,Philippines,Best Disneyland-style park in the world,"Tokyo Disneyland is like the ""Greatest Hits"" Disneyland. It has all the best classic Disneyland rides from other countries but spruced up and maintained to Japanese standards. Needless to say, it is very clean, organized, and well-maintained. It is crowded compared to even the US parks but if you do your research and plan well, you'll have a great time."
275,1,19-Apr,Australia,Could not pre purchase tickets then tix rejected at gate.,"I tried to save time and drama by pre-purchasing tickets online only for my Australian CC -VISA to be rejected despite the bank assuring me everything was hunky dory with the card. I then purchased tickets through Viator.com only to have the tickets not recognised at the gate, all this mind you after lining up since 7am in order to purchase their fast pass tickets. Subsequently we lost our position in the queue and my young daughter was left in tears. I did not find the Tokyo Disneyland staff particularly helpful or sympathetic to our plight. The only staff member who came to help us addressed us with ""I don't speak English"". Luckily I speak Japanese and was also with a Japanese friend who explained the situation to her - fruitlessly as it turns out. We ended up having a disroganised, messed up day."
276,5,19-May,N/A,Such fun! ,This is the 4th Disney I have visited and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. It was super busy but I still enjoyed every second of it. It‚Äôs a small world in Japanese is just brilliant.. Staff were all friendly and some spoke a little English. If you are in Tokyo I would recommend going.
277,5,19-Mar,United Kingdom,Disney Magic as I know it.,Disneyland Tokyo held the magic we had come to expect. The rides were familiar so was the hospitality of the staff. We found the staff helpful and if possible prepared to help in anyway they could to make the day enjoyable. Although the park was very busy due to school holidays the number of rides and entertainments meant that although crowded  it didn't make it unbearable as our experience the day before and Tokyo Sea. A good day which left us feeling in good. Well done Tokyo Disneyland
278,5,18-Jun,N/A,Worth the visit,"I have been to Tokyo Disney a couple of times and it has never disappointed Staff are fantastic it‚Äôs clean , the fast tracks are free but you still need to time your rides as they do get very busy Food is well priced for an amusement park and not bad either Get in early and stay late , good day out"
279,2,19-May,N/A,Everything is in japanese and that sucks!,"Abselutly everything is in japanese, all the rides,showes and staff only speak japanese. That really sucked and you had to wait for 40-110minutes for every ride"
280,5,19-May,Australia,Excellent family day out ,We went to Disney not our first timeBut the first time with our three year old. A lot of people said Disney is only for grown up children but I have to tend to disagree. We spent a whole day here and there was so much to see and a do with our three year old we went on a lot of rides and shows and also ate at the Japanese restaurant. Really would recommend Tokyo Disney especially on a weekday when we went as it was not that busy.
281,5,19-Mar,Australia,A magical Day,"Tokyo Disneyland is as magical experience for every visitor. Based off the original Disneyland, this park features many of the much loved classic attraction and disney characters. The highlight of my day was the nighttime Parade, a must do for any visitor at the park. I highly recommend getting a snack and lining up 1 hour before the parade starts for a great viewing spot."
282,5,19-Apr,Australia,Well worth it,The family had a great day on the rides.  Best advice is to get the Fast track tickets.  You can get them every two hours. This enables you to get entry to the ride at a specific time frame and jump the normal queue. Only certain rides have them and certain one go quickly. Highly recommend the space rides and the gold mine roller coaster. Food was reasonably priced for a theme park but would suggest eating around 11am to avoid the crowds. We didn‚Äôt prepurchase the tickets and went on a Tuesday which is one of the more quieter days. One of us went to the ticket counter whilst the rest of the family waited in the entry line. Suggest you get there well ahead of opening time.
283,4,19-Apr,N/A,Technical problems,"We visited Disneyland on a Wednesday and found that it was quite busy despite being a weekday. The park was easy to get to from Tokyo station by metro. We arrived around midday and there was a very small queue to buy tickets which was a nice surprise. Once inside, we rushed to the Monsters Inc ride - being one of the most popular rides here, we wanted to get a Fast Pass. Unfortunately the ride was closed unexpectedly due to technical issues, which was disappointing. We were advised to keep checking back during the day, which we did although it meant that this was time we could have used elsewhere in the park. It did open again but then closed a few times too - the queue was at least an hour long and they did not allow Fast Pass access. We eventually went on the ride at the end of the day after the fireworks, when the queue was much smaller.The park itself was clean and the staff were all very friendly. We enjoyed watching the parades from the Tomorrowland area - the Disney castle was therefore in the background and made for great photos. The fireworks  display at the end of the day was disappointing compared to other Disney parks as it did not last long.All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed the day and would certainly return. A few tips:- They have special stickers to wear for special occasions, available at Guest Relations (eg birthday).- The park map has a useful summary of all of the eateries and the kind of food they sell. Saves time so you know what to look for. Highly recommend the strawberry churros at Critter Country! - You can check in advance on the website what attractions etc will be closed for refurbishment and when."
284,3,19-Apr,Australia,Disney Mad Crush Not a Great Experience,"Went on the 5th April and it was an absolute mad scramble. Although not during school holidays and during weekday, the number of people queuing up by 7:30am was enormous. We could not work out which queue was for tickets and which was for entry. When the gates opened, it was like the running of the bulls at Pamplona and many people running in with heaps of pushing and shoving. After seeing many young kids cry near the Buzz light year ride to shoot those aliens, I really did question why one would want to bring their child here.It is impossible to get on every ride in one day and using the fastpass system allows you get on more than you would. It very much is catered to locals with many having a yearly pass.I was also surprised that people start hogging spots for the parade from 10am in the morning and it creates a hazard and slows you down. Frankly Disney should stop people squatting for seats so early.My tip is run for the furthest rides away from the entry that are good and then move to get your first fastpass while you line up for your next ride and then just repeat getting fastpasses when you can for the big rides. However by 1pm, many attractions have already closed for fastpasses. For example Thunder mountain ride fastpass obtained at 11am was for a ride at 5pm. Tells you that Disney are admitting too many people in one day to be able to enjoy the experience. The night is a massive crush to, so you are better off watching the parade from the Western World. Restaurant food - you are also looking at at least 800Yen per person over and probably closer to 1,300Yen for a proper meal and that's not even in the top notch restaurant."
285,3,19-Mar,Singapore,Not so bad,"Experienced was ok. Very good for kids, not so much for adults. I thought we're going to see fireworks at night but turned out,it will be just a short show."
286,5,18-May,Australia,Fun for everyone!,When in Tokyo what better place to tae the kids then disney! We loved it so much we came back the next day to disneysea.
287,5,19-Apr,Australia,Great fun for everyone,"Great fun for adults and kids alike. There are plenty of rides, attractions and the usual overpriced carnival food/souvenirs that you would expect to find. The wait for popular rides is usually over an hour if you don‚Äôt use the fast pass system. Scan your entry ticket once per hour at the fast pass booths next to the ride and in an hour or so you can join the fast line which moves much faster.I found it best to get your fast pass as soon as you get off each ride and enjoy some side shows in between to ensure you spend as little time in lines as possible. "
288,5,19-Apr,United Kingdom,Magical ,We‚Äôve been to Disney Florida/California/Paris in the past but have to say this is the cleanest Disney park we‚Äôve been to! The staff are so friendly and welcoming. The rides are fantastic. There‚Äôs food to suit both western and eastern cuisines. A dream come true getting to visit this park. 
289,2,19-Apr,Switzerland,Disappointing & sometimes heartless,"We visited Tokyo Disneyland & DisneySea on two consecutive days in April. The parks themselves are beautifully done and spotless. We visited on workdays hoping for smaller crowds but both parks were completely overcrowded, which meant that even the rides for very small children had incredibly long lines. We ended up waiting behind hoards of teenagers (?) for small children‚Äôs rides that essentially lasted five seconds. No seriously, some of the rides were so short it was ridiculous! My daughter (5) also experienced some things that were unforgivable in my eyes, being pushed out of the way by hoards of teenagers to get up to a disney character. This of course isn‚Äôt the park‚Äôs fault but the ‚Äòdisney character‚Äô in question did nothing to right the wrong and she was ignored for 5 minutes before we eventually gave up! We also got up to a long line of grownups (!) waiting to take a picture with mickey mouse, we proceeded to the back of the line, as my daughter was really excited about having her picture taken with Mickey but a rude lady did a cross with her arms and said ‚Äúno!‚Äù. I asked her if she was really going to send away a little girl and she just gave a heartless ‚Äúyes!‚Äù. So much for the magic of Disney! In other parks it‚Äôs all about the kids but this was really lost here! The woman‚Äôs response brings me to my next point, the lack of English. Many staff members speak next to no English and there are NO subtitles on ANY of the rides. We found this really lazy and as it‚Äôs an easy fix, we‚Äôre not sure why nothing has been done about this! We‚Äôre from Switzerland and regularly go to a park in Germany that manages to do everything in 3 languages, so it can be done! Essentially it wasn‚Äôt as magical as we were hoping for! :("
290,5,18-Dec,Singapore,Fantastic wonderful Place,Purchase a 3 day pass.  Spent 2 days at Disneyland.  The place is really crowded.  Long queue to go in.  Do bring picnic mat for sitting while waiting for shows during the cold season.
291,5,19-Apr,Australia,Great for family holiday,"We did a day trip with our 3 year old and it was great, she is small but was still big enough for plenty of the rides and we could go on with her, the wait times weren‚Äôt too long and the food options were great, the staff were so happy and so great with kids and were also very helpful. Loved it. the nighttime spectacular and the glow float parade was amazing."
292,4,19-Apr,Canada,Great place to have fun,"Tokyo Disneyland is a place to have fun in the typical Disney fashion. This park is also vast so wear good shoes and prepare to walk a lot. Lines, for rides, can get pretty lengthy ,so take advantage of a Fast Pass when available.There are lots of restaurants and food carts scattered throughout the park for your convenience. When you book from abroad, Tokyo Disneyland does not make it easy to purchase tickets. There is no on line support/chat for international travellers -- only by phone. You are not guaranteed to get an English speaking cast member. Also Park hopper passes are not available."
293,5,19-Apr,Australia,Fantastic Family Day,"Three adults and two small children tackled the crowds early in April.  It was the day before the school holidays started but it was definitely crowded.  However, we did expect this and planned ahead - which meant rushing to the popular rides first, then taking our time walking around, taking photos and eating.  It was a great day, beautiful weather but the two boys were exhausted.  We booked our tickets on line, not easy to do from Australia we discovered but there was absolutely no one in the queue to buy tickets on the day! So we could have got tickets on the day.  We also elected to get a car and driver to take us there and pick us up - expensive yes but very handy at 6pm with two exhausted boys who fell asleep on the drive home. We also got there at 7.45am - early and we expected to beat the crowds but I think everyone had the same idea.  Park opens at 8am and it was crowded!  The Dumbo ride was a minute long and was not worth the over an hour wait, but the Star Tours ride was excellent, Buzz Lightyears Astro Blasters was very good, Monsters Inc Ride and Go Seek was ok, Peter Pan's Flight was good and Tom Sawyer's Island was a nice respite.  Overall it was a fun day.  Disneyland is aimed at a younger audience (the boys were 8 & 4) and it was good for them.  Take a back pack, wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to queue."
294,5,19-Apr,United States,first Tokyo visit,loved our first visit here.  similar to Disneyland and Magic Kingdom but it has its own uniqueness. must see
295,5,19-Apr,United Kingdom,Disney!,"went on 9th april. Wait times really good compared to Paris, used a couple of fast passes etc. We missed splash mountain as we went to Monsters inc and by then wait times were 80 mins so decided to skip it, splash mountain seems to have the longest wait to do it first!. Food prices were incredibly cheap. We had a large mickey shaped ice cream sandwich which cost ¬£2.50, look at 10 euros in Paris. Lunch we had 4 mains, Japanese curry, and 2 iced coffees, came to ¬£40. Lunch in euro cost us ¬£50 for 2 mains and a snack. Rides did seem a little tamed down compared to Paris, but still good fun. Disney stuff also very reasonable, but we got our t-shirts at uniqlo."
296,5,19-Apr,Colombia,Good time ,The food prices were reasonable. Lines moved fast. Recommend the Disney app- wait times were accurate. Fun family experience. Worth the use of a day when visiting Tokyo. We did the 2 day pass and it was economical and worth our time and money 
297,4,19-Apr,Australia,Fabulous day out,"Very easy to access by train. Incredible amount of shops. 3 parades a day. Our favorite rides were Star Tours, jungle river and buzz lightyear. We spent 8 hours there and didn‚Äôt get to see everything. The attention to detail is second to none. The staff are full of big smiles and waves. The food was a bit disappointing - there was plenty to choose from but it was your typical junk food and was very expensive. "
298,5,19-Apr,Philippines,Magical Place in Asia,An awesome experience in Asia. It's pretty close the one in the US though most shows are in Japanese. The rides and food are closely the same with some special stuff like the alien mochi and special asian flavoured popcorns.It was a great trip for us and I enjoyed how clean it is! **though character greeting is a bit all-over the place...the rides and organization is superb!
299,4,19-Apr,Philippines,disney magic,one of the better disney parks that I've been too. make sure to get the different flavored popcorns with the character containers. i loved how clean everything was and how efficient the lines were. shows are in japanese but kids can still relate. 
300,5,19-Apr,Philippines,We love the amazing food,We went to ten Disney parks all over the globe this year and we absolutely enjoyed Tokyo Disneyland. The food was amazing and the Easter parade was spectacular. We lined up for 70 minutes at toon town to take a photo with Mickey wearing the fantasmic costume and it was worth it. Pls try the Katsu burger at toon town and the cinnamon churros.
301,4,19-Apr,Singapore,huge and crowded!,"i arrived at about 11am, so there was not a crowd at the gates.. proceeded to have my lunch first at the Japanese restaurant first since there is no crowd.. had my lunch and proceeded to all the attractions.. not a fan of rides so my wife and i were basically walking around and enjoying all the views and buying the souvenirs from the shops.. i went on a weekday and i feel the crowd is manageable so my advice is try not to go on a weekend cos i think the crowd will be overwhelming.."
302,3,19-Apr,Norway,"Disneyland, the safest choice","This was the final Disney park I had to visit on my quest to having been to all Disney resorts in the World.After a little disappointing day at the DisneySea (see my other review), this made us feel back home and happy again.Specially doing the classic rides Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain and Space Mountain gave us the Disney experience we wanted. And the night light parade was amazing! There are some things they should do something about to make it even better in my eyes:1) I know this is a Japanese park, but this is the only park in the world with next to no English on their rides. Thus making the dark rides almost useless, and a little more difficult for international visitors.2) They MUST do something about how many people they let in! There actually must be a way to have a full capacity and sell out because it was really over crowded. This was even on a regular weekday and we were told it is twice as many during the weekends, which must be unbearable. Tokyo is a huge city and most people can afford the steap Disney prices so something needs to be done!3) The official Disney stores products both inside and outside the park was not up to standard. On every single Disney we've been to in the world the suitcase have been filled with quality Disney merch such as limited edition artwork etc. This was not to be found at any stores in Tokyo, although we found some better quality products at the Disney Store in Shibuya. "
303,4,19-Apr,N/A,Fun day at the park ,"Very busy, visited on a Tuesday, queues were around 30-45 min, very crowded. No big rides in this park. Space mountain is not like Paris / America if you have been to these parks with the bigger upside down roller coasters. Able to get fast passes around the park. The castle looks spectacular as always. More geared up for smaller children and families with regards to rides. But all in all a fun day out with fun food I haven‚Äôt had in other parks. If you want character photos, I learnt that you have to wave at the and they willCome over to you, not like Paris were you have to queue up. "
304,1,19-Apr,Australia,Packed with thousands of people ,You can not breath ! They sell their tickets more than it‚Äôs capacity!  Long cues for every single ride. Again no English ! 
305,4,19-Apr,Japan,"No english, and nobody speak it!","All attractions, all workers all movies are in japaneese only.the park is amazing ofc.nothing to say, but super expensive to enter and to eat/drinkprepare your wallet with cash!"
306,4,18-Nov,Brunei,We Recommend,"The Happiest Place on earth (aside from universal studious), my daughter loved the place as well for my wife when we have taken a picture with mickey mouse my wife is ecstatic. too bad it rained during the night parade but so far everything is nice, a memorable place to visit"
307,3,19-Apr,Mongolia,Crowds and lines were immense,"We had the dubious misfortune of being there the week before the start of the Japanese school year (2nd week of April), and every student was at Disneyland. According to the Crowd Counter app, there were 65k people there every day that week. The most basic rides had very long waits and Fast Pass was done by little after noon. The park is nevertheless spotlessly clean and orderly, but the crowds were too much and the waits took away the fun. Wouldn't return.  Can say the same for DisnleySea. "
308,5,19-Apr,United States,Very similar to Disney world,"This was our 4th Disney (including Hong Kong, Orlando and Shanghai) this one was very close to Orlando, compared to the others in Asia, this one is very big. The only down side were the staff. Found that a lot did not speak English compared to other Disney‚Äôs and a lot were very rude. Felt this was the least magical experience of all the Disney‚Äôs so far."
309,4,19-Jan,Australia,Tons of fun for all ages,"We visited as a family and had way more fun than I thought we would! The day we visited in January wasn't too busy so the wait times for rides were all under 45 minutes. It was very cold, so if you're visiting in January rug up. The rides were fab. The Peter Pan ride was a family favourite, as was the Buzz Lightyear ride. The older kid/adult loved Space Mountain. The It's a Small World ride was a strange one, go on it if you want the song stuck in your head for the next year and if you want to feel like Lisa Simpson when she was tripping. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride was pretty good too. The parade is a must to watch, day and night. Plenty of characters wandering around, they do get mobbed but as the park wasn't crazy busy we managed to get some photos with them. Food was pretty good, there's a good selection available including for fussy kids. We especially loved the Mickey Mouse mini pizzas. It was a shame that some rides were closed in Toon Town while we were there, my husband was very sad he couldn't go on the Roger Rabbit ride lol. If you go in winter make sure you stop in the jail in Toon Town, there are heater vents which are delightful to stand under and defrost! Merch is expensive, as one would expect, but there is a big variety. Overall a fab place to spend a day/evening. We all loved it! We were there from open til close but still didn't manage to do everything. Would definitely need more than 1 day here on busy days."
310,1,19-Apr,N/A,Place was great! But do NOT buy a ticket from trip advisor for here.,"I really enjoyed my visit here but forewarning do NOT buy a buy a ticket from trip advisor for here. I wasted 30 minutes at the ticket booth with the staff being confused by my ticket I got through trip advisor and told me they would not accept it because it was not an official disneyland ticket through them. The ticket I bought through trip advisor, hoping to save a little time and it was just the same price at Disneyland. However since they would not take my trip advisor ticket I had to pay for the ticket twice! The tickets on trip advisor are 100% not refundable so unless you want to waste $72 just pay for your ticket at the gate, it‚Äôs very simple and the staff are really friendly. I will not be using trip advisor again for any bookings."
311,4,19-Apr,Australia,What a day! Happy birthday mum! ,"We went to Disneyland to celebrate mum‚Äôs 65 birthday! The morning started with going from Shinjuku JR station to Tokyo on Chuou Line rapid ,Tokyo station was OMG , long walk to look for Keiyo Line and get off at Maihama. Once you are out of the station Disneyland is on your right hand side . Buying tickets was so easy , everyone was so friendly and happy. The amount of people in there was unbelievable and waiting time for the rides was about 1 hour on average so buying express tickets if you don‚Äôt want to wait! Everything you buy you have to line up for it some are shorter wait and some are longer wait ! We had a great time at Tokyo Disneyland! "
312,5,19-Mar,Indonesia,An Awesome place for every age,Disney as well known by every generation.. this park give all memories. With fun rides. Accompanied with disney characters
313,5,19-Apr,United Kingdom,Great park,Tokyo Disneyland is a gorgeous park especially during Sakura (cherry blossom season). The park can get exceptionally busy so plan ahead and use fast passes. Lots of unusual snacks to try particularly the popcorn flavours.
314,5,19-Apr,India,One of the best Disney experiences we had,"We have been to 3 different Disney's with our 5 year old daughter and this one is one of the best for kids her age. She could do all rides and loved some very much like Big thunder mountain and Space mountain, Its a small world, Go coaster roller coaster. The best part for us was the electric parade in the evening - with many amazing Tableau The fantasmic show on the castle was one of the best across any Disney's we have seen (and they are all great). The park is small and easy to cover in a day with kidsThe character greeting times are very long. "
315,5,19-Apr,United Kingdom,Disney joy,"The day at Disney was very grey and cold but the experience was lovely. The food outlets were all reasonably priced. The ticket was around ¬£50. The staff were all very helpful and friendly. The postal service, where I sent some postcards was an added bonus!"
316,5,19-Apr,N/A,Why everyone should visit Tokyo Disneyland.,"When it was my big Sisters birthday in Tokyo, I went to Tokyo Disneyland. I think it was a wonderful place to go for someones birthday. Here are my Top 2 reasons why I believe everyone should visit Tokyo Disneyland. Firstly it is so fun because the ride is so crazy ! There were so many people because Tokyo Disneyland is awesome.Finally, the staff are so nice. And the best ride is jet coaster."
317,5,19-Apr,Australia,Great times with the Disney crew,"14 hours on our feet but what a day and boy did we pack some inFrom the rides to the parades and fireworks displays these folks have it down to a fine artVisited on possibly one of the best clear days in April and the staff were brilliant and the park amazingly well kept and clean unlike Euro Disney that resembles a rubbish tipThis is the third Disney Park we‚Äôve visited and by far the cleanest and friendliestWell done all, you are a credit to the park"
318,5,19-Apr,United States,Great Disney Park,"Great Disney Park with wonderful Japanese flair.  Several unique rides like Pooh‚Äôs Honey Hunt and Monster‚Äôs Inc. that are unlike (and better than) similar rides in other Disney Parks.  Plus all the classics like Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, Haunted Mansion, Jungle Cruise (skip if you don‚Äôt speak Japanese), etc.  TDL has maybe my favorite version of Small World and very delicious and affordable snacks like popcorn (350JPY for a box, chocolate and caramel were our favorites) and Little Green Alien Mochi (350JPY for 3).  Get there early and stay late!  Crowds are impressive but the Japanese are very cordial and patient and don‚Äôt seem to mind waiting in crazy long lines for rides, food, characters, you name it.  But if you have a plan and make wise use of fast passes you can have a fun day without standing in any lines of longer than 25 minutes or so.  "
319,5,19-Apr,Australia,Amazing!,My friend and I just got back from a trip to Tokyo and we decided to goto disneyland while we were there. I would recommend going to more than a day if you want to do the rides. There‚Äôs 24/23 rides and we did 12 in two days. It‚Äôs easy to navigate once you get to know each area! 10/10 recommend!
320,5,19-Apr,Philippines,Disneyland Happiest Place,"A trip to Tokyo wont be complete without a trip to Disneyland specially when you have kids. We were planning to spend half day in disneyland and half day in disney sea but kids was having a blast and decided to stay in disneyland the whole day. It wasnt the first disneyland for them but its just tajt its disneyland how can you not stay for the parade. Of course first stop Its a small world our favorite ride. The wait was long but definitely a sight to see. My daughter loves seeing this ride. Since my kids are still young we just rode the jungle train, boat ride, mark twain boat, we watched the 3d show and we ate a lot of mickey mouse food. Then it was time for souvenir shopping while waiting for the parade to start. It was still a cold day in Tokyo but definitely a memorable day for my whole family."
321,4,19-Mar,Japan,Great family fun day,"Get in line early (we were in line an hour before opening). Possibly send someone to get fast passes while the rest of the group gets in line. (I would suggest splash mountain, Winnie the Pooh, space mountain, or thunder mountain railroad, depending on your group). Parks was beautiful, but crowded. Be prepared to wait and be patient. "
322,5,19-Apr,United Kingdom,Disneyland Tokyo ,"AmazingHighlights are the shows and parades One mans dream 2 was well worth the visit and a great show that would be popular at any Disneyland resortThe parades are better than those in the states with the best electrical parade ever. You can view with ease and there was no need to camp out on the route for a good spot despite many people sitting hours before the parade starts. In Japan a lot of people sit on the floor during the parade so if you don‚Äôt mind standing away from the parade you can find a spot that over looks the crowd. Don‚Äôt expect to do everything, the parks are very busy. Get there earlier to get fast passes for the most popular rides as the fast passes close once all are distributed for the day and for the most popular rides this can be by mid day. Rides such as Winnie the poo, monsters inc., thunder mountain, space mountain. If the parks are open until 10, as they were in our visit, you can get on some of the other rides with ease. Our first day we were able to ride tiki rooms, bear jamboree, Pinocchio, Peter Pan, Snow White, small world, jungle cruise, haunted mansion and roger rabbit with ease.There are long queues for quick service and stalls, but if you are as happy with less popular options then you can get served quicklyThere is a band that plays on Main Street that is a must if you can catch them. Again better than any spontaneous show in Disneyland California, florida or Paris. Super friendly and helpful staff, great customer service. What ever japanese people tap in to for this should be bottled and sprinkled over the other parks around the world. I was touched by their smiles and kindnesses adding to magicEven though I could not understand what was said on the jungle cruise the cast member was really convincing funny and had amazing energy. The grotto that you go through mid ride has excellent effects not experienced in any other park listed above. We had a four day park ticket. We were surprised, having read reviews we thought we would like Disney seas better, separate review. Although we loved it, we were drawn back to Disneyland more often.  Our visit was Sunday Monday Tuesday and Wednesday. Surprisingly The Wednesday was the busiest. The start of their Easter event that is very popular in JapanGreat visit "
323,5,19-Apr,New Zealand,Such a awesome Day ,"I can just review this in one word!! Just awesome!!!!!!!. If you going their for the first time try to stay till the very end till 10pm ish !! And try to do all attractions there are plenty and it will take time. You can get a quick access by taking a special ticket. If you can try to avoid school holidays and weekends , cause it‚Äôs get very busy!!!! Like really busy !!! Have fun with your family and friends !! "
324,4,19-Jan,Japan,Fun Date Place,"This place is really wonderful for couples which is ironic because in the US it's more for family and friends. The ticket price particularly for afternoon admission is a real bargain. I went here with my boyfriend, and I had a great time. Everything is really cute, and the alien ice cream mochi are super cool. We went on a really cold day, but we still had a ton of fun watching the parade. And I would really recommend the Stitch show. It was hilarious particularly to adults. The park is very English friendly if you need to speak English. The only real drawback are the lines. The lines are pretty intense unless you go on a weekday which kind of sucks. Because the lines at the Florida one are so much shorter. A 3 hour wait time just isn't that unusual. But if you're willing to split up the single rider lines are awesome. The Buzz Lightyear ride was awesome as always. And Pooh's Honey Hunt, It's a small World, and the Haunted Mansion were all worth seeing. Everyone should go."
325,4,19-Mar,Australia,Be Prepared to Hurry up and Wait,"Disneyland was good , Only issue is there was between a 2 -3 hour wait for all the big rides and we were there on a Wednesday. They had the 35year parade which was excellent all shows and the grounds where what you expect from a Disneyland"
326,4,19-Mar,Australia,Busiest place on Earth?,"Being a Sunday it was possibly the busiest place on earth, but certainly the happiest also. We didn‚Äôt purchase fast passes with kids aged 3 and 10 but for older kids or thrill seekers it would 100% be worthwhile fast passing. We aimed for attractions with a maximum 35 minute wait, with young kids we just couldn‚Äôt justify 3 hour wait times. We even waited 30 minutes for popcorn, it was so hard to get food or a seating area.Great facilities, we enjoyed the different sections and themes, the parade for 35th birthday was fantastic as was the evening parade with floats and characters lit up. Overall we had a great time, Disneyland is a must do. Take jackets so you don‚Äôt freeze at sundown!"
327,5,19-Mar,N/A,Disney is fantastic!!,From the moment you arrive you are greeted with a fantastic and beautiful setting which instantly makes you happy. Everything about this park is fantastic
328,3,19-Mar,United States,Not so happy place on earth,"Crazy crowded.  I will never complain about a 60 minute wait for Space Mountain in Disneyland Anaheim.  The wait at Tokyo Disney can go up to 3 hours!  There‚Äôs a line everywhere, but we still enjoyed it. The Pirates and Haunted Mansion are also the old version rides compare to Disneyland California."
329,5,18-Sep,N/A,True Disney Fans,"We had a great time even with some wet days thrown in. We bought a four day pass for both Disneyland and Disneysea (park hopper)We spent two days in each park. We are Disney nuts and loved it!Highly recommend getting tickets in advance and getting there early. Head to back of the park as soon as you get in and work towards the front to avoid the long queues.The lines are really short after it gets dark. Loved trying all the different flavour popcorn. Winnie the Pooh ride isn‚Äôt like USA parks, can see the parades from the line up to Winnie the Pooh.Electrical Parade was great and enjoyed the Queen of Hearts Banquet hall (no reservations required)Definatley worth a day in each park but if you only have one day do Disney Sea as it‚Äôs unique."
330,5,19-Mar,United States,Great Day at Tokyo Disneyland,"Found the cast members to be friendly and helpful even with the large crowds.  We saw reviews that suggested two days at this park, but if you've been to a Disneyland theme park before, base your time on that experience.  We felt like we did everything we wanted to do in one day.  Three down, three to go."
331,2,19-Mar,United Arab Emirates,Worse Disneyland place,"I visited all Disneyland parks around the world and I can say this is the worst one, long line for ticket no VIP tickets, long line for food, no good attactions and no Disneyland castle which surprised us, we will never return back to this place."
332,5,19-Mar,Australia,Plan plan plan and run run run,"I have visited several Disney parks over the years.  Whilst no expert, I understand better than many as to what you should and shouldn't do to get the most out of your visit. No matter what you hear or research...NOTHING can prepare you for the crowds and lining up required at both Disneyland and Disneysea. We chose a Tuesday for Disneyland and a Wednesday for Disneysea.  There was nothing special about this week - it was not a holiday or busy week in Tokyo.  It was classed as a moderately busy period on the Disney calendar. Even at almost an hour before park opening time there were easily already one thousand ticket holders lining up ahead of us.  This truly surprised me as in my experience a similar Tuesday at Anaheim doesn‚Äôt draw this kind of line an hour before opening.It does not stop there‚Ä¶.. Once inside, you line up for a lengthy period for almost everything from attractions, parades, and food  - even 45 minutes for a cup of coffee. I will note we did not need to line up to use the bathroom at any time which was great (and a welcomed surprise to be honest).  I even saw several groups of people setting themselves up to watch the parade - over three hours before the parade starting time.We are two healthy men and could race around the park easily so we still managed to make the most out of our day and have a terrific time.  I seriously don‚Äôt know how all of you with children manage it - you truly are miracle workers.The park is very clean and runs very smoothly. It has a great Disney atmosphere and all cast members we encountered were happy and helpful. I do think they need to think about adding some coffee carts rather than coffee only being available at the cafes to hopefully reduce the long wait for such a simple purchase.Here are some tips (some are bleedingly obvious but to a novice maybe not):Note: How you spend your first hour is crucial and sets up the rest of your day for success or potential disappointmentBuy your tickets in advance - either online or via a registered seller in TokyoGet there at LEAST one hour in advance before park openingWhilst in line request a park and parade times brochure and start planningDownload TDR Alert which is an app that will show current wait times and whether they have a fastpass available.Decide on your four MUST DO rides and work out a schedule. If any of them have a Fastpass available race to this attraction upon entry to get a return pass for it and then over to the next closest attraction on your list.  Hopefully it will still only be a 5 - 15 minute wait and you can ride this and possibly still go onto the next ride on your list all within the first hour.Pay close attention to the time on your fastpass ticket that tells you when you can get a second fastpass for another ride.  If this time is BEFORE the return time of your first fastpass get your second fastpass BEFORE returning to your first fastpass ride. Try not to get distracted in this first hour.  Pay no attention to any shops or characters that are there to divert your attention.  It is vital you get your big four done first up.  Then you can relax somewhat for the rest of the day.Pack some snacks that will help you all until meal breaks.  Consider having meal breaks a little bit earlier or later than normal.  For lunch consider 11am over 12 noon, or 4.30pm instead of 6.30pm.Rides such as ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs A Small World‚Äô, ‚ÄòCastle Carousel‚Äô and ‚ÄòPirates of the Caribbean‚Äô appear to have fairly small wait times so I advise you to add these to your list later in the day. It helps give more bang for your buck."
333,5,19-Mar,N/A,I had to do an ansiment on this in school and it was SOOOOOOOO  COOOOOOOOL,It looks so cool and now i want to go i have to do this is an asiment in school for japanese i loved this place it was so intresting.
334,1,19-Mar,N/A,Inconsiderate disney staff,"Queueing for the Magic lives on show. Wife bringing child to toilet. Due to limited seat, staff disallowed me to reserve for them. That's fine. When wife arrives with child after toilet break (super long Q as i doubt TDR controlled the no. of visitors even they declared so), my wife was told the capacity is full and disallowed to enter. That's fine. I asked the staff to let my child sit on my lap without disturbing anyone with wife waiting outside. Again was rejected. Seeing the disappointment of my child, i asked the staff and manager tolet my child enter by herself. Again, rejected as my 6yo child is not meeting age requirement. Then, i suggested my child stand from the back to see the show, within leaving our sight. Again,TDR staff said so sorry... End up my whole family left with extreme disappointment with none wacthing the show even we have 1 seat. This was our 2nd day here but didnt even managed to see the show after 4th try. A terrible place with inconsiderate TDR staff. I highly recommend Hong Kong Disneyland over Tokyo. Will never visit TDR again. For those who think of coming, think twice unless you prepare to queue more than 1 hour for each rides or show."
335,5,18-Oct,United States,One of the best Park in city.,"TD Parks are really amazing, Tokyo Disney land and Tokyo Disney Sea are state of art resorts, always very busy. Great values if visit in evenings. Star light Passport is great for price. There are lot of discount packages if bought out side with hotel or train tickets. There are Restaurent‚Äôs and food is very expensive and always too many people. Please keep water and some quick foods if visiting with kids. Very clean park, may be number one in world Disney resorts."
336,2,19-Mar,Australia,Family day trip to Disneyland,"We came from Australia for a family day trip to Tokyo Disneyland, it was something our children (3 over 18) we decided to do the top 8 rides before getting there however the queues were up to 3 hrs. On the plus side there were clocks at each ride to tell you waiting times.  We managed to do 4 rides before deciding enough was enough for us, I have no idea how little children would fare.  It is Japan thou so no one was grumpy.We would not bother with this trip againhowever we noted during the time we were waiting that there. Is a fast pass available which we don‚Äôt know the cost of but those going through using those passes jumped the queues by at least a couple of hours. There should be info available to googleAlso crowds were huge so it would be well worth finding out when their school holds are as numbers may be bigger"
337,5,19-Mar,Singapore,A place where dreams do come true.,"Had a whole lot of fun here with my family. The rides were all family friendly which allowed everyone to enjoy it at the same time. Try all the different kind of churros there, they could really surprise your tastebuds. Get your fastpass as quickly as you can so you could enjoy and stroll through the park for the whole day."
338,3,18-Nov,Malaysia,Crowded as always,After 4 years visited Disneyland again but this round with young kid at 11months old. Baby friendly toilet and a lot of rides also suitable for young kids.
339,3,19-Mar,United States,Longest waiting time was 3 hours. ,"If you have whole day free time, the place will be good for you.  As you know, you need to research the place ahead of time from their website.  I would love to share efficient way to visit there.  First of all, please buy ticket from the online.  Discount ticket only can purchase from the Website, please do not order ticket from website after you arrive in Japan.  The company does not accept foreigners credit card on their website.  So you need order your ticket before you depart your country.  Depend on the situation, you can not purchase their ticket at the box office in TDL.  Second, as much as you can, please get Fast pass.  You do not need wait more than 20 minutes.  Third, food sections also have long line, waiting time average 30 minutes to order.  Please eat big breakfast and then visit there will be good for you.  They are not allowed to bring your personal foods.  All those reasons, I will purchase fast pass package ticket next time.  I hope you can enjoy with your friends and family.  30 minutes by car from Tokyo station.  "
340,1,19-Mar,Australia,Terrible,"150 minute waits for rides, bad hot dogs and about 10,000 people more than the place could handle. The fast pass system is a joke, we only managed to reserve one before the system closed for the day (they make you wait several hours before you can reserve another and the good rides book out quickly).The roller coasters are very tame but that makes them good for young kids. On the good side, the locals seem to love it and the place is spotlessly clean and feels very safe. My tip is to bring good shoes because you will be doing lots of standing."
341,5,19-Mar,N/A,Magical memories!,My kids love everything in Disneyland and it‚Äôs a very happy place! Weather was good to us. Services also excellent. 
342,4,19-Mar,Australia,First Disney Experience,"We went on the first Tuesday of March and it was busy. We went as a family of four with a 10month old in the pram and our 3 year old walking or sitting on dads shoulders when she needed a break. We did a bit of research in regards to fast passes and which rides we most wanted to go on before we went to Disneyland. We arrived 10mins before park opening and the lines were huge but don‚Äôt worry they move really quick, we were inside in about 5mins. My husband immediately went and collected a fastpass for the Winnie the Pooh ride and then we basically walked onto it‚Äôs a small world after all ride. This was a great ride, kids loved it. We all rode the Peter Pan ride (25min wait), baby included as well as the teacup ride (5min wait) and carousel ride (5min wait), skipped the dumbo ride which was a 35min wait which seemed excessive for the type of ride it was, although we did it the second day when it was raining a bit and wait time was only 5mins. Pooh was awesome and both kids loved it. Castle was fun to see inside, remember to use your flash when taking photos and some magic might happen. We did two days at Disneyland, which we needed and we still didn‚Äôt do everything. Adults favourite ride was Star Wars tour. Three year olds favourite ride was buzz lightyear Astro blasters which we did three times over two days. Monsters inc ride was also pretty good. The space mountain ride was very disappointing, don‚Äôt expect it to be very thrilling if you‚Äôre use to proper roller coasters. It was basically a very basic indoor roller coaster with flashy lights. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend wasting time going on this ride or wasting a fastpass on it like I did. Save your fast passes for monsters inc, buzz lightyear ride and Pooh ride especially if you‚Äôve got kids. There‚Äôs a play area in toon town for kids to run around in. Favourite food was mickeys glove sandwich with Chinese chicken on and the lightsaber churro. Make sure to use fast passes and download english TDR ride times on your phone it was very good for checking ride times and fastpass return times. We stayed in the resort area so we could get to parks early without having to travel and to also go back to hotel throughout day for kids to have a rest. We stayed at Sheraton which was great. Do not miss the nighttime parade and light show on the castle. The daytime parade was skippable if you don‚Äôt have time. The night parade was the best parade I‚Äôve ever seen in my life. For the best seats get there at least 45mins before parade starts and pick out your spot. There will be massive lines for the more popular rides so use fast passes wisely. We went on average crowd day for both days we went apparently and for us it was still pretty busy. We really enjoyed our experience at Disneyland overall."
343,5,19-Mar,Australia,"What can I say, it‚Äôs magical.","Been waiting years to visit Disneyland and I‚Äôve done the Tokyo Disneyland. It was busy and crowds were everywhere, but the Japanese know how to move crowds, the main attractions had the biggest crowds but within an hour you were on a ride, make sure you get fastpass on your favourite ride as you‚Äôll go straight into the ride, you can only get one at a time and have to use it first before you get another one. I loved the Star Tour and Space Mountain Rides, but the haunted mansion was good too.This place is magical and if your in Tokyo I would highly recommend it."
344,5,19-Mar,United States,Attention to Detail ,This park is NOT owed by the Walt Disney Company. It operates under a licensing agreement and it shows. This park is superior to all other Disney parks. Park is clean beyond any standard. The attention to details is everywhere. Expect BIG crowds everyday of the week. 
345,5,19-Mar,United States,What a magical place!!,"We spent the best part of a day (10am-8pm on a Monday) at Disneyland Tokyo. The queues weren‚Äôt as bad as expected (5-10min queue to get in) although the morning was a little rainy so may have put people off. The popular rides were longer waits (space mountain, roller coasters, log ride etc). In any case the rides notify you at line up the expected wait time so you can decide before joining the queue if you are up for the wait. The staff were everywhere and very helpful, happy & smiley. We watched the night time parade which was hands down the best parade we‚Äôve ever seen, worth securing a spot on the route for. Overall we all had a fab day, it felt like we were in a magical land removed from the real world. Oh and highly recommend the Jungle Cruise in Adventureland, unexpectedly awesome."
346,4,19-Feb,New Zealand,"Short on thrills, but great fun","Disney's not a high thrills type of theme park, with the rides definitely being on the tame side, but it does fun extremely well. It managed to make a pair of forty somethings feel like kids again with stylish rides and great shows. The queue times are an issue, making repeating popular rides like Space Mountain and Thunder Mountain impractical, but there's plenty to do still. The electric lights parade and the fireworks are a must see and we were lucky enough to catch the 35th anniversary show, which was amazing. The food available is okay and reasonably priced without being amazing and the park is incredibly clean. Would happily visit again. The only issue we had was our card not being accepted online so we had to buy a ticket on the day - Tokyo Disney, please sort out your payment portal as this was a real hassle."
347,5,19-Feb,Malaysia,Excellent ,"Hi and thx for reading again. Was here recently as 2A&2C(16&17 years old)Positive- much bigger than Hongkong - Mickey Disney character shaped ice cream- Much better crowd controlled for the nightly fire works display, march pass & shows- get to visit and go up the Disney tower - water dispensers sparsely located near outdoor activity lines - FREE fast pass located at entrance of some activity - many retail stores for die hard souvenir fans with views of actual glass shaped makers - allowed us to bring in water bottle & middle sized knapsack full of food & chips though we were searched at the entrance. Don‚Äôt know if we were lucky as their website says one ‚ÄúMAY‚Äù not. üòÖ- activity brochures are in many languages & even Bahasa M‚Äôsia- many come mildly dressed & yes even adults in their favorite characters Negative- directions & explanations are in Japanese mostly though a couple have English; no fault of theirs as the park crowd are mainly the locals. - can‚Äôt finish everything in a day if one doesn‚Äôt arrive earlyConclusion Will return as there‚Äôs a new section opening next year. "
348,4,19-Mar,Malaysia,Nice day at Disneyland ,"We spent the day at Disneyland and had a nice day with the kids.  This place is nice for younger kids maybe 3 to 12 years old. Not too many exciting rides for teenager.Clean environment and interesting shops, restaurants and rides. Queue can be long for some rides.We especially liked the parades. There is a parade during the day and a night time parade which is really colourful. Try and catch both the parades as well as the fireworks at the end of the night.  One thing which we found strange was that the fireworks should have come immediately after the night parade. But instead, we had to wait another half hour to see the short fireworks display.It was a little too cold for some of us as it was winter. Probably better to come during better weather like spring or autumn. "
349,4,19-Mar,N/A,purchase ticket,I would like to purchase my ticket via online and printed at home. Because i am travel with children and it seems cheaper.Do i need to change my ticket when i enter into park? I am travel total 8 person with children
350,5,18-Aug,N/A,A Good Day at Tokyo Disney,"Tokyo Disneyland is one of the most impressive disneyland parks Ihave ever visited.It is the only Disney Ocean Park in the world.It has reached the highest level of comfort of park area,entertainment items and number of people.Tokyo Disneyland is currentlythe most popular Disneyland.There are very few people,so the waiting time for each   other is very short.By contrast,Hong Kong's area is too small.There are too many people in Shanghai's and there are too few people in Paris's.Tokyo Disney is quiet and beautiful,staying there for a nenight is also recommended.You can go to Disney Ooean Park the next day.The whole Tokyo Disneyland resort is very mature.The environment is also very good.There are many hotels and you can go there by trains or buses.So the transportation is very convient."
351,5,19-Feb,Japan,Magical,"Even on rainy days with thousands of school kids out on break this place does not disappoint. Went for one day - the parades were great, waited for rides but only 10 to 15 minutes. There should have been more characters walking about and Mickey's House had a 1.5 hour wait but the day was great for the whole family. We didn't eat in the park though."
352,5,18-Aug,N/A,Must Go!!!,"Day 2 in Japan,we went to Disneyland in Tokyo.It's very interesting,I played a variety of roller coasters.The roller coasters here seem to have entered into fairy tale woulds.I am amazed by them."
353,5,18-Dec,Singapore,Happiest place on earth,"All Disney theme parks makes everyone feel like kids again. Just being in the park makes one very happy already, though the queues may be super long! Enjoyed all the rides and shows, enjoyed just walking around.. the F&B outlets, and of course, the nice parades and light shows..."
354,4,19-Feb,N/A,Must Go!!!,Disneyland is a must if you have never been there1. lots of restaurants with a variety of food (Can be pricey)2. The rides are very kid friendly. 3. The Parade.however bear in mind that the popular rides does have a massive queue time. e.g the roller coaster & haunted house is approx 1hr minimum wait.Overall definitely go if you have never been. It is breathtaking the first time around
355,5,19-Feb,Australia,What a great day,"Wonderful staff compliment all the amazing attractions.  Although very little English, this didn't diminish from a wonderful (& long) day."
356,3,19-Feb,Australia,little one had fun but hate fast pass,"I should more learn abt fast pass before I go. if you know abt fast pass very well, you will enjoy more if you don't, this fast pass will drag you to hell. I think maybe it is better that Disney get rid of fast pass. due to this pass, 1 hour waiting can be 2 hour or may 3 hours which will see take u into the hell. please educate yourself with this info before you go yet my niece really enjoyed Disneyland so I am happy. it was my main reason to have a trip to Japan for this time.  Japan Disneyland was all right buy if you are really up for Disney, of course I do recommend US. :) "
357,3,19-Feb,Australia,"Fun day, but be prepared to wait!","We went on a weekday and it was still quite busy, there were lines for everything, including the street food vendors. There are no fast passes you can buy, only tickets that allow you to come back at a certain window (which can be 3 or 4 hours after you get the ticket). We waited 100 mins for Space Mountain which is considered a fair waiting time. If you are interested in Disney but not set on the traditional Disneyland, I recommend DisneySea which is just next door. We were able to do a lot more rides there, and it‚Äôs a really cool park with lots to see!"
358,5,19-Feb,India,Lovely place for young kids,"Tokyo Disneyland  fairy tales, some rides , Disney characters, day long fun for family , elders do live there chilhood memories, shops and evening parade was excellent after sunset the laser and fireworks, must visit when in Tokyo ... take a train from Tokyo station to Mahimama station on JR line  very convenient"
359,5,19-Jan,Australia,A big day out but a great day out,"We visited Disneyland in early January (during the holiday week) and started out with a group,of 13 - 7 of us big kids at heart and 6 little excited kids aged 4 to 8 years. The visit included a very early morning train up to Tokyo, change train to subway about 1.5 hrs total ( and return at days end). It was a fantastic day, we all had the best time. Kids beside themselves with excitement and the thrill. I purchased the tickets within Japan ( I am a non Japanese speaking nonna) and I used a machine at our local Chigasaki 7 eleven,  with a little in store help. Absolutely no problem. We availed ourselves of the Fast Pass System for rides etc when possible, it saves queuing....Plenty of food and drink and bathroom options everywhere. One day is probably not enough time, but we did our best to see and do, keeping in mind our little fellow travelers. Our train journey home we used the Green Car option on JR as sure to get a seat for the kids, and can eat and drink...we bought snacks at Tokyo Station for trip home. Such a fantastic fun day the grandees (and our own kids) will remember- doing Disney with all your cousins. Priceless."
360,5,19-Jan,New Zealand,Crazy Busy,"Busy throughout the year like most Disney Parks. As a tall guy I did find it a struggle to get into some of the rides but I was able to fit them all (I'm 6' 4""). The trick I found was to cross my legs and move feet as far back as I could before sitting down. Indian Jones was no problem but them kept pulling me out of the line to measure my height. This turned out to be a good thing, as each time they did it and were happy I got to jump 1/3 of the line and my wife and daughter got to come too. On Hyperspace mountain avoid the front row of each card, again the staff will likely call this out to you when you join the line.We knew very little Japanese, they knew very little English, but everything just worked."
361,4,19-Mar,Japan,Family is everything ,Enjoy with family spend time in Tokyo Disneyland u will forget what time and kids don‚Äôt want back home 
362,4,19-Mar,Malaysia,Clean & fun. Plan your fastpass,Happiest place for kids. Well maintained parked. Trash bins everywhere. You will need at least 1-2 days to complete all the rides.Drawbacks:1. Fastpass finishes quickly. Do your research and pickup the fastpass immediately upon entry. I recommend picking up Winnie the Pooh's fastpass. It's the most popular ride in the park.2. Only 2 designated smoking areas. Adding 2 more will be more convenient for me. 
363,4,18-Dec,Philippines,amazing,planning is essential especially this is one of the busiest DL in the world. We all had a great time. maximize the use of fast pass. The food choices are limited compared to HK DL. But the total experience is very good.
364,5,19-Feb,N/A,We had fun for slightly more than two days here.,"We bought the vacation package which includes a certain amount of fast passes. Therefore, we need not join the public to queue for certain time slot‚Äôs fast passes for those popular rides. My girl‚Äôs current height is more suitable for Disneyland, in comparison to DisneySea.She is very happy that she is guaranteed entry (as she is a guest at the Disney hotels) even on crowded days, also the fact that the fast passes we had can be used at any time slot (during the operation timing of the park) and skipped the long waiting time (we still need to wait but much much faster than those who do not have fast passes...for example, the normal waiting time for those without fast passes will be 90mins while we only waited about 15mins).We bought lots of popcorn holders (different themes) and tasted at least 3 different flavours out of the available flavours.I purposely arranged this trip to tap on the 35th anniversary before it ends on mid March this year but the popcorn holder (Mickey Mouse with the 35th anniversary symbol) was sold out. But well, i managed to get the other ornament item which strongly signifies this anniversary, so I am still contented.I personally strongly encourage families with young children to consider purchasing the vacation package (no such package for Hong Kong Disneyland which we went in October 2016), as it brings lots of convenience despite that my husband and I do not understand Japanese and speak extremely limited Japanese. "
365,5,19-Feb,Singapore,Our first Disney experience,"Everything was great, it's so big that throughout the day we hardly covered 50% of iy. customer service was good, even though they don't speak English well, they were always there to help out. Very positive atmosphere. The Haunted House is the best!"
366,3,19-Feb,Australia,The happiest place for queues,"We arrived shortly after 9am by train and after making our way to the park, we‚Äôre immediately met by queues. Each ride was a minimum 50-80 min wait, meaning with lunch and shopping, we were able to do 6 rides before leaving at 7:30pm.If you‚Äôre wanting to see it all, you‚Äôll definitely want to buy a multi-day pass. Overall wasn‚Äôt a terrible day, but I wish we had more time to see everything...there‚Äôs always next time!"
367,3,18-May,N/A,Crowds,"I will start off by saying we did enjoy our time, however the fact that the fast passes can be booked within the first 30 min of the park opening and items being sold out within a couple hours is something we did not enjoy. This is an example of the mindset of people at the park when we went. But the part that saddened us the most what when I asked a cast member what the new wait time was for the line since the posted time was not at the end of the actual line, she looked at me as if we were bothering her and then walked away."
368,5,19-Feb,United States,Loved it!!! From a California Disneyland Purist,"I'm a huge Disney fan and I've been to the original Disneyland in California at least a dozen times over the years (plus Disney World once). I wasn't sure what to expect with my first visit to a international Disney park, but Tokyo Disney exceeded all of my expectations. To summarize: Tokyo Disney is incredibly detailed, has great unique rides only found in Japan, has much better food than the American parks, and the staff was friendly and amazing. Tokyo Disney does a great job of capturing the magic found in the original Disneyland.Hints for first time visitors:Tokyo Disney has great (only found in Japan) rides like Pooh's Honey Hunt and Monsters Inc, plus a new Beauty and the Beast Ride opening in 2020 that looks amazing! They also have most of the famous Disney rides found in other parks: Pirates of the Caribbean, Splash Mountain, Space Mountain, the Haunted House, Its a Small World, Peter Pan, Roger Rabbit, Star Tours, Jungle Cruise, Buzz Lightyear, Etc.Make sure to utilize fastpass tickets to avoid long lines. The park is very popular, and can get crazy busy, so avoid holidays, weekends, and try to go on a weekday.Pirates of the Caribbean isn't very popular in Japan, and normally has a 5-10 minute wait. Still a great ride. Buy your tickets online beforehand to skip the line.Try the food: It is so much better than the food in the American Parks. They have crazy flavors of popcorn (like Curry), teriyaki chicken legs, seafood pizza, good ramen, and countless crazy desserts.Disney Sea is a separate park located across the street, you need a separate admission ticket to enter it. It has the awesome Indiana Jones ride, Tower of Terror, Toy Story Mania and other fun rides. Their is no hopper pass to run back and forth between the parks like in California.My only criticisms: Their Tomorrowland had a very dated feel to it, it did contain all the great rides (Space Mountain, Star Wars, Buzz Lightyear). But it just felt weak in details compared to the rest of the park.Also, their Adventure Land only contained 2 rides, and didn't contain The Indiana Jones ride (they do have Indiana Jones at Disney Sea across the street), which left only the train and the Jungle Cruise. Adventure Land could really use a big E-ticket attraction.Highly recommend a visit for any Disney fans."
369,5,19-Feb,Qatar,The happiest place,You will have the best day ever. Just put in your mind that everything inside is in Japanese language but you will enjoy every moment.
370,4,18-Dec,Australia,Amazing place,A lot of fun. Interesting for all ages. We spent all day there from morning until closing and couldn't see everything. A lit thing to see. But one minus: too many people
371,4,19-Feb,Australia,Hectic but Fun,"Our 2nd DL after Paris. Our kids are 10 & 8 and I think next time we will visit Disney Sea as the rides in DL I think are more geared up towards younger kids. We spent 100mins queuing for both Space Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain which really eats into your day, but these were the two most ""exciting"" rides available that day in the Park. We managed to get a Fast Pass for Pooh's Hunny Hunt so we saved 60mins there.Top tip is that I would recommend that you buy your tickets BEFORE you arrive at the Park, otherwise you'll be double queuing (once for tickets and then once to get in).We stayed in Odaiba which wasn't too far away and had good attractions / shopping / food for the kids.  What I didn't know and the really helped was finding out that LAWSONS or FAMILY MART (convenience stores - you'll find them everywhere) sell Disneyland tickets (there's a machine near the door, I just asked the staff member to help me buy tickets).  This was awesome as it made buying the tickets super easy and convenient.Also we could take food and drinks into the Park. I'd heard you couldn't but this wasn't true."
372,5,19-Jan,Malaysia,Mickey Mouse and gang spoke and sang in Japanese!,"Our third Disneyland after Paris and Hong Kong. Definitely better than Hong Kong and Paris. Rides were newer and the crowd better. We didn't wait too long for most of the rides even without fast pass. Watched the parade and fireworks. So cool! Towards closing time, we even managed to go on one more ride. Only negative feedback: food and drinks were expensive. Don't remember if Paris and Hong Kong were as expensive as here."
373,4,18-Dec,Japan,Disney in Japanese,"We had a great time specially with Star Wars ride. We love it, it was a great way to spend a couple of days."
374,5,19-Feb,N/A,Amazing!,"We visited the park for one day whilst visiting Tokyo. I personally found the park, the attractions and the food so much better than Disney Hong Kong and Disney Shanghai. For me, Disney Tokyo is on par with Disney in Paris. Picking up our tickets was a strange experience, we collected them in the airport on our arrival before going to disneyland the next day! If visiting please be mindful of this as European guests who have been to Paris might think you collect your pre-paid tickets from Disneyland on the day you visit. Very enjoyable experience, although it was very cold and wet at times in February. Please wrap up warm is visiting in winter, also strong, waterproof, comfy footwear is a must! A lot of walking will be done if you want to see everything. Also prepare for a very long day, we left our Tokyo hotel at 5am and got hone at midnight! The subway us quite easy to work out so no taxi required. The park was very busy which reflected its popularity. All the staff were very kind and helpful. I think this was the cleanest themepark I have ever visited! The shops are great, be sure to leave enough time to check them out. There is a disney village type place nearby however there is nothing disney there, apart from the largest Disney store in Tokyo I believe (which I found to be quite average-sized and chaotic), I would actually avoid! I would definitely visit again if staying in Tokyo."
375,5,19-Jan,Malaysia,Enjoyed this better than DisneySea even though it rained!,"In all honesty, I prefer Disneyland than DisneySea. Due to big part of the crowds. DL crowds are not too bad, and most rides only had 20-30minutes wait vs DS 90-120 mins wait. Also, their parades and fireworks are amazing. With DS, the fireworks are hidden behind a few building!"
376,5,18-Nov,N/A,Tons of things to enjoy,"Very similar to Disneyland in Anaheim except it's a lot more spacious and much cleaner, with more shops. You'll really like the extra square footage because there will be tons of people when you arrive.Took my family to see this. Although, things are a bit expensive the experience was fantastic. What an experience."
377,5,19-Feb,Japan,One of the best Disney Parks!,"I have had the pleasure of visiting 4 of the 6 Disney Theme Parks worldwide and I have to say that Tokyo Disneyland is absolutely one of the best. It captures the magic of the original Disneyland in Anaheim, while boasting the size and grandeur of Disney World in Orlando! The Cast Members here are also extraordinarily friendly and a joy to be around. The shows are absolutely incredible and the atmosphere gatherings are nothing to turn your nose up at! You absolutely have to try as much food from the stands around the park as you can (especially all the different flavors of popcorn and maybe a seasonal churro)! Also much more moderately priced than the parks in America. Definitely a must see if you enjoy Disney and are visiting Tokyo!"
378,5,18-Dec,Australia,A+ experience and one to remember! ,We visited Tokyo Disneyland one day after we visited Tokyo DisneySea and our daughters loved Disneyland a bit more as there were more rides that they liked üíï The lines were fairly long for the rides but they were worth it as the rides had heaps of detail and were ‚Äúsuper fun‚Äù Some of the rides to remember to ride are the haunted house  üèö 
379,4,18-Nov,Japan,It's A Small World is Back!,"After a long time of closure due to rennovation, ""It's A Small World"" is back! It has new additions of figures from famous cartoons."
380,4,19-Jan,N/A,Quick visit after XX years,It has been couple of years since we visited Tokyo Disneyland. The experience is good as same same last time and even better since this year is 35th anniversary. They got lots of special event going on. Although there are lots of people and we eventually need to wait almost over at least 45 mins for game but still worth it. As you can experience the Japanese style of line up. It is a very different experience compare to HK Disneyland. There are some expansion going on and i guess get prepare for the 2020 Olympics. Surely will go back sometime soon.  
381,5,19-Jan,N/A,Loved it!,"We had a great time here! Bought a three day pass that allowed entry to both Disneyland and Disneysea. After doing one day at each park we decided to come back to Disneyland.We were concerned that it would be too crowded having read the reviews. It was busy, but by using the fast passes we managed to ride everything we wanted without waiting in too many long lines. We visited on a Monday and Wednesday.There are rides for younger children and thrill seekers. Although Disney sea has more thrill seeker rides.Great Disney atmosphere, beautiful well kept park. Food is ok, reasonably priced compared to what you‚Äôd pay at parks in Australia.Loved it!"
382,5,18-Dec,Singapore,Experience the Disney Magic ,Skip the queue by getting your tickets online. Do plan out your route before heading there as the place is huge and requires quite a bit of walking. Disneyland has rides for young and for thrill seekers. Fast pass collection could run out by mid day. Do try food at different restaurants as the restaurants serve different ‚Äòsignature‚Äô food. 
383,5,18-Dec,Australia,V Chill Park,"Been to a number of Disney parks and this has to be my 2nd fave after the original Disneyland in Anaheim. Very chill park, can be very busy but everyone just patiently waits and is polite. Love the way everyone gets completely on board with matching hats and outfits- v cute. You'll need more that one day here. Stay for the night time electrical parade. "
384,4,19-Jan,Australia,Busy but enjoyable,We went on a wwek day to avoid too big a crowd. I don't think that worked. It was very crowded.  We waitied on average 30 to 40 minutes for rides. However once in it was worth the wait. There's lots to see and do and it's a kids paradise that adults will certainly enjoy. It's a Small World ride is a must. 
385,5,18-Oct,Canada,Great time,"Great time, for a Disneyland experience in Tokyo.I wasn't sure what to expect, with only gone to the one in Florida.The price for one day was roughly $80 American.  Which is less than what you would pay in Florida or California.  At least half the price, compared to the one in Florida.The park is setup beautifully but the park does get extremely busy.  But really no different than what I experienced when I was in Florida.  The announcements also go out in English as well, if anyone might be wondering.  You will also see people cosplaying as their favorite characters from Disney walking around.  And if you ask them, they will gladly take a photo with you.Disney does a bang up job on making everyone have a great experience.  Even in Japan.And I do mean everyone.  Even the staff that clean the park are very friendly, courteous, and very helpful.As I was lining up for the Space Mountain ride, one of the staff members who's English was pretty good, warned me about the seat height, and that I may have to scooch down a bit.  Which was very nice and helpful.  Since I stand at 6'-2"" (188cm).They had parades going through the park a few times a day and a couple at night.The night parade was beautiful.I'm glad I went there for the experience.  Disney, plus the staff didn't disappoint.If you like Disney and you were curious about checking it out, when you're in Tokyo, then I think it is well worth it."
386,5,18-Nov,N/A,Loved it,Similar enough to the California park to feel nostalgic about it. But different enough that it is worth a visit. I had such a good time. Also the things they sell are so different from the things at US Disneys
387,4,19-Jan,United Kingdom,Wonderful paradise but really too crowded,"Disneyland is a place where many miracles and magic moments happened. Tokyo Disneyland is quite easy to access as the metro has clear instructions and information signs. I went to the Disney on 1/1, which really too crowded to go, we had to queue for at least  2 hours for every game, thought they were worth to wait. The 35 anniversary celebrations and the new year celebrations were fantastic, really enjoyed the paradise and the music show. ü•≥I definitely will visit again, but will choose a day which is not a public holiday üòÇ"
388,5,18-Dec,Australia,Tokyo Disneyland & Disneyland Sea,"Always a great place to visit with young children. The fastpass is always worth getting, particularly for very popular rides like Toy Story at Disneyland Sea. If only visiting one park, we‚Äôd recommend choosing Disneyland Sea. The food and souvenirs are reasonably priced and of good quality. The various flavoured popcorns are worth trying and the themed popcorn buckets are a hit with the kids. The locals love to dress up at Disneyland which is a wonderful spectacle that adds to the atmosphere of Tokyo Disneyland. Higly recommended particularly for families for young children."
389,5,18-Dec,N/A,Smaller version of Disneyland Anaheim,"Basically a smaller version of Disneyland in Anaheim. Went mid-December and the park was not crowded at all. Able to ride everything we wanted with reasonable wait times for those rides we did not have a FastPass for.If you enjoy Disneyland, you will enjoy Tokyo Disneyland."
390,5,19-Jan,Indonesia,Great theme park,"Disneyland never failed. It was great to be there. Every disney park has its own theme. when i visit there on january, its quite empty, the queue was not take so long. The parade and the lighting show so great. My kids really love their visit here."
391,4,18-Oct,Australia,Disney fans and family fun,"If you are a big Disney fan and really invested in all the characters and films then Disneyland Tokyo is for you! Full of amazing attractions and rides, and fun for the whole family. Be prepared for an expensive day out with all the food stalls and carts being quite costly. I highly recommend the churros and pork legs as well as a visit to the Queen of Hearts Cafe."
392,5,18-Jul,Australia,Another Disney experience!,"We bought an ""after 6 passport"" and spent a lovely night racing around to all the major rides in Disneyland. We went back the following day with a day pass to enjoy the remainder of the park. Having been to Tokyo Disneyland approximately 20 years ago, I knew it wasn't as big as Anaheim (which we visited 6 years ago), but it was still a great experience. I do feel it lacked a little of that Disney ""magic"". Maybe it was because the characters were not roaming. Having said that, we did visit during the July heatwave, so that is understandable. It was a great day with the family, but our family (2 adults and 2 teens) enjoyed Disney Sea more. "
393,3,19-Jan,N/A,Disappointing,"I'm not sure if I'd have liked it more if it was my first experience, but having been to the one in Paris several times, this comes nowhere near the Paris experience, I expected more and this one definitely isn't worth the price and waiting time to get in, very over prices and poor value for money."
394,4,18-Dec,Australia,Great park,"Compare to Hong Kong, this park is much better, less crowded, people are more organised, and friendly. My both of my sons,  8 years old and 2 years old enjoyed it very much.Perhaps it is best to take one kid each and split up because most rides has height restriction."
395,5,19-Jan,Japan,"Great fun, memorable break!","Excellent place to enjoy with children. We went on the last 2 days of the Japanese school winter break, and were lucky not to have to queue too long (fewer people).We managed to get Fastpasses for popular rides, which further reduced queuing time. An added plus is that Japan being Japan, every corner of the park was extremely well maintained."
396,3,18-Dec,United States,Really crowded and the rides are better at Disneysea,"We've visited Disneysea the past 2 years but haven't been to Tokyo Disneyland in about 18 years, so it would be our younger son's first time there. All the advice I've read said to be there early so we arrived about 7:15 for the 8:00am opening. There must have been at least 40 people in front of us in one of the shorter lines to the entrance! People do get up super early to stand in line at Disneyland!Our first stop when the park opened (no announcement or rope drop here!) was the fast pass for Monsters Inc ride, which I think is only at this Disneyland. By the time we got there, it was already the 11:15 fast pass. Then we went to Space Mountain and the line there was 1/2 hr. One thing to note about Space Mountain at this Disneyland, there is NO music on the ride! It was so disappointing since that is one of my favorite parts of this ride. After Space Mountain, we went to Pirates ride (same as the US version) which had a 10 minute wait, the Star Tours ride (different endings like the US Disneyland) - 10 minute wait, and Haunted Mansion (It was the Night before Christmas version) - 1/2 hr wait. We also got a Big Thunder fast pass for 1:00pm.Monster's Inc ride was okay. The ride is built like the Buzz Lightyear ride and instead of shooting targets, you shine flashlights at targets. But there is no score so after a little bit, it got sort of boring. Maybe it's fun for little kids, but the lines here are the longest in the park so I don't think it's worth lining up for more than once. It's better if you have a fast pass but those run out quite early.Lunch was at Plasma Ray's since it was one of the few places that offered vegetarian food. The vegetable curry we got was decent and the prices were ok for Disney. We also picked up a Darth Vader popcorn bucket and got a coupon for popcorn at another popcorn stand (corn potage popcorn did not sound appetizing but was popular).Before Big Thunder fast pass was good, we also got a fast pass for It's a Small World ride. That was a big surprise since that ride usually doesn't have much of a line anywhere else in the world. The standby line was over 1/2 hr so we used the fast pass thinking maybe it's different from other It's a Small World rides. No, it's the same, just with a long line!We were at Disneyland on Dec 31st so it closed at 5pm to get ready for their New Year's Eve event. We think it wasn't very crowded that day (max line was about 70 minutes when it could go up to 140 minutes on popular days) but it still felt crowded. Unfortunately, when we tried to use our fast pass for Big Thunder, it was temporarily closed so we decided to leave the park. On the way out, we saw the parade. Nice parade but nothing memorable. Of the 2 Tokyo Disney parks, I have to say that Disneysea is much more fun and different than Disneyland. That's the one we would return to."
397,5,19-Jan,Indonesia,Nice Vacation,"Spending one day in this Tokyo Disneyland with some of the rides using Fast Pass was an absolutely fun !! We pick some rides that can be enjoyed by my son (6) : Peter Pan Flight, Star Wars Tour, Monster Inc, Space Mountain, Pooh, Snow White, Dumbo üòÅüëçü•≥ and was closed by Evening Show in the famous castle üëçü•≥"
398,5,18-Dec,Malaysia,Simply outstanding,"An amazing place to have fun, thrills or just relaxing and enjoying quality time with kids. Super clean atmosphere and fantastic staff who go out of their way to help you. I hope to return one day."
399,5,18-Nov,Philippines,Love it.... But crowded,"It's our 2nd time at Tokyo Disney, it's a lot more crowded compared to our visit last summer, minimum of 30min waiting time for the rides. The Christmas parade is awesome, very entertaining. "
400,5,18-Jun,Singapore,Best Disneyland,"Tokyo disneyland has so far been the best disney park visited.  Although there is language barrier, they are always willing to help to solve your problems. The waiting queue is also systematic and good.  Safe to walk around even until the park close. Food is a bit expensive but that is all about theme park food prices.  Wonderful magical experience.  Suitable for family to play and also exciting rides for the adventurous."
401,5,18-Dec,United States,Night in Tokyo Disney ,"I got a chance to visit Tokyo Disney, for only $37!! That‚Äôs right! After 6pm Tokyo Disney and DisneySea tickets go from regular admission price of $67 to half the price! During December they have amazing Christmas decor! I got to experience the Stitch Encounter,(Japanese ONLY) but still worth it! I didn‚Äôt understand what stitch was saying, but the simple fact that everyone else was laughing made this experience more fun! I laughed with everyone else, and thankfully I didn‚Äôt get selected to answer some of his silly questions! I ended my trip to Tokyo Disney with bags and bags of Disney goodies for my loved ones! Highly recommend a visit to both parks! "
402,4,19-Jan,United States,Day trip to Disneyland ,"Visited with a one-day pass.Plus:  able to reserve/purchase tickets at 7-11. This is a MUST, really long lines at ticket booths on the day of. Save yourself an hour waiting in the cold/heat. Fast Passes available for two of our ‚Äúhigh priority‚Äù rides. Nice covered Main Street. The famous Disney ambiance, right down to the spotless streets and Cast Members at every corner. Interestingly, there wasn‚Äôt a gift shop at the end of each major ride (like Anaheim), which was refreshing.Minuses:  super crowded! Don‚Äôt go during school vacations or you will wait at least an hour for every ride. Most popular rides had 150-180 minute waits. Most Fast Passes ran out by noon and shut down, so we only got 2 Fast Pass rides. Restaurants ditto, 20-80 minutes wait esp during meal times. Go during off-meal times. Download or get a map, layout is not very intuitive. Have fun!"
403,5,19-Jan,Singapore,The happiest place on earth,"Went on 4th Jan, was less crowded and enjoyed ourselves with our 2 year old for a full day. The resort makes it a point to habe non stoo entertainment and the service team is forever smiles. Love the vibe and we will be back!"
404,1,19-Jan,Philippines,Worst Disneyland Experience Ever!,"This is the worst Disneyland experience ever! The place is so crowded and there is a very long queue in every attraction; you have to wait at least an hour or so to see/ride one!!! Even the comfort rooms, restaurants, and shops have very long queues!!Definitely will not be coming back! "
405,3,18-Dec,Singapore,Crowd-iest Disneyland on Earth,"Have visited Disneyland Orlando, Anaheim and Hong Kong. I must say Tokyo Disneyland is the most crowded among those I have visited. I have read that Disneyland Tokyo can be very crowded; I bought a 3-day pass, look-up the crowd calendar and chose to visit from Tuesday to Thursday with the least crowd. But still, it is very crowded for all 3 days. I can't imagine if its a weekend.Tokyo Disneyland's character meeting & photo-taking is somehow different from other countries. Unless you are going to the ""official & proper"" character meet & greet located at their shack , the ""ad-hoc"" characters that pops up in the street doesn't have a proper queue. We see people crowding around the character and after a few times, we observed that there is no queue because the character picks the person to take picture with. So yah... wait for your turn to be picked. If you have kids, they will surely take a picture with you in no-time. All you need to do is call and wave at the character. Tokyo Disneyland has many strict rules to abide as well. While waiting for the night parade, we opened up our foldable director chair in one corner where there is nobody behind us, the disney staff came over and say no and asked us to keep it. On 2nd occasion, my 9yo gal who is not tall was asked by the disney staff to come down from the bench that she was standing while my gal was stretching her neck trying to catch a glimpse of the light show at Cinderella Castle with all the tall adults in front of her. *rolls eyes*If you have been to other Disneyland before and have limited time for theme parks, just go for Disneysea which can only be found in Tokyo."
406,3,18-Dec,Australia,Disneyland packed,We are Disney buffs and have visited the original Disneyland a couple of times at peak times near Christmas.We visited Disneyland Tokyo at the end of this December. We have mixed feelings. We definitely prefer the Disneyland at Anaheim due to the layout and atmosphere. What shocked us was the crowds. It was insane! Rides were nearly a 3 hour wait. We lined up for fast passes in between the rides we could get on ( not many) there are a variety of food choices and shows. We also went when it was freezing. So be prepared to line up in 6 degrees for an hour minimum. Due to the crowds we did not stay for the fireworks.If you are going to shop do it when a parade is on or midday NOT at night as you cannot move. It was clean and the staff were polite. Do not expect the staff to be able to speak English which really isn‚Äôt needed as there a plenty of signs in English.We can tick this Disneyland off. We enjoyed DisneySea better. We have Two teenagers. Disneyland is more suited for younger children.Try the different flavoured popcorns to eat while waiting in lines.
407,5,18-Dec,Japan,My First Disney Ever!,This was the first time I‚Äôve ever been to any Disney park and I can‚Äôt wait to go back! The only thing I noticed was the characters that walked around seemed to avoid American children. I tried to get a picture with my girls and they just walked away.
408,4,18-Dec,Philippines,Always merry and lively,Still the happiest place on earth. But always with lots of visitors so expect long lines and be patient. Or make use of the fast pass.
409,3,19-Jan,Australia,Tokyo Disneyland - The busiest place on Earth,Came here for my daughter‚Äôs 5th birthday.We arrived about 1pm and surprised at how short the queue to enter at the front gate was (that was the shortest queue of the day!).When we arrived I noticed a couple of Disney characters there for photo opportunities - but we were keen to move on so didn‚Äôt stop. Bad move as we never saw any more the whole day (which disappointed my daughter).Tokyo Disneyland crowds are like NYE everywhere. Even the toilet queue was long.We heard about the Fast Pass option but unfortunately by the time we got there they were all sold out.We only ended up queuing for a few rides which took 40 minutes each (and lots of patience with little ones). Other rides such as It‚Äôs A Small World said their queue was close to 100 minutes.We went on Pirates of the Caribbean - and unfortunately the ride hasn‚Äôt changed much since I went to Disneyland 30 years ago.It‚Äôs a very expensive day out (especially with all the shops that you pass by and end up after every rude). And by the end the kids were tired and grumpy.In saying that - the kids still had a ball and have fond memories.Also a tip - if you are celebrating a birthday tell the staff and you‚Äôll get a birthday sticker so everyone will say Happy Birthday to you - which made my daughters day.
410,5,19-Jan,N/A,A very special people are here:),This is the best Disneyland I have ever visited! The shows and the parades are superior. They include a lot of characters. A unique point in Disneyland is that you can inside the castle through Cinderella‚Äôs Fairy Tale Hall. It showcases Cinderella‚Äôs story. And I forgot my iphone x inside the toilet but luckily one of the disney staff return back to me.
411,3,18-Dec,Canada,"A very busy, cold day",While I realise we went during the week between xmas and New Years we arrived at the park at 8am and already the lines were 40 min plus long.  We got fast passes for splash mountain right away and got a time of 11:30am.  The next time we could get a fast pass was at 10:30m and we got a ride time of 3:30pm.   There were so many people and the lines were so long for everything the kids really didn't have that great of a time.  The staff was all very pleasant and happy but the lines were just too much.  Probably wouldn't go back 
412,1,18-Dec,United Kingdom,Worst theme park experience ever!,"I know that we must have chosen one of the busiest days to go to Disneyland - Saturday over the December holidays -  we arrived at about 10am and it was already incredibly busy. The fast pass tickets for rides we coming in with return times for late afternoon / evening! The standby times on rides we at 90mins minimum and some up to 130mins.I felt terrible for my kids as I knew they would not get on many rides and would become impatient in the queues.By the end of he day we had gone on 2 rides and 1 simulator. We had to queue for everything - food lines, restaurants, popcorn, EVERYTHING was a wait.It is by far the worst experience at a theme park I have had. There was clearly too many people there than they could accommodate.If you are going for the rides, don‚Äôt bother. If you are going for the Disney experience then the place is clean and well maintained and the Disney characters roam the park for photo opportunities (but you have to queue for these too). Disappointing for the kids. "
413,4,18-Dec,Japan,Disneyland one day ticket ,"Still fun and enjoyable. Went gefiele Christmas. One special anniversary parade in the day, one Christmas special parade in the day and one night parade as well as the fireworks. Thrill rides for adults would be splash mountain, space mountain, big thunder. Disneyland more kids friendly and if you are into rides then Disney sea have more to offer. Do try their food, it‚Äôs good and price reasonable considering it to be in a theme park. "
414,5,18-Jan,Singapore,Enjoyable time despite the crowd,"People were not kidding when they mention that Disneyland Tokyo is very crowded. The queue is always long but if we use the Fast Pass, it is not an issue. We went Disneyland Tokyo for 1 day and it was sufficient for us to cover all rides. However, we could not catch the shows and the parade. Partly because we went back to our hotel to eat because there was  no Halal food at Disneyland Tokyo. If we had not done that, we will be able to do more. As usual, the crowd was overwhelming at the parade. As such, we prefer to queue up for rides. Although the queue for the rides was long, it was constantly moving and even when we waited for an hour for some of the rides, the wait was surprisingly pleasant. Especially since we went during the cool winter time and not during the hot and humid summer. I can't wait to go back to Disneyland. Not just to bring my kids back there again.. but also for myself üòÅ"
415,3,18-Dec,Singapore,Over-crowded,"To start off, the subway station did not have clear instruction how to get there.   We need to ask around, try to figure out which is the subway line and goggle for info.  I am not sure why as this is a major attraction.The attraction is filled with people on a cold winter day.   Most attractions have to queue for at least from 1.5 hours to 2.5 hours.  Standing in the freezing temperature is quite unbearable.  So you can imagine how many rides one can take a day.  It is over-crowded.On a positive note, the staff made the rides interesting with their enthusiasm.   The place has very high maintenance standard.  This is clearly shown despite millions of people visiting it.I would recommend visiting the place not in winter."
416,5,18-Dec,Singapore,üéâ DREAMING UP! üéä,"Being a Disney Otaku, Tokyo Disneyland may be one of the best Disney Parks in Asia or in some case, one of the best Disney Parks in the world. I can't get over how tall and enchanting Cinderella's Castle is during the day or night. Before March 2019, it will be fantastic to visit Tokyo Disneyland as there is its 35th Happiest Celebration going on. The decorations and constantly updated food menu, are splendid, especially World Bazaar Celebration Street. There is an enormous photo op for anyone to take pictures with all the mickey statues from all of the anniversaries up till the 35th. During the day, every 10 to 15 minutes, the theme song for the 35th anniversary will play. And at night, classic disney musical films from the Disney Renaissance era, such as the Lion King and the Little Mermaid will be played beautifully throughout World Bazaar.One tip is if you target the popular rides, really do grab fastpasses at the fastpass machines near each fastpass attraction. For us, we grabbed the Monsters Inc Ride fastpasses at Tomorrowland and ran to Fantasyland to standby the ride for Pooh's Hunny Hunt. The fastpass would save you queuing time and it was worth for the Monsters Inc Ride.Something that was spectacular was the limited-time only 'Dreaming Up' Parade. Waiting for about an hour to get a promising view of the parade was worth the time. You can rest and also purchase cute and detailed snacks from the famous Sweetheart Cafe at World Bazaar while waiting. I would recommend you to watch the parade before March 2019 and if you know or at least like Disney characters. The song was mixed beautifully with other Disney film music and the parade floats. It was so addictive that you can sing the song inside your head. For Disney fans out there, it may make you cry of nostalgia as I did."
417,5,18-Dec,Singapore,A place that lets you open your wallet with a smile!,"Childhood dream to visit Disneyland! We went on a Sun and the crowd wasn't as crazy as what we had thought. Crowds are mostly locals, surprising not many tourists on a Sun. A place that makes dream comes true! A pity that we didn't have time to take photo with any of the characters. Kind of sad thinking about it now. But we actually conquer quite a number of rides. The queue for the rides are quite manageable.All I could say was one day here is definitely not enough. Try to plan ahead by getting the fast pass to some of the rides as well as the lottery chance for the performance. F&B queue are definitely long and so we had to settle on something quick like a Mickey hand-shaped bun / giant turkey drumstick / snacking on popcorn from the Willy design bucket. Best ride which I enjoyed was definitely the roller coaster one.Basically a place that lets me open my wallet with a smile!"
418,5,18-Dec,Australia,Busy day but worth every penny! ,"My partner and I visited Tokyo Disneyland yesterday. Being that the new year is upcoming it was busy but we expected it no matter the time of year. We found it amazing from the moment we walked through the entrance gates. I‚Äôve read some reviews about complaints re: wait time for attractions... it‚Äôs Disneyland! You are going to need to wait, please don‚Äôt be surprised. My partner and I waited from 20-110minutes (most wait times about 30-45). Every attraction has a sign with expected wait time so you are pre warned. We did not ever have a wait time longer then what was on the sign, in fact most of them were quicker. Our most favourite attractions: Winnie The Poo, Thunder Mountain and It‚Äôs a Small World.There is food everywhere! We went to the Queen Of Hearts Banquet. You get a choice of what you put on your tray (Savoury and sweet) some of the sweets come with a cup and saucer to keep! It was very well priced as well. We spent from 9:30am-9pm there, make sure you stay for the fireworks (8:30pm) and try and watch a parade (usually after dark), you will see people sitting down waiting. Truly an amazing place and a must see! We only did one day and that was enough for us (we are incredibly officiant with time and do not like sitting down too long, so if you want to relax through your time there maybe do more than one day). "
419,5,18-Oct,Japan,Where DREAMS come true! A must go!,"Tokyo Disney is a theme park entirely based on the films produced by Walt Disney!Opened in 1983, the Japanese park had the privilege of being the first outside the United States.Today it is already the third most visited park in the world.In Japan there are two parks side by side: Tokyo Disney and Tokyo DisneySea!The first was done in the mold of Disneyland in California and the Magic Kingdom in Florida.Disney is divided into 7 worlds or theme lands.It goes from the western / western old style to the extreme future with Star Wars.From the drinking fountains, trash bins and warning signs.In a few minutes you will be totally immersed in the experience and surely you will spend a day that you will completely forget about the real world!"
420,5,18-Nov,N/A,Must visit,When you go to tokyo for a vacation then you shouldn't miss disneyland especially if you have children. Staff in disney were one of the best accomodating to visitors. The parade was breathtaking and also the fireworks. I love it so much despite the cold weather.
421,5,18-Dec,China,Busy Day,"Visited on Dec 18, there were lots of people even though it was a weekday. Make sure to get a fast pass at the Monsters Inc. ride and Space Mountain or else you'll have to wait for 90 mins. Lines in most rides are very long (60-90 min wait time) so Fast Pass and Single Rider are your best friends, make sure to make good use of them so you can enjoy all the rides in the park. Thunder Mountain Railroad is way better than Disneyland Hollywood. It's my favorite Disney ride ever and the one in Tokyo is at par with Hong Kong's, in my opinion. Classic rides such as Splash Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, Peter Pan, It's A Small World are a must. You can ride Jungle Cruise at night for a different feel. Star Tours have zero line so ride it anytime.They check the bags upon entry but didn't say anything when they saw the snacks we brought. Bring a water bottle too so you can refill them in the park."
422,4,18-Nov,Indonesia,must visit spot in Tokyo,"Going here with family during vacation in November 2018. The park is fully loaded, several attraction were not be able to play since the queuing is very long. Fast pass might possible however the queuing process it self required some process which might ended in the hour that may not suit with the schedule. However worth it to try and enjoy the park until night since so many attraction which very attractive. Suggest to enter the park early in the morning so that we can enjoy the park until night. "
423,4,18-Dec,Singapore,"Very crowded, but very interesting ","Tokyo Disney land, similar to other Disneylands, are suitable for younger kids, the queues are horrendously long for everything, from rides to restaurants to... pop corn stations! Yes your eyes are not playing trick on you, I wrote pop corn stations! And guess what? The longest queue isn‚Äôt for the rides, it‚Äôs for all the carts selling unique pop corn holders! Japanese has made such great merchandisers that every pop corn station has their own unique holders, where you cannot hope to get the same one again after you leave that particular stations.. so in the end, everybody queue! And awesome design and merchandise they have made indeed, you feel like buying the whole Disneyland home! Kid you not, this place is more for shopping than for rides... "
424,5,18-Dec,Singapore,The kids love it,"We managed to get into the rides even though there is a Q. Being first timer there, we didn‚Äôt do any homework nor bothered how express pass works, we managed to get on many rides with the kids. Weather is cold so do bring enough to keep warm."
425,4,18-Nov,Singapore,Better for little ones. ,"It rained almost the entire day which made waiting in long lines quite unpleasant. The long queues were everywhere. Can't believe even with Fast Pass, we waited like 5 hrs for a 3 min ride! I'm thinking it's the last theme park for me. Some of the rides were very good, like the Pirates of the Carribean and the classic It's a Small World. Would have gone for more rounds had it not been the long queues everywhere. "
426,5,18-Dec,N/A,MAGICAL,"After our very long day at Disneysea, we headed to Tokyo Disneyland the very next morning at 8am. And long lines were already formed when we arrived! We thought we arrived early but no! So we managed to enter the park at 8.30am.Went to get the first fastpass- Monsters ride before heading to the Star Tours (5 min wait). Then we went to Toontown for Gadget's Go Coaster (15 mins wait) and waited for 55 mins for a picture with Mickey. Seems stupid for the long wait but I'm so happy to be able to get a photo with him. Then, we headed to Fantasyland for It's A Small World (20 mins wait)- still my favourite after visiting HK's Small World in Disneyland. I went to check the waiting times for the rides through the app and noticed Small World's waiting time was rather short so i dont think there's no need to get the fast pass for Small World. Go get fast pass for Space/Splash mountain or Big Thunder Mountain.Food was rather average or downright bad.  Luckily we ate at 11am/11.30am- when we went out alot of people were waiting outside! Gosh! (and we also had difficulties finding an empty table)Took a stroll around Westernland next and went for Country Bear Theater but I almost fell asleep because I couldn't understand their language and what are they talking about- same goes to Disneysea but at least I understand the plot and songs) and all staff spoke in Japanese. I think English is also required because not only Japanese visit Disneyland- people from all over the world visit too. It would be best if they provide English Language as well.Managed to get a fast pass for Space Mountain and we went for the ride. I like how they had exits for those who decided not to ride the ride. Space Mountain was thrilling and fun.You can't miss Dreaming Up (parade) there because all your favourite characters will be appearing, transporting you back to your childhood dreams and memories.  I really love the parade and I hope you all will too. We rode the Monsters Ride after that.We queued for around 45 mins for the Pooh Hunny Hunt- amazing trackless ride and it spins and turns- so fun!  We headed to Mickey's PhilarMagic afterwards before watching the fantabulous Celebrate! Tokyo Disneyland for Disney's 35th Anniversary and WORDS CAN'T EXPRESS how amazing it was. It was though magic just happened in front of your eyes. you MUST watch this spectacular performance during this limited period of time. After the performance, we went in souvenir shops and bought more things than in Disneysea (oops!)Wanted to catch the Brand New Dream fireworks at 8.30pm thus we went out to Ikspiari for dinner (there is a very big Disney store!) before going back to Disneyland for a 4 min fireworks that start punctualy at 8.30pm. After a very long day at Disneyland, we bid goodbye and left reluctantly.. We really enjoyed Tokyo Disneyland and finally, had Tokyo Disneyland checked off my list. "
427,2,18-Dec,Australia,Disappointed and left wanting more :-(,"I know it‚Äôs Christmas Day and all and queues are usually long but waiting for 2.5hrs for a 1min ride is ridiculous. Fast track wasn‚Äôt much help either. I understand why, but you couldn‚Äôt book another session until 2hrs had passes since you requested a previous fast track. The thing was our first one at 10:55 gave us a time slot at 18:55 and we couldn‚Äôt go fast track on another ride until 12:55 and all the rides had really long queues...even the food places.It is always nice to see Disney but I was disappointed I couldn‚Äôt embrace the fun stuff and be bring out my inner child again. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be back."
428,5,18-Dec,United Arab Emirates,Super fun Day!,"My 3,5 years old boy could enter the park for free (kids under 4yrs free) and he was tall enough to get the blue wristband (toddlers with height more than 102cm) so he was so happy he could do all the cool rides with his older brother (6yrs old).If you are staying few days in Tokyo, I suggest to check the weather forecast once you arrived and decide the nicest day to go to Disneyland (It was raining the whole day when we arrived at Tokyo Bay where we stayed, got so lucky the next day was dry despite cloudy).Make sure you browse in advance the map and tips & tricks for Disneyland/ Disneysea. Pre-arrange who will do the fastpass hunting as it will totally help the kids (and yourself) to be able to enjoy the park at most. Tips:I literary do the sprint run along bunch of Japanese teenagers once the gate is open (dont forget to bring all the tickets as you need to scan the ticket to get the Fastpass). While you do the hunting, kids and your partner can just stroll nicely to the toontown (minor queus perfect for the young toddlers).The fastpass machine tickets are located at each areas (you can browse further about this). I ran to Tomorrowland and got the 1st FP for the Space Mountain. Check your FP timeline and remember the window time (at the bottom you can see when you are allowed to get another FP). *The most popular queue on our visit was the Pooh‚Äôs Hunny Hunt. By 12am the FP machine was already closed and the normal queu was enormous. So, if you really want to ride this one, you might want to run first to Fantasyland to get the FP. I got in total 6x FP (2x Space Mountain, 2x Buzzlightyear, 2x Splash Mountain, 1x Star Tours).*Star Tours queue was not so bad around 5pm so might keep this ride for the latest. *Don‚Äôt miss the fireworks and lights show on the closing time!

429,5,18-Dec,Australia,Another beauty ,A fabulous Disneyland.Busy but that‚Äôs Tokyo.Food prices were reasonable.Easy to get to from Tokyo.Would recommend 
430,5,18-Dec,United Arab Emirates,Ah!mazing,Awesome superb. One can always become a child at any age üòÅ we made a second trip just to meet mickey mouse whom we missed the first day. Best option is to buy fast track tickets rather than wait in 2hr queues. for fast track too register your names at entrances for timings. Register for 3-4 at a time and visit the rides then. Xmas shows and parades are a must but not to forget to carry some mat or fleece blankets as you are required to sit on floors for hours for the shows and parades. They don't allow u to stand. 
431,5,18-Dec,Singapore,Fun fun fun,"Tokyo Disneyland is a wonderful place. Crowded but if you do your research and strategy, choose the rides and use FastPass, you will enjoy the day. Go early 30-60 mins before the park open to queue. We manage to get 4 FastPass and did most of the rides by 5pm even when it‚Äôs very crowded. Bring your own food and don‚Äôt waste time queuing at restaurant. Can eat in the park. Even churros stand has a queue, but we queued for that as it‚Äôs not such a long wait. There are water cooler to refill water. Definitely a must if you enjoy Disney."
432,3,18-Dec,Malaysia,Crowded,"Crowded everywhere, stalls, ticket counters, washroom, restaurants. I didn‚Äôt enjoy here well, one game have to queue up minimum half an hour and some of the game have to wait for few hours. I saw people everywhere."
433,5,18-Dec,Malaysia,Simply Fantastic,This has to be 1 of the best Disneys. Immaculate Service all round and the attention to details is just amazing. The energy level displayed by all staff is unbelievable. Yes it is crowded but it is organised chaos. Use the Fast Pass! It is there for a reason. Stay for the Parade n just enjoy the atmosphere.
434,3,18-Dec,Singapore,Queues!! ,This had the worst queue in Disneyland!! I visited 3 disney and this Disneyland is about queuing n queuing. Even for food you will need to queue for 45 mins. It simply way too time wasting. Place wise is great and huge are compare to hongkong. Ambience is good with Christmas feel. Remember to get fast pass tickets if not it will take 3 hours to queue for a ride. 
435,5,18-Dec,Australia,Great Disney park...yes it‚Äôs busy,A beautiful park. Yes it gets busy. Go on a week day if you want less of a crowd however it will still be busy. Space mountain and Big Thunder rail road are popular consider using fast pass. Poohs hunny hunt is also extremely popular so a fast pass is recommended. People will wait for long periods of time to reserve seating for parades and shows. Disney attire is popular at this park. Restaurants book out quickly so book on line before visiting if possible however this is in Japanese only. Lots of food and drink options available. Currently decorated for Christmas. Christmas special food options are available at the moment.
436,4,18-Nov,Singapore,Avoid during the weekends,"The queues are long and it‚Äôs generally crowded but if you‚Äôre patient and with kids who are willing to wait, it‚Äôs a magical place. Use the fast pass where possible.  The night parade is outstanding and worthwhile to catch. The food at the restaurants are definitely better than the food at Disney World or Disneyland Paris."
437,5,18-Dec,New Zealand,Something for everyone,"We were here the first week of December and having all the Christmas decorations and parades made the experience just that much more spectacular. We spent 4 days at the parks. When you stay at the Disney Hotels, you‚Äôre able to buy park tickets that allow you to hop between parks from day 1 as well as 15 minute early entry into the parks. This early entry allowed us to get Fastpasses and que for rides well before the huge crowds entered the parks. It was also a great time to get your photos without people in the way. Do your research before you go on how the parks work and what rides are the most popular. Overall we enjoyed the parks just as much as Anaheim and Disney World. The Cast Members were brilliant and most spoke a bit of English so with our limited Japanese, communication wasn‚Äôt a problem. Highly recommend! Something for everyone."
438,5,18-Oct,Indonesia,The happiest place on earth,"To skip the line on the entry gate, its highly recomended for you to purchase the ticket in advance. And make sure to keep the ticket since you will need that to get the FASTPASS.First, once you enter the park, just go directly to the Fastpass machine as soon as possible to get the ticket for the favourite rides. after you collect the Fastpass ticket, then you can enjoy the other rides that do not provide the Fastpass  ticket.This is how you skip the waiting line and enjoy the park as much as possible.If you do not into some parades, just skip it as well, since it will takes about 1 hour (or more) for you to wait and keep the seat on the street. You really need to manage your time well spent to maximize all the rides in Tokyo Disneyland. Considering that in the regular time (weekdays and not peak season) the park itself can be very very crowded.Do some research before visit the park, you can browse the Tokyo Disneyland official website to choose which rides that you wish to play include the park maps.have fun!!"
439,5,18-Sep,Singapore,Enjoying our moment at disneyland,"First time stepping to Tokyo, so it‚Äôs a must to visit tokyo disneyland... I was amazed the moment i step into the disneyland.. It was amazing & i love the parade...The next time i visit japan, i would to go to the disney sea..."
440,5,18-Dec,N/A,35th Anniversary ,The most crowded day that we had ever visited the park but surprisingly it was in an orderly way.  We bought a lot of the anniversary items.
441,5,18-Feb,Indonesia,lovely place!,"Visited disnyeland during the rest of winther is the best choice i had, because i dont have to worry about sweating all day longüíö"
442,4,18-Nov,Philippines,Tokyo,"The happiest place to be. So many things to do like the rides, parades, and attractions. Food is below average and expensive. So many theme areas. You cannot ride all the roller coasters in one day. It takes 30 minutes to wait for each ride. There were 3-4 parades. The best was the Electrical Light Parade in the evening. So many Japanese tourists even if it was a weekday and drizzling."
443,5,18-Mar,Philippines,Happy place,All you can are happy faces. Students are in group wear Disney accessories. Have to bear the long lines for the rides as well as the restaurants.
444,4,18-Dec,Singapore,Much bigger than Hong kong,"This place is much bigger than the HKG disneyland. So you will need 1 to 2 days at least to go around the park if you are going to try for all the rides.However, it is super crowded. One thing to point out though, everyone knows how to queue and there is not cutting of queues. The crowd although alot, but they do not push you around. Kids will love this place. However, note that the language is only in Japanese."
445,4,18-Oct,Jamaica,Great Day!!!,"I went with a friend during Halloween Week but despite the crowd, we had a blast. We were there ALLLLL day and we got to do most of the rides and attractions. Because of the crowds, the lines were a bit long but hey it‚Äôs DisneyLand - it‚Äôs expected. The souvenirs were a bit pricey but again, expected. It really was a good day. One thing I was a bit sad about was that I didn‚Äôt get to see most of the characters but it seemed they were busy for the special Halloween parade. "
446,5,18-Dec,Poland,Happiest Place in the World,Disney Tokyo lived up to my families expectations and probably exceeded them. We arrived at the park at 0825 on a Tuesday and already lines were lengthening for the 0900 opening. We already had our entrance tickets so it didn't take too long to enter the park once that gates opened. As advised we headed straight for the fast pass for the Pooh ride. At that time there was already a long line waiting to get a fast pass. We got other fast passes during the day but unfortunately several clashed with the parades. We ate at Tomorrowland dinner the foud was basic but reasonably priced. By being selective we were able to complete 15 rides in the day waiting no more than 20 minutes for any ride. We took in two parades the best being the evening Electric Parade which was spectacular. You need to claim a good seating spot at least an hour before the parade commences. We started our adventure at 0900 and left the park at 2230. Both the 11-year-old and the 18-year-old stated that it was the happiest day of their lives and that says it all. 
447,1,18-Nov,Singapore,Overcrowded!,"They sell more tickets than the park could take. Everywhere you go is crowded, from main entrance to attractions, restaurants to even toilets. People everywhere. You need to queue to get a fast pass to beat the queue. Otherwise, expect to wait in line for up to 2 hours. On that day I was there, they cancelled the fireworks show on a clear and cloudless evening. Maybe Disney felt that their ticket takings for the day was insufficient to cover the cost of fireworks. If a 6 year old child said it is no fun, this place is indeed not worth the money and time."
448,5,18-Jun,United States,Simply Awesome.,"Went to Tokyo Disneyland in early June, and it was great. First and foremost, it's cheaper than the American Disneyland. For less than $70, you can have an amazing time. The park is actually on a larger tract of land than Anaheim, but there are a handful less rides- meaning the rides are spaced out nicely, and not congested.The park was busy, but not that busy. We used Fast Pass on a lot, and I think the average wait time was about 15-20 minutes. One ride that was super popular was a crazy wait, like 3-4 hours, so we skipped it. There are various Disney characters running around, so it was fun for my toddler to try and get a photo with them. One other major comparison and observation was how reasonable food and drink is at Tokyo Disneyland. In the States, they get you for all you got when it comes to food and drink. In Tokyo, prices are no higher than they would be at any other store. Drinks are about the same as they would be at 711.We went to a restaurant and I had a steak for $12. That would be unheard of in the States. Tokyo Disneyland is super clean, and like just about everywhere else in Japan, super efficient, with impeccable customer service. There are many things to do and ride even for a 2 year old. Of course the options will increase as the age does, but I am glad we went, as my daughter STILL talks about it and remembers how fun it was. So forget when people tell you that your kid won't remember anything. Can't wait to go back. I think it may become an annual thing when we are in Japan."
449,5,18-Oct,Australia,Smiles all round!,Disneyland will have you smiling all day no matter what age you are. The Mickey Mouse shaped food is delicious. The Disney castle and the different themed areas are amazing to look at and take photos of. The only downside is lining up for rides which can take over an hour because the park is always busy. I was there during Halloween and the whole park had pumpkins and other decor which looked amazing.
450,5,18-Dec,Australia,Fantastic but don‚Äôt expect Disneyland USA,"We are mad Disney fans and thought long and hard before visiting this US icon in Japan. We have been to Hong Kong a few times and it just falls way short of expectations and before we visited here we heard mixed reports. I will start by saying if you are looking for an exact replica of the US Disney offerings you will be disappointed as there are some very unique differences. Those differences include Main Street USA is replaced by the Bizarre which still offers an array of great shops but it is different. Once you get past the Bizarre then it is more like the US offerings...... but spoken in Japanese. The park is super clean, cleaner than anything in the US and what really took our breath away was the quality of food. No you won‚Äôt find a turkey leg and there is a mix of US style foods and Japanese food but they are superbly done and of a high quality. The other notable difference is the Japanese love for flavoured popcorn and popcorn buckets which they carry around like a fashion accessories. Chocolate, caramel, soy sauce and salt are just 3 of the some dozen or so flavours and the buckets we have seen included, Steamboat Willie, Olaf, Lightning McQueen, Stitch, Cinderella‚Äôs carriage, Chip and Dale, Mickey and Minnie‚Äôs bow. Some of the attractions are better than the US Disneys too. The Haunted Mansion The Nightmare Before Christmas is much better either Disneyland or Disney World. The beginning of the Pirates of the Caribbean is better and Space Mountain is slightly different. There are some unique items to Tokyo Disney as well - the Pooh rise and the Monster‚Äôs inc ride are only at Tokyo. But here is the issue. Many of the rides are spoken in Japanese. We know what is going on only because of our frequent visits to the US. It may be a deal breaker for many people though and having read some of the reviews here, I see many people struggled with this. Also the merchandise is different. There are not a lot of T-shirts and those they have are limited. Most of the merchandise is food related and we enjoyed this aspect but I know many won‚Äôt. We loved this park and it was like discovering a Disney park all over again. It is very well organised and clean and as I said earlier the food is great.We will be back and loved it. "
451,4,18-Nov,Singapore,A wonderful place for all ages,"We tried not to go there on weekends, so we chose to visit on a Monday. The queues for all the rides were still very long. Even though we didn‚Äôt manage to go on many rides or shows, we still enjoyed ourselves very much. Just being inside the theme park itself was already enough to make us happy.  The atmosphere was wonderful. Oh and the shopping! We love Disney so we spent a lot on the merchandise - cookies, chocolates and souvenirs. Last but not least, we were so impressed with the staff. EVERYONE of them was friendly and looked happy.  They were all so polite.  The Japanese take pride in their jobs.  They made our visit even more pleasant and memorable. I didn‚Äôt give it a full rating only because of the long queues for the rides."
452,1,18-Nov,Singapore,Non-english speaking operators,Took the dragonboat in which the operator who spoke only in Japanese throughout the ride without giving due consideration to the foreign tourists. There wasnt much engagement with non-Japanese visitors.
453,5,18-Nov,Singapore,Awesome Solo Trip ,"Check crowd calendar to be sure you don‚Äôt buy tickets on crazy crowded days. Everyone‚Äôs said it but it bears repeating: FASTPASS is your friend. Get your game plan on and know which are your must-do rides. Get FP for 1st must-do ride, then queue for your 2nd must-do.I‚Äôd advise you to familiarise yourself with the map prior to the trip so that you know exactly where your desired attractions are at which land. Pro-tip: at ToonTown, go to the merchandise shop and you will see a vending machine that dispenses unique Mickey Mouse in baubles. 500yen a try. Guaranteed win and fun! Also plan ahead which food items you want to have and know where they are- if you wing it, you might be too full when you chance upon another cutesy themed food item. Wear comfortable shoes. I went alone so I had my power bank and Netflix shows downloaded for the queues. People watching is fun around the Parks cos they‚Äôre mostly dressed up but not in a queue where you see the same people. So unless you have good company, go prepared.The toilets have those machines that play water sounds ... very Japanese. As an English-speaker, I enjoyed Big Band Beat which was a jazz English show (great tap dancers!) "
454,5,18-Nov,Canada,Great Disneyland,"Loved my time here, it's do-able in one day. It's so nice out here but definitely have to do Disney Sea while you're here!"
455,5,18-Nov,Canada,"It‚Äôs Not The Best Park At Tokyo Disney Resort, But It‚Äôs Very Good","If you had one day at the Tokyo Disney Resort, I wouldn‚Äôt suggest going to this park. Instead I would recommend going to Disneysea instead, it‚Äôs a much better park. Having said that Tokyo Disneyland is a very good Disney park. 90% of the park is great and really fun. The 10% that doesn‚Äôt really work is Adventure Land.Adventure land is a mishmash or random classic Disney attractions smashed together with a very vague theme. Many of the rides are fine, but how they connect to each other doesn‚Äôt make any sense at all. The railroad, also found at Adventure Land, is one of the most disappointing trains in all of the castle parks. The main difference is that the train doesn‚Äôt stop anywhere else except the Adventure Land station. So while it‚Äôs a fun ride, it lacks the usability of the trains at other parks.When we visited there was a lot of construction going on, but other than a huge wall connecting Toon Town (our favourite land) and Tomorrow Land it was fairly unobtrusive."
456,4,18-May,United States,Perfect for Disney fans,"This Disney resort is fantastic for Disney fans of all ages!  Cast Member service is truly excellent.  Souvenirs are particularly well-made and worth buying compared to the offerings at Disneyland (Anaheim) and Disney World (Orlando).  If you have young ones (especially little girls), I HIGHLY suggest the Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall for lunch or dinner.  It is truly a must-see dining experience with an option to purchase unique collectible stoneware.  Restroom facilities are immaculately clean throughout the park.  Also be on the lookout for unique collectible popcorn buckets throughout the various flavored popcorn stations.  Also, the Pooh's Hunny Hunt trackless ride is absolutely phenomenal and should not be missed.Some glaring issues are:1. Japan doesn't have an ADA compliance equivalency, so wheelchairs and strollers may have a difficult time navigating some areas.  2.  The painted concrete ""cobblestone"" areas are ridiculously hard, uncomfortable, and aesthetically ugly.  Disney should have paid for either real cobblestone or smooth concrete."
457,1,18-Nov,Indonesia,Tokyo disneyland is very lousy,"We went to Tokyo disneyland yesterday, and they refuse us to enter, because too many people there. But no announcement! !!! And we had paid the taxi 12.000 yen for nothing. And we want to eat there also, we could not. Because too many people. Management of disney !!!!wake up!!!you make so many people disapointed. Yanny. From bali."
458,4,18-Nov,Singapore,Nice place to be in,"A kids paradise, my wife and kids enjoyed it a lot. Rides were fun, place was spacious and they were tons of people. Staff and people were friendly. Nothing to complain about. Things i were to complain would be the food and long waiting time. Food was expensive and may not be good to have - kind of boring. Queues were long but kind of expected. Fast pass was limited. Definitely better than Disney Sea. Would come again."
459,4,18-Nov,Philippines,"Nice place, but TOO MANY PEOPLE!","I'm not so impressed.(PS: It was my childhood dream, and I know that my third-grade self would be very happy.)I only recommend Tokyo Disneyland if you really have free time. However, for beginners and first-timers, this is so far the child-friendliest Disney park I would ever recommend.It's number of guests do compete with Metro Manila and Bangkok traffic congestions combined hehehe."
460,5,18-Nov,N/A,Very nice and spacious park,"This park is very spacious and when I went it looked like they were expanding. The Christmas parade was nice and the electrical parade was a little different but very nice as well. This park also has a lot of delicious treats as well as different attractions. Pooh's Honey Hunt was a very nice and different ride and is very popular. The lines to get into this park are also very long at park opening! The stores are also very busy, particularly at night making it hard to get around. The Haunted Mansion seems very similar to the one in Florida but at the time I went it was decked out for the holidays with Nightmare Before Christmas, this arrangement was very unique and enjoyable! The castle projection show was also very nice. "
461,1,18-Nov,Singapore,Dont waste your money and time in tokyo disneyland. Worst place ever,"The management let too many people in the park out of greed. Its nearly impossible to take any ride (I manage to get 2 ride (which lasted 5 mins) for the whole day (arrive at 11am).Even going to the toilet (for guys ) need to queue ? I am being honest to share with all of you, unless you have too much free time and nothing better to do, please do not come to Tokyo Disneyland.Hongkong Disneyland in my opinion is a must better option in term of efficiency. The management have the cheek to tell me that everyone is queuing and waited for hours for a ride. My reply would be, why does everyone accept poor services make it right? Money is better and elsewhere like Shibuya or Shinjuku. "
462,5,18-Nov,United States,Always amazing with Disneyland,"This is my 4th Disneyland and I have to say, it is one of my favorites! Disneyland always makes you feel like a kid again. My children LOVED IT! And that was a great thing for us. The place was so clean and well maintained. Staff was polite as usual (for most Japanese that we encountered). They make sure that during the parades everyone will be able to see it. The only downside about this Disneyland is that they don't have the badges that the other Disneyland provides."
463,5,18-Oct,N/A,Lost & Found: a big THANK YOU!!!,"We visited the park in October. While walking around the park, I lost my teddy bear. It was a gift that I received more than 10 years ago and that I was used to take with me when travelling. I couldn‚Äôt believe to have lost it!!My husband decided to go to the lost and found, hoping that someone would have been so kind to return it. The customer service was extremely nice. Other people would have laughed at an adult looking for a lost teddy bear; instead they took our claim seriously and requested a much details as possible.A month after, my teddy bear is back! They sent it all the way to Australia...we couldn‚Äôt believe when we opened the parcel!!!Disney is truely the happiest place on Earth!!Thanks again :)"
464,5,18-Sep,Singapore,Makes you feel like a child again!,"This is the 2nd Disneyland I've visited after HK. LOVE IT. Everybody is so polite. I love the atmosphere. All the sounds and music will make you feel like you are propelled back to childhood where everything is wonderful and imaginative.When we went in Sep-18, it pretty much rained the the whole afternoon. Nonetheless, I love how the park had prepared a contingency parade for rainy day. Thankfully though, we caught the morning parade as well and saw human dances other than the passing floats. Also, try all the popcorns! :D"
465,5,18-Nov,United States,Amazing Experience,"Please visit! This Disneyland is unlike any, I took my wife (her first time) and it was truly a dream come true for her. One employee gave her a ""My first ride"" and ""My first time"", she was even given a key necklace! Food is expensive, as expected, but it's part of the experience. They offer a loop train around he park, about 600¬• day pass which is fine. I would highly suggest this visit, it's a totally different experience. PLEASE NOTE: everything is in Japanese. "
466,4,18-Oct,United States,Worth the trip!,"As a Disney fan, we couldn't pass up a trip to Tokyo Disney. Yes, it is different than what American's are used to, but it does have the Disney magic, with just enough familiar to blend with the new.  Living overseas for a year, we just couldn't miss an opportunity to visit another Disney park.  We enjoyed our time here at DisneyLand.  It is crowded, but just know where you want to go and what you want to do and be prepared to wait in a line or two.  Just let go, have fun and enjoy.    I really only have 3 complaints:1) the rides are tiny; built for the smaller Asian community.  My family is tall so there were a few rides we were all smashed in to.  My husband was almost denied entrance to ride space mountain.  We have no issues in the states, but there was very little wiggle room on this ride and splash mountain.  No room for long legs at all.  Monsters Inc was also a tight fit; a really tight fit!2) Fast passes.  You can only get fast passes at the ride you want to fast pass, so people enter the park and go directly to the ride they want to fast pass, then you have to wait to use it.  You can get your second one at the same time you can use your first one, so you are off to that ride to grab the pass then back to use the first one.  They need to make it so you can get a fast pass for any ride at kiosks instead of having to go all over the park to specific rides.  Much easier in the states.3) Park entrance tickets are not so easy to get.  You cannot order them from outside Japan as the resort does not accept credit card orders outside of Japan.  You can purchase open date tickets from 3rd parties, but you are NOT guaranteed entrance to the park.  During peak times, they may deny entrance if the park is crowded. These wont have dates on them. If you are staying at a Disney hotel you can get dated tickets at the front desk.  Otherwise you'll have to wait in line at the park to purchase tickets.Even with the few exceptions, we really enjoyed our time in the park.  There are many of the familiar DisneyLand rides.  It was Halloween time, so the park was decorated nice.  The majority of people visiting were all dressed up so it was fun to people watch. We enjoyed the Spooky Boo Parade.   I like how you have to sit along the parade route a few rows deep so many can view it along the route.  You are also not allowed to have kids on your shoulders.  The Electric Light Parade was amazing and the best I've seen at any park. It's always best to stick around for the light show on the castle and the fireworks.  As Disney fans we were not disappointed with our visit.Ask if you have any specific questions.  If you are in Tokyo and you can make time, visit the parks.  It is worth it.  DisneySea is amazing as well."
467,5,18-Oct,India,Tokyo Disneyland,"While planning to visit Disneyland , its better to  Pre book the tickets to avoid long queues  we reached at 10 , which is considered late since the park opens at 8 Am and it was already packed by the time we reached .Its better to get your fast pass earlier on or else the wait on a crowded day is around 120 mins for the good rides also its better to avoid the week end , beter visit during the  weekdays if possible.Since we visited in October which was close to Halloween the People were dresse dup as their favourite characters , there are shops that provide the dress hair and make up for extra charge.Not to be missed the fireworks in the evening and the Parades all are good .Splash Mountain not to be missed .Since you can get only 4 fast passe choose wisely.We however spent all day but it was not possible to cover the whole park as there is so much to see.the gift shops are expensive For food there are separate Kiosks selling only certain items , like one would sell only BLT coffee etcBe prepared to walk a lot  and it going to be a long dayAlthough we left the park around 9.pm we did not cover the whole thing .Definately recommend going."
468,5,18-Aug,Australia,Fun!,We arrived at 8am with a pre bought ticket. We got in straight away. Instead of turning right like everyone else we turned left and went to adventure land. Hardly anyone was there. We got our fast pass to Thunder Mountain. We spent nearly 2 hours in that area and got onto everything that we wanted to do. Using the Fast Pass  was great. Even though there were lots of people there we ended up  doing everything we wanted to. The parades were excellent. We did not dress in the same clothes as is the fashion. We spent 12 hours there before rain came. Definately recommend going.
469,5,18-Oct,New Zealand,yes yes yes,"what a day, you could easily spend more than one day.  heaps for the young, old and young at heart.  if you don't like the adrenaline rush rides there are plenty of other rides and sights to see.  long waiting period for rides.  great parades and the light shows at dusk are breath taking.  a must to go, be prepared for a long day"
470,5,17-Dec,N/A,The place must go,"Great tourism place for family, lots of fun and beautiful evening show. Fireworks and the Disney show melt my heart. "
471,2,18-Nov,Canada,Time equation is broken,"If a ride lasts one minute it is worth one minute of my time to wait in line. Not an hour.And this was on a weekday in November. What anyone would spend the time to travel to Disneyland, wait in line for admission and then wait for a ride is beyond me.Give it a pass and ave the money."
472,5,18-Oct,Australia,Bucket list ,Love Love Love. Don‚Äôt forget fast pass. Avoid national holidays as it‚Äôs busier then usual but regardless it‚Äôs full on with tourists of all nations. We stayed from 8.30am to 10.30pm. 
473,5,18-Aug,N/A,Memorable trip for my family,"The theme park itself was full of amazing attractions for both kids and adults.  Better make good use of their fast pass system to go on more rides.  Parades were good, fireworks was good and staff was really nice!  My daughter aged 6 liked the Monsters Inc ride the most and we managed to go on it twice even we had to be in line for around 45 mins for our second time.  Strongly recommend to stay at a hotel near the park so you can get to the park early in the morning and also have a place to rest nearby after you leave the park.  Was a pity I was going to reserve one of the diner shows in the park but the system was really a hassle to get into.  Will try again when we go next time.

474,5,18-Jun,United States,Great way to spend my birthday. ,"A group of coworkers convinced me to go to Japan for a few days for my birthday and I spent the only full day we had at Disney. As a huge Disney fan I was not disappointed. The Haunted Mansion broke down on us, big surprise, and we were offers a free fast pass to any ride. I opted to keep the voucher as a souvenir since that was one of the last rides for us. I would highly recommend to anyone in Japan for a few days. "
475,5,18-Oct,Sweden,Vacation Tokyo Disneyland ,"Excellent day in Tokyo Disneyland. An experience that brings joy to everyone üíïGood food at the restaurants, sometimes pricey, but worth the experience.Get there early, 2 hours, before opening. Expect thousands of people standing in line at 7.00 o‚Äôclock. Bring some snacks and drinks for the waiting.Buy the tickets in advance and grab the map as soon as you enter the park. Good to know where the restrooms are üëçüèªUse comfortable shoes! A lot of walking!"
476,4,18-Nov,N/A,Always check the crowd calendar,"I've heard Tokyo Disneyland horror stories about the crowd and wait hours for the rides so we came prepared. I'm glad to say we were able to go on 8 rides and attractions and we could have done more if we didn't rest and snack as much. Tip 1: Always check the crowd calendar to choose the best date for your visit.Tip 2: Go on a weekday. We went on a Friday and the lines were manageable. Tip 3: Maximize your fast passes. First thing to do after park entry is get your first fast pass. Don't go on a ride yet. Efficiency is a must for this park. Same advice for your next fast passes - if it's already time for your next fastpass, get it first before doing anything else. Tip 4: Do Pirates of the Caribbean and Star Wars while waiting for your fastpass rides.  The lines here are short and quick but the attractions are more than decent. They're fun. Don't let the lines or lack thereof fool you.Tip 5: Wear something weird or cute for a more fun experience. You won't stand out.Tip 5: Skip Philharmagic. It was a bit of a drag.Tip 6: If you want to try the famous Disney popcorn and not particular as to flavor, get the soy-flavored ones outside Star Wars. I never saw a queue there. It actually was very good but, of course, the caramel-flavored ones were so much better.Tip 7: If you run out of fastpasses, go on the standby queues during parade hours. Most people would be watching the parade then. Tip 8: Find a good spot for the night parade at least an hour before."
477,5,18-Nov,N/A,Magical,"Everything felt magical, starting from you ride the train to go there. And when you reach there, you will be welcomed by endless Disney songs."
478,5,18-Sep,Australia,Disney Land-Japanese Style.,"Wow, The most Magical place on Earth is also in Japan, Its cleaner, Its bigger (compared to Original) Its just so beautiful. The food is different, in taste, style & presentation is to die for. "
479,5,18-Apr,N/A,best Disneyland,"Not my first time but the first with my whole family who loved the experience. It is the best Disneyland in the world, in my opinion. Good food (on the pricey side, but worth it), good shows, good attractions. Stay for the evening parade and fireworks (weather permitting)."
480,3,18-Oct,United States,Cheap but Crazy,"Tokyo Disneyland is very affordable in comparison to Disneyland in Anaheim, for two adult tickets we paid $132.00 (which is the price of one ticket in California.) The fastpasses are pretty much completely out by 11 am on the busy days. On average the ride wait times are between 80-120 minutes. There are people everywhere! It is insane. The food is very affordable, less than $3.50 for a small popcorn, less than $10 for a hot dog meal and churros are only like $2."
481,1,18-May,United States,"Very small, boring and boring","This is a miniature version of Disneyland, a poor copy. There are not many rides, events or things to do. The Disney character just stand around and wave since they cannot speak English. It is a very disappoint park if you are not Japanese"
482,2,18-Oct,United Kingdom,Finally See What Disney is All About. ,"Entered the park before 9am and picked up our first fast past at 9:10, the slot was for 10:45. Walked to another ride and was there at 9:20. Waiting time 100 minutes ..... waited 85 mins and finally go in the ride. This continued all day.One fast pass I got at 13:00 showed the slot at 20:15hrs.... Not sure if this is a mistake? 30 minute Q for popcorn, 10 minute Q for toilets.... come on Disney......Bottom line, great staff and a clean park but to get only 4 rides on the day we visited..... poor."
483,5,18-Oct,Singapore,I love it ,"I enjoy visiting there a lot . All the costumes characters felt realistic . It‚Äôs colourful and there is a lot of things to do. But, most of the food is not very good . But, I recommend the Mickey Mouse ice cream sandwich and caramel pop corn . I do not like - curry pop corn , Captain Hook pizza , crystal palace , queen of heart  . "
484,5,18-Oct,United States,Best Disney Park I‚Äôve been too,"Ok..  Anaheim Disneyland is the originators, that cannot be helped.  But Tokyo Disneyland perfected the system.  Ok I admit, Tokyo Disneyland doesn‚Äôt have Marvel and Star Wars themed in it but I doesn‚Äôt matter to me.  Here‚Äôs the advantage:    1.  Price:  2 parks for around $140!!  In Anaheim that‚Äôs 1 park alone!  Ok, there‚Äôs no park hopper pass, no big deal.  On top of that, food and merch is waaaaayyy cheaper.  2.  Space:  At Anaheim, there‚Äôs a bottle neck right after the entry to the park.  Tokyo, has a little bottle beck but there is significant space.  3.  Specialty Popcorn:  curry popcorn?  What?!  4.  Staff:  So professional and helpful.  Yes, there might a bit of a language barrier but they‚Äôll make sure that you are served right.  Not to mention that they have an awesome system when working the parades.  5.  The Atmosphere:  I‚Äôll just say this.  The people that go to Disneyland are so into it.  They dress for the occasion!  Ok..  it may have been in October but they know how to get into the spirit like majorly.  Not to mention that they participate so well during parades and they also sit down so the people in the back can watch as well.  You don‚Äôt get that anywhere.I‚Äôll come to Tokyo Disneyland before Anaheim any day."
485,4,17-Dec,Singapore,Our first stop,This was our first Disneyland and the family's excitement was beyond words. We spend the whole day exploring the place but it was not enough. The park is huge. We also loved the pop-corn and spend a lot of time and money in those gift shops.
486,5,18-Oct,Singapore,Still the most magical place,"Japan‚Äôs Disney resort is frankly a notch above the rest. In part because of their culture, and local population which simply makes visiting their parks such an enjoyable experience. Downside of course is everything is in Japanese. üòÖDuring Halloween, a lot of visitors come in costume, which adds to the atmosphere and fun.Pro tip for rides, grab the fast pass for the popular rides like Winnie the Pooh first thing you enter. Simply enjoy the park and parades during the day, ride queues considerably shorten after 8pm, mainly as families with young kids would have left by then. But if you are visiting during school holidays when teenagers are the bulk...Shopping doesn‚Äôt close until the last visitor has left, so if you do not want to go around with a big bag of shopping, leave that for the last when you are leaving. Do note that some merchandise may be available only in certain locations though."
487,5,18-Oct,New Zealand,Magical Disney,Tokyo Disneyland delivers on the Disney magic and does not disappoint.  Tokyo Disneyland is easily to access with a short train trip from Tokyo Station.The park has all the signs etc in English so you wouldn‚Äôt get lost/confused.  The staff are super helpful and friendly too.  
488,5,18-Oct,Portugal,great experience,what to say always good to visit disneyland this was out 3rd one in the world and i assume was great crowded as always and as usual huge line to the attractions but was really good . just missed some things in the stores that Paris disney and hong kong have much more different items.
489,5,18-Oct,United States,Beautiful Disney Park!,"If you are a Disney fan, you will love Tokyo Disneyland.  So much is familiar, yet different at the same time. The attractions, of course, are amazing. I did not understand why Pooh's Honey Hunt was the biggest attraction... until I rode it!  (seriously, do not miss this one, even if like us, you have no small children in tow). The ""Dreaming Up"" parade was so magical that this former Disneyland cast member cried... and ended up buying the audio CD!"
490,5,18-Oct,Egypt,Exceptionally fantastic. great time is guaranteed.,"You will have fun all the day. First you have to decide either going to Disney land or Disney sea. I think Disney land is the the first target, as it represents the traditional idea. Please do Not miss any of the shows, around 3 shows / day. The evening show "" Electric parade "" is a dream show, a Must sea.   Happy day -for all ages- will be - always - a lovely memory.     Enojy."
491,5,18-Oct,Thailand,You're never to old for a bit of Disney,"We caught the 07.39 shuttle seven bus for Disneyland after having breakfast at Gusto's Kasai. The opening time on the Disney website said 09.00 but on our arrival at 08.00 the gates were already open. As I had already bought our tickets from the Tokyo Disney resort ticket center at the Ikspiari shopping mall on our first night, we walked straight in without any queues. Couldn't believe what was happening as many people were just sitting down to get a front row seat on the parade route. We headed straight for Big thunder mountain ride where there was only a 15 minute queue. On exiting the ride two of us walked to splash mountain to get 5 fast passes for our family. The time on the ticket was 11.30 - 12.30 so we did a show & 3 rides before returning, The enchanted tiki room stitch presents, western river railroad, jungle cruise & pirates of the Caribbean. With our fast passes in hand the queue for splash mountain was less than 10 mins. After the ride it was time to eat so while 3 stood in line at Grandma Sarah's kitchen 2 of us went to get fast passes for Haunted mansion. After lunch we had a bit of time before we could use our fastpasses so we took a ride on the Mark Twain riverboat then it was time for Haunted mansion. We walked to the Peter Pan's flight ride after but there was a 40 minute queue so we decided to give it a miss. From there we walked through the castle to Tomorrowland hall to try our luck on the show lottery. 3.55 Spooky ""Boo!"" Parade & 6.20 one man's Dream but no luck. We walked back to the centre of the park & Sat down to have a rest & eat the snacks we had brought with us into the park. The Spooky ""Boo!"" Parade passed by but we were to far away to see much. After the parade had finished we went back to Tomorrowland & took a ride on the Star tours ride as there was only a 10 minute queue. We had dinner at  Plasma Ray's Diner. The light parade was at 7.30 so we had 1 1/2 hours to kill so my wife & one son went shopping in the World Bazaar whilst me & my other two sons went to the Monsters Inc ride, there was a 50 minute standby queue as we didn't have fastpasses but we decided to wait in line. When we arrived for the Electrical parade there were rows of people 12 deep. My wife & son's Sat down behind but as I cannot sit on the floor I just lent against a railing. After a few minutes a member of staff came & told me I must sit, but after I had explained to him I could not sit he said follow me (my family as well) wow, we ended up with a front row seat. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. The Electrical parade was  fantastic! After the parade we headed for the castle to watch the Brand New Dream fireworks at 8.30 & Celebrate! Tokyo Disneyland at 9.15. We got another excellent viewing location with a seat. Amazing show, what a finale to a super day. We left the park after the show & caught the bus back to Kasai from bus stop 9. Looking back on my review I cannot believe how much we packed into a day, fastpasses are a must if you don't like standing in queues,  Fast pass (¬•0). Your bags are checked when you enter the park but we took lots of snacks without any problem. Thanks Disney for a magical day! Happy Halloween üéÉ"
492,5,18-Jan,Thailand,Time machine ,"Like a return by time machine, lots of fun activities and people around smile on their face,but only one thinks need more time to touch & keep all funny time in my memory "
493,2,18-Oct,Australia,Lines worse than ever imagined.,"The employees were lovely and polite. Unfortunately, the lines were a lot longer than anticipated. Minimum of 40 minutes to get food (sometimes the line would circle around the stall). Average of 60 minutes for a ride/exhibition. We didn't attempt to line-up for the most popular ones. My friend and I are not massive Disney fans so we would not recommend this to our friends - it's a waste of time if only in Japan a short time. For Disney fans I would recommend buying a fast pass to skip most of the queue, entering after midday or getting a multiday ticket."
494,5,18-Aug,Indonesia,Best services,"Disneyland is a place where dreams come true, yes it is! Everyone had so much fun in there.But for Moslem, is it Moslem friendly? The answer is yaaaas! There is no Mosque in Tokyo Disneyland.If you‚Äôre a Moslem and you want to pray (shalat) just ask to the tourism information centre, and yas! They will preparing a room for you to pray in the special room for 30 minutes. But, you must take ‚Äòwudhu‚Äô first in the nearby toilet and dont forget to bring your own moslem stuff for praying."
495,1,18-Oct,Philippines,Terrible....,It‚Äôs not the happiest place on earth anymore. There‚Äôs a lot of people. It took us 80min to wait in line for each ride 40min in a resto line and even in restrooms 20min waiting in line. 
496,5,18-Oct,Indonesia,The castle still have its magic..,"Well.. we are in Tokyo anyway.. so we go to the Castle of Magic.. Disneyland.. with ¬•7600 (arround US$70) for adult one daypass, it will be suffice to go arround. There are plenty for everyone. They even have a costum rent store so you can go arround the park as your fav character.. you will see matching outfits of couple, disney character or even group of matching outfits.. be as daring as you can be, no one will judge you.. plenty of cafƒõ/diner too.. many baby cart park infront of some attraction. If you are like the speed and height that push your adrenalins, start from the 'Tomorrow land' on right side.. if you wanna take it slow, start from your left side.. beware of huge queue.. you have to line at least 30 minutes or more for major attraction. There are short cut with 'fast pass' but with additional charge (well... advantage come with price folks..). There are parades.. the day and night parade.. its magic for cameras..and many souvenirs shops that would magically drain your wallet with their cute things üòÅüòÅ. Its open on 8 AM and close at 10PM. My suggestion: come as early as possible, not weekend preferably. Bring your drink and food as there are many comfortable bench or chair around. Especially if you need spesific food (like halal food for instance). There are public transport to go to this place (keiyo line to Maihama from Tokyo Station). Just prepare your leg, as you will walk and stand a lot..."
497,1,18-Oct,N/A,"beware those with allergies, disabilities, & dietary restrictions","If you have an allergy, disability, or any kind of special needs, be very careful. I realized they were unable to accommodate me, despite their website advertising otherwise, and I was unable to get a refund."
498,4,18-Sep,Singapore,Heaven for kids,"The staff do a great job maintaining this park. It‚Äôs clean, staff are friendly and helpful, the queue is smooth. It was raining on & off during the day, but the kids‚Äô spirit stays high. The park ie more for young kids, unlike DisneySea. My sons can‚Äôt wait to go back there again."
499,5,18-Aug,United States,Magical,"Been to the other Disney parks and this one doesnt disappoint either. Its clean,  cheerful, and busy. Maybe too busy for some but thats life. All in all a great place to visit."
500,5,18-Oct,Japan,The familiar magic of Disney combined with Japanese efficiency!,"If you‚Äôve been to any of the other Disney parks around the world, you‚Äôll have a good idea of what to expect from Tokyo Disneyland: Fun attractions for all the family and incredible theming.Tokyo Disneyland offers all of this and then some, combining the beloved attractions with very effective management to help you make the most out of your day. Staff are very friendly and helpful with getting guests on and off of rides as quickly as possible, which helps to minimise the wait times as much as possible.The wait times are still an issue though and even on the less busy days, you‚Äôll want to go into the park with a strategy for how to beat the queues. The most popular rides seemed to be Pooh‚Äôs Hunny Hunt and Splash Mountain, so I would definitely prioritise getting fast passes for these rides as early in the day as you can."
501,5,18-Feb,Indonesia,Best experience,My childhood's dream become real. Be a princess for a whole day. Hehehehe.. I love the food especially the taste of the popcorn.
502,5,18-Oct,United Kingdom,Magical Day!,"We couldn't book tickets online in advance on the website and were very worried about queuing for tickets as everyone advises it gets busy - it WAS busy but no where near as bad as I thought it would be. We did go on a Tuesday so I assume this was quieter than usual but still full of people.We had an amazing day, the staff are super friendly and more than happy to help - shout out to the cast member that got an amazing photo of me and my friends in front of the castle because she knew the perfect spot to get a good angle.Queues for rides were quite long at times but this was expected. Worth it just for the parades to be honest, we saw the Halloween one and the Light Parade in the evening followed by the fireworks. All so magical, really made the day perfect. Would definitely recommend coming here, we had such a great day!"
503,5,18-Oct,Malaysia,Excellent!,"Friendly staff! Fast with service! Like their arrangement for service! Crowded but don‚Äôt need to wait too long time. Not enough for one day visit. The road show and light show is perfect! Unfortunately, they didn‚Äôt have the Disney signature fireworks which across over the castle. Will go again! Suggest to go earlier to the fast pass machine area to get your fast pass. You can skip the long queue with fast pass. "
504,5,18-May,Philippines,Unplanned Visit,"Since it was just my husband and I travelling to Tokyo, we were a bit hesitant to visit their Tokyo Disneyland so we arrived around 1pm. Lines were very long with each ride but once you get into their rides you will really love it because it brings out the child in you. Although we came here unplanned and wasn't able to maximize the entire place, we enjoyed the parade at night think of this experience as one of the happiest experience in Japan. We plan to go back again together with our 4 kids next summer. "
505,5,18-Oct,United States,Maybe the best Disney,"Tokyo Disney is our fifth (Anaheim, Orlando, Paris, and Hong Kong), and in many ways it was the best.  All the Disney magic, but with the cleanliness, orderliness and politeness of Japan.  We went on a day that was a little crowded (but not enormously so), and were never jostled, hustled, or had our view cut-off. People universally queue up, and sit-down to watch the parades and shows. We loved that so many patrons came in costumes, and there was a real embrace of the Disney merchandise. There a few unique rides, a few updates of old favorites, and an overall design flair that wonderful, welcome and undeniable. It is, however, a Japanese park, in Japan, that caters to Japanese guests, so just embrace the different foods and the fact that the ride narrations are in Japanese.  Everyone was very (very!) helpful, however, and we found maps and guides in English and were able to eat, makes purchases and use the ATM just fine."
506,5,18-Aug,Germany,Best Disneyland so far,"I have seen now 3 Disneyland (Florida, Paris, Tokyo) and I am stunned to be amazed again. This Disneyland is well worth a visit, minimum 1 whole day. It is very entertaining, lots of fun rides for every age group.Get your Fast Track tickets quick, they get out fast. Fast Track tickets cannot be bought in advance but need to be collected at Fast Track machines close to the rides. Waiting time my go up to several hours, so get them in time."
507,5,18-Sep,United States,Its Disney at its Best,I am a huge Disney fan. I have been to the US parks many times and I was unsure what to expect. We bought our tickets ahead of time. We went during the week on a Tuesday when school had started. It was not a holiday for Japan either. The crowd was nothing like I had been preparing for. It was light in comparison to the States. The most we had to wait for any ride was maybe 20/30 minutes at most. We did our fast passes too as often as we could. The park and the restrooms were clean as I have come to expect Disney parks to be. And there were plenty of restrooms and stalls.The food and snacks definitely have a Japanese twist to them...Not all of them. Nearly all the places have the menus posted outside. Popcorn is a huge snack here and it comes in several different flavors. A large is also about 23.00 us dollars. However you do get your pick of  cool popcorn containers in the shape of many characters. The cast members I had encounters with were helpful. I tended to ask if they spoke English before I just started asking my question. They were helpful and if they spoke no English there was someone that they could point to that did. Several of the rides we did were all in Japanese but for me that was ok. You still got what was going on.The BIGGEST I can recommend is making sure to by your treasures as you go. If you see something in one place do not expect to find it in other places. The apps for the park do not work with US phones so there is no using the shop parks app to find or buy things. There is no online shop either. The Disney stores with the exception of the one located by the parks do not carry park items. So buy as you go.The prices are very fair and most cases are same or cheaper than the US parks. It rained while we were there and nothing stopped. Everything continued on.
508,5,18-Oct,Canada,The Best,"Clean, fun, and busy, this place is exactly what you expect of Disneyland and then some (including the outrageously-priced popcorn). If you really want to do it up like the Japanese, come in costume (yes even the adults) or dress your group in matching outfits. The parades are great and everyone sits respectfully on the ground, so there's no jostling for a better view. You can get a Happy Birthday sticker if it's your birthday, and almost every staff person will wish you a happy birthday."
509,5,18-Oct,Australia,Changed my view on Disneyland,"I went to Disneyland in California previously and I hated the experience so much, I vowed never to go to another Disneyland again. But I had to break that promise for the sake of my kids, aged 8 and 9 when we went to Tokyo. The place is an easy hour train ride from Tokyo and we went there on a Tuesday which I understand is one of the less busier days. There were still massive crowds but we probably only waited an average of 30 mins for the rides, including the fast pass. We went on about 10 rides in a space of 12 hours which I thought was pretty good. Everything was in Japanese so we didn‚Äôt really understand what was happening, especially when we went to Haunted Mansion and Star Tours but it was still good overall. There is a massive selection of food at the place but I would bypass Grandma Sara‚Äôs Kitchen next time. The burgers at Tomorrowland Terrace were better and cheaper. We also tried the Mickey waffles which we could smell from a mile away and were absolutely divine. We stayed back for the parade and the fireworks and I can understand why people say Disneyland is the happiest place on Earth. Despite the crowds, everyone was in good spirits and would often wave at each other. I loved the experience here, and hope to come back again and even check out Disney Sea. "
510,3,18-Oct,Australia,Not sure how I would rate this ,We spent 5 days in Disney California and to be honest could have spent more !!!Disney Tokyo not sure how I feel ... I was careful to book as per their calendar and book a light day but when we arrived ( early) there was literally thousands of people and I mean thousands ... not sure they stop selling tickets ... we moved with the flood of people and it was difficult to really look at anything in the main area.We spent up to an hour in line for each ride ( remember this was marked as a quiet day) and the kids felt the rides were all the same .  Everything is in Japanese does not really cater for foreigners but was an experience.I am such a fan of Disney so I loved the experience but would of been concerned if it was a super hot day as no cover at all.As a ride fan family I would call it a soft park ... my kids prefer the adventure park experience and for what it cost us to do one day in a Tokyo we paid for 5 in the USA.Still it‚Äôs an experience and we loved it but not sure if I had limited time in a Tokyo it would be a top 5 must do ..
511,1,18-Oct,Thailand,Worst experience ever,"Here they only prefer Japanese, very racist unhelpful people, don‚Äôt speak English, worst experience ever,Sick people,Have been to shanghai Disneyland, Hong Kong Disneyland. All are very accommodating to children,These crazy people expected my 2 year old to walk in himself to the show,It was for One mans dream 2,This was the crazy man who expected my toddler to walk in himself,I left after this experience,Strongly advise people to maybe try other rides or do other things here in Japan,"
512,5,18-Oct,United States,Loved both Disneyland and Disney Sea,We went there for two days and it wasn‚Äôt enough. We were barely able to do most of the rides. We didn‚Äôt have time to do any of the shows. But we can do it the next time that we are there. I wish that there were character greetings like Jasmine and Aladdin. We loved seeing people dressed in cosplay costumes.
513,5,18-Oct,Canada,Best Disneyland,"I have been to all the Disneylands and Tokyo Disney is my favorite. I visited Tokyo Disney when I was a teenager 30 years ago. It‚Äôs definitely been upgraded but still very orderly and fun! We took our two kids (teenager and 6 yr old) and they both loved it. They agreed it was better than HK Disney and Shanghai Disney even though Tokyo‚Äôs was more crowded. Perhaps it‚Äôs the immaculate lines and how people quietly wait for their turn in line. No one ‚Äúcuts‚Äù the line here. The staff here were also very friendly and were all smiles.Food was decent. We liked the pizza. The popcorn was good too. My 6 year old really wanted the plastic popcorn container of various Disney Characters that everyone had but at 2200 it was a bit pricey. The gift stores were unique with tons of Disney merchandise.Overall, we had a fantastic time here!"
514,5,18-Oct,New Zealand,The best,"I went with my wife and 10 year old son. We had a fantastic time. We went during the week to avoid the queues. Learn how to use fastpasses in advance. People watching was excellent. So many cool costumes worn by patrons. Not speaking Japanese didn't detract from the experience. C3PO actually sounds better in Japanese. Food was of a good quality. Lots of choice. Pricing of food and merchandise was fair & reasonable in my opinion. There are better rides at other parks, but overall experience of Tokyo Disneyland is fantastic!"
515,4,18-Oct,United States,It‚Äôs Disney,"We spent 1 day in Disneyland with 3 adults and one toddler.  Everything was decorated for Halloween which was sort of cool.  We rented a stroller for 1000 yen or roughly 10 USD for the whole day.  If you need to leave the park you just take your name tag with you and when you return you can get another stroller to use.  They had the Disney Halloween parade which was very nice.  The park overall was a little more crowded that the Sea park, but everything was done in an orderly fashion Japanese style, and that made it nice.  We didn‚Äôt really do too many rides because it was pretty crowded, but the ones we did we did with a fast pass.  We wanted to go see Mickey and Minnie but the wait was a little too long for our toddler (2 yrs old) .  We saw Minnie at Sea-park with only a 35 minute wait.  I would go back without a toddler.  It was just too crowded for her.  But like any other Disney, it was still a lot of fun.  After all it is Disney.  "
516,4,18-Jul,Australia,Pick your day carefully and then enjoy!,"My 18yo insists that any day at Disney is a good day.  With horror stories re: crowds we picked our day very carefully, pre-booked tickets and set off from our city hotel early (via train cost about $2.50 AUD - bargain!)  The planning was rewarded - we  were able to secure fast passes and go on most of the Fantasy Land rides (which always take forever) by 11 AM.  Compared to other parks (we've been fortunate to visit multiple other Disney locations) this was the most tired and to me, felt like a lesser, smaller  version of California.  I note they are planning on building a new section and are also upgrading some areas.  HK by comparison had a different vibe (granted Disney Sea is totally different but I am referring to Disneyland) with, in my opinion, much better food than here.  Transport from the city was easy and cheap.  It is still the happiest place on earth!"
517,3,18-Oct,Australia,Tokyo Disney ,"We attended Tokyo Disney with two young children and legally blind guest.The staff were very friendly, the park was exceptionally clean and the park catered for disabilities better to any other theme parks around the world.There were heaps of rides to choose from but the lines were long. There was also not enough seating or shade. There seemed to be way too many people and the food lines were crazy! Whilst we had a good time, it was a big day with no place to stop and rest!"
518,4,18-Apr,N/A,Fun for the kids. Countless throwbacks for the adults,I'd recommend this theme park for families with younger children. The attractions were very entertaining but weren't exciting enough for the thrill-seeking teenagers. We were here during the Japanese Golden Week so it was quite packed and the waiting lines were HUGE. Some of the rides did seem to be a let down after the massive wait but all in all were purpose built to entertain the younger generation.
519,5,18-Oct,Australia,Awesomely good,"We travelled to Disneyland Tokyo because it did not present serious jet lag issues for kids on a week's school holiday from Australia. Having been to Disneyland (Anaheim), Disneyworld (Orlando) and Eurodisney (Paris) we can comfortably say that this is the best so far. Clean, well organised with pleasant staff it was part of a great holiday for six kids ‚Ä¶ and good value, too."
520,5,18-Oct,Australia,Fabulous,"Very well organised, clean and efficient. The street parades were very professional and the staff never stopped smiling no matter what their job was.We have been to most other Disneyland‚Äôs and this is certainly one of the best."
521,5,18-Sep,Singapore,One day pass is not enough,"This theme park is recommended for families with young children. My 3yo was denied entry for one ride due to height restriction. Otherwise, it‚Äôs the usual. Long queues everywhere. Suggest to get multiple day passes, as we covered only 3 areas with our one day pass. Park attendants speaks little English. Rides explanations are in Japanese only. "
522,5,18-Oct,Japan,The happiest place on earth.,"I‚Äôve been to Tokyo Disney Land more than 50 times since I‚Äôve moved to Tokyo.  There‚Äôs always something new going on!  The themes of the park change starting from at the beginning of the year with ‚ÄúNew Years‚Äù theme, then ‚ÄúSpring‚Äù theme, then ‚Äúsummer‚Äù theme, then ‚ÄúHalloween ‚Äú theme, and ending with ‚ÄúChristmas‚Äù theme.  Every theme has a different parade that goes through the park and different shows on the Cinderella‚Äôs castle stage. Also, the park is decorated differently all over the park! The popcorn stands change the taste of the popcorn as well."
523,5,18-Aug,Canada,Wow!,"My favourite park! I was here when they celebrated the 5th year anniversary 30 years later, I'm back celebrating the Happiest 35th Celebration party and it is indeed the best experience ever. The rides here are way better than the rides at WDW."
524,1,18-Aug,United Kingdom,most of the shows (street parades) were cancelled,"due to inclement weather (really?) ok so there as sone rain but time after time they cancelled the shows, poor performance, even when the weather changed they still put on a temporary show of 3 floats which were just a huge joke. On the plus side some of the rides were really good, but typically you can only access fast passes in small numbers and queues everywhere in the sun were horrible."
525,5,18-Jun,Saudi Arabia,Awesome Tokyo Disneyland experience!!!,"This was my family's first trip to any Disneyland. We decided to make this one our first one, as we were visiting Japan anyways.Upon the advice of some of our Japanese friends, we went on a Tuesday to avoid the huge crowds. With one of our Japanese friend's assistance, we purchased our Disneyland tickets from a local convenience store. This definitely saved us some time when we arrived at the theme park. Purchasing this way, we even managed to save a little from the official 7,400 yen per adult ticket price (6,400 yen each for children aged 12-17; 4,800 yen each for children aged 4-11). Once inside the park, it was fairly easy to navigate where things were, etc. The issued map and the staff are very helpful. All in all, we had a great time."
526,4,18-Sep,Mexico,Ok,"Ok, realy at the last minute, did bit go in, because l been in the two who Are in the  USA, so l prefered to go some where else"
527,1,18-Sep,N/A,A big fraud,"It was my first time in Disney parks, and I was really expecting this... We bought Disney tickets months in advanced. In particular, we bought the ticket not in a weekend day (Monday) to avoid long queues. However, the queues are ridiculously long  - 90-110 minutes for one ride, it is a hot day and there are no shadows or air conditions for the lines. Even for a bottle of water you have to wait long time in line.Overall we had one small ride, and because we are super tired of waiting and walking in this overcrowded park, we decided to leave and lose the costly ticket value.The park is beautiful but this alone does not give excuse for the park management to be greedy and enter so many people. In our opinion this park isabsolutely not fare for children and for their parents."
528,5,18-Jun,Singapore,Reminiscing my childhood days...,"Brought my family here to celebrate our eldest and 2nd girl's birthday. This place is really huge compare to Hong Kong Disneyland. Transport is easy accessible. The people are super friendly and approachable. You might want to reach there at least 1.5 hours before the opening time as the queue are super long regardless of which day you are going. Honestly, 1 day to spend at the park is not enough as mentioned it is super huge and you wouldn't want to miss rides or attractions. It's a must to stay until the park closes as there are night parades as well as fireworks. Overall was amazing and awesome. Can't wait to go visit to other Disneyland parks."
529,4,18-Sep,Netherlands,Beautiful but so crowded,"We visited on a tuesday in september. We had already visited Universal Studios in Osaka so we knew to expect crowds but wow, it was real crowded!Lots of people seemingly only show up for the parades. We were there from morning to sundown, and there were 3 or 4 parades during that time. It‚Äôs very difficult to get from one side of the park to the next during these events.The rides were nice! We especially enjoyed Monsters Inc. and Winnie the Pooh, rides we don‚Äôt have in Disneyland Paris. "
530,4,17-Nov,Australia,Magic with a smile.,"Gotta say l thoroughly enjoy disney parks apart from Hong Kong. This park has most of the attractions and the marketing magic. It was reasonably quiet on this day which gives you more time to enhance your visit.No disappointments here, no brainer.Book, visit, and just enjoy a trip away from the everyday."
531,5,18-Sep,Australia,Always good fun,Immaculate gardens and entrance. Lots of parades and fun characters wandering around. It‚Äôs a lively active atmosphere at Disneyland. There‚Äôs something for everyone to enjoy.We arrived around midday and all the food venues were very busy with long queues and long waits. Shops at every themed area well stocked with souvenirs. Plenty of seating around for well needed rest stops.Same as all theme parks the popular rides had 70-90 minute waits so we weren‚Äôt prepared to line up as it was a very hot day. The choice is yours but be prepared to wait for any ride or show. Maybe plan your day so you don‚Äôt miss out . 
532,4,18-Sep,United States,Great Day of fun,"We could not buy tickets online so we had to get to the park early to make sure we got tickets. The ticket booth opens at 0700 so we made sure we got there to get tickets by 0730. We had no issues getting tickets and could have actually waited until the park opened to get tickets. We went on a Monday but park was still VERY crowded by the end of the day. We ate at restaurants with set menus, suggest you just wait in line, they move quickly. We did not get a fast pass and the only tie. That was frustrating was on the Monsters Inc ride, which we waited for for 45 minutes before we left the line due to them letting ONLY fast pass entry. It is worthwhile to visit the gift shop after you leave the park, quite large and a wide variety of items to choose from. All in all a great day with our family. "
533,5,18-Sep,Australia,Fantastic day out,"We are both in our 70's and have been to all the Disney locations bar Paris (Disneyland LA 6 times) and to date, this would have to be the best.Why - Well it seems that everyone in Japan goes out of their way to turn the day into one huge celebration of fun. Everyone is dressed up in character and they just make you have such a great time. People go out of their way to make sure you are having a good time."
534,5,18-Sep,Australia,The Happiest Place on Earth,"It poured with rain on our first afternoon at Disneyland so a lot of the parades were cancelled. The indoor rides were best, but in the end we gave up to try again the next day.Great rides which you will find at most Disneyland‚Äôs with a couple of new/Tokyo specific ones. My 3 1/2 year old daughter found quite a few of them to be too much including Pooh‚Äôs honey ride and Snow White‚Äôs Adventure as they were quite dark in nature.September and October are Halloween months so everyone is allowed to dress up and it was amazing to see all the guests in full costume - some better than the actual cast members.There are some extra parades for Halloween also.We loved it!"
535,5,18-Aug,United Kingdom,Loved it!,"I love Disney (only been to Paris previously) and Tokyo Disney did not disappoint! We went on a Friday whilst it was busy the queues for most rides where manageable. The shops sell such cute quirky merchandise. We saw the night parade and it was amazing, loved every minute of our time there!"
536,5,18-Sep,Thailand,Fantastic Time,"Tokyo Disneyland opened its gates 35 years ago. I do remember well as I was part of the chorus that sang the Its a Small World during the opening ceremony. Now being in my mid-forties, never did I thought I would be coming back. Dreading the long queues and exorbitant prices, honestly, I was not looking forward to this visit; however, my wife wanted to experience it. No need upsetting ones wife. Now that I have visited the park, I have to say, I enjoyed it thoroughly. A day prior to the end of the summer holidays and residual wind from a massive typhoon, the park was not too busy. Average wait time for a popular ride was approximately 35 minutes (versus 150 minutes). Not too bad I say. My assistant who is a Disney fan informed me after the fact that days after a typhoon for generally quiet. The rides were all I. Japanese but this did not lower the hype (after all you are in Japan). The Haunted Mansion was decked out with a Halloween motif which added a nice touch. Food was slightly on the steep end but was not so bad. My wife and I were quite excited with the cute popcorn buckets (at my age that is a miracle). Disney magic basically shot my heart back into my youth. Yes, the park can be busy at times but if you plan it right you might be lucky like us. I strongly suggest you buy tickets in advance. I hope this review helped. "
537,4,18-Aug,United Kingdom,Excellent - mlike Florida Magic Kingdom,"Had to call in, didn't get to Disney Sea next door. main street is covered over which is great in hot or wet weather. Familiar layout and rides. Very busy but still got on most rides .very easy to get to from central Tokyo , about 25 minutes on a good train right to the door.Downside was poor choice of food in the quick eats cafes, very limited choice and poor quality based on what we did at. Didn't seem as many outlets as in the USA parks or even Paris. virtually no quick food carts other than popcorn Carts in the park."
538,4,18-Aug,N/A,Good day out,"Don't make the mistake of going at a weekend. We went on a week day in August (Japanese school holidays) and possibly during the national holiday of Obon week. Got lucky as we arrived and 9.30....after the park had already been open 1.5hrs and walked straight in - no queues! We even still managed to get Monsters Inc fast passes. Not been to the California/Florida parks but this park was certainly much nicer than Disneyland Paris. The staff were super friendly and, although they did not speak too much English, tried to help us at any opportunity. A good day out and worth the money. "
539,4,18-Sep,Australia,Fun day out,Disneyland is lots of fun but be sure to make the most of the free fast pass as lines can get quite long.Use the map as the place itself is not as well sign posted as other Disneyland‚Äôs are. If you can go on a weekday as it gets very busy
540,4,18-Aug,Australia,busy,very busy. you will spnd hours to get in line for a game. No hlala food in the area and I would never go back again especially in the summer
541,5,18-Sep,Singapore,Use TDRalert App to check the long waiting times including FASTPASS timing. Avoid weekends and holidays as many famil,"If going only 1 day, plan the timing to play the popular rides. Lots of Japanese families visit this great place. Queue earlier to wait for park to open and plan time till night closing. If stay at Disney hotels, can get pass to enter park earlier by 30 minutes. "
542,5,18-Sep,N/A,Fun theme park,It was fun at Disneyland. We spend 5 hours without knowing. Nothing can make you bore here. Hunted mansion is the best ride ever. We love Pop corn bucket so much. We will back as soon as possible. 
543,4,18-Jul,United States,A good representation of Disney,"Tokyo Disney is like California Disneyland, one of the happiest places on earth.  I bought my tickets online for my daughter and myself and printed them out.  Tokyo Disney is cheaper than Disneyland or Disneyworld.  As a Disney lover, it was comforting to see most of the elements of Disneyland here.  They are doing some construction for new attractions, probably in time for the 2020 Olympics.  Japanese people seem like more avid Disney fans than Americans.  If you have the time, I recommend going."
544,5,17-Oct,Australia,AWESOME DISNEYLAND,Wow the Japanese really know how to do Disneyland. Everything is super clean and everyone is very polite and helpful. I really enjoyed it as a lot of the rides are the same as Disneyland in Anaheim. If you are a Disney fan I can‚Äôt recommend going to Tokyo Disneyland and Disneysea enough. Do yourself a favour. I went in October which was a great time to go if you enjoy Halloween as the theming is excellent. 
545,4,18-Aug,China,"Great atmosphere, great staff, very crowded","We did our visit on a Monday, early in August.  Despite a typhoon warning, the place was packed.  By 10:00 am, most of the lines were 100 to 130 minutes long.  Most of the fast passes were gone by 2 pm.  The park was very clean, and the staff was incredibly friendly.  We were impressed by the staff."
546,5,18-Aug,Thailand,Disneyland Tokyo,I visited Disneyland on 24th August 2018. It‚Äôs the best time and it‚Äôs 35 happiest celebration of them. Everyone was wore anniversary shirt. I played a few base. It was too long and fully of people came.
547,5,18-Aug,United Arab Emirates,A fantastic end to my holiday!,"As I huge fan of Disney parks I really enjoyed my day at Tokyo Disney.  It was hot and busy but I got there early and was able to get on several rides- using Fastpass for Big Thunder Mountain as the line was already v long at 8.30am.  There were plenty of helpful cast members, and lots of tasty food on offer, although the popcorn lines got very long!  If you want to go to the Queen of Hearts banquet hall try mid afternoon- there was no line at 4pm but the place was crazy at 11.30am!  Make sure to try the lottery for the shows- I was lucky enough to get a front row seat for the superb 'One Man's Dream II!'   The merchandise is also amazing so make sure to save time for shopping in the Emporium before the evening parades.  A great day!"
548,3,18-Aug,United States,Be Prepared Or Just Skip It,"Wasted day, though it was our fault. We should have been more prepared for the lines - yes, they are as long as people say. This park gets almost as many visitors as Orlando + Anaheim combined, while I believe it's about the same size. We made the mistake of going somewhat spur of the moment, without an advance plan for Fast Pass. I wouldn't recommend doing that, every attraction had lines of 80+ minutes. (One tip, at Splash Mountain you can ride as singles - we told them that at the Fast Pass line and they let us walk through - basically skipping the whole line). Otherwise, though, you're waiting well over an hour for what is usually a 5-minute ride. Separate from the lines, I thought Pooh's Honey Hunt was one of the more creative rides we'd been on. Food options in the park weren't very impressive. It would have been nice if they had free wi-fi (or any wi-fi!) in the park, especially since you're spending so much time just waiting in line."
549,5,18-Mar,Thailand,Superb! ,A bit crowed and the queue is quite long. Most restaurants are full during lunch and dinner. You should pack some for your own or eat at the off peak hours. Parades are superb! Kids enjoy themselves a lot.
550,5,18-Jun,Thailand,Tokyo Disneyland- A wonderful day with my daughter,"What a great experience! I spent a wonderful day with my 15 year old daughter at Tokyo Disneyland. We both were impressed about the many activities offered in this huge park, but also about the crowd of people. It was a great day for both of us, a beautiful place where young and old can enjoy a wonderful day."
551,5,18-Jul,Australia,Loved it!,"We love Disney parks, and have been to several all over the world. Tokyo Disneyland and Disney Sea continued this trend!I would recommend staying at one of the hotels on the monorail (about 8 or so to choose from). It makes it very easy to get around to the 2 parks, as well as to the Downtown Disney area Ikspiari.Vegetarians will have a tough time finding food - we only saw 2 places (1 counter service and 1 sit down) that had vegetarian options other than just french fries or a very plain lettuce salad. Food was mostly reasonably priced.It can be very busy - make use of fastpasses.There were plenty of shopping opportunities, shows, parades, etc.Disneyland was a typical Disney park - happy, clean, exciting, colourful, friendly... loved it and would absolutely recommend!"
552,2,18-Aug,N/A,Crowded and expect very long waiting times,Went on a Friday and frankly VERY disappointing. All rides and attractions were 1 hour plus waiting times and for small kids simply not worth it in the heat and humidity. Will only go again when the children are much bigger and at a non peak time. 
553,4,18-Aug,United Kingdom,Once in a lifetime ,"I‚Äôll save all the praise and gratitude to how we had a wonderful day here, as there are more than enough online already. I just want to say that the one star off was for the parade. There‚Äôs just too many people and it‚Äôs impossible for young children to see anything at the back, nor is it humane to ask children to wait for hours to be in the front line."
554,5,18-Aug,Vietnam,Disneyland around the word!,"First international Disneyland and was impressed! Things are done over the top and adds the same Disney magic as the other parks in the US. Lines can be very long and hot, come prepared. Watched a show/parade on Main Street in front of the castle that was excellent! World bazaar with shops and restaurants as your first walk into the park is the unique part of this Disneyland (covered roof of it rains). Paired this with DisneySea, if you want to do one then you have to do both!"
555,5,18-Feb,Singapore,Magical and Happiest Place in the World,Highly recommend to spend one day in DisneySEA. The park is always crowded with really happy people wearing hats! Also the queue for rides are crazy; queues up to 2 hours or more and I highly recommend to take the express passes. Food in the park are quite pricey but you can bring your own food to have a nice picnic as there are many areas to sit down and eat.
556,4,18-Aug,N/A,One day is enough,"1, Suggest don't go on the weekend;2, Can purchase at the gate;3, Once you get in, go get all the possible Fast Track: Small little world, The Mountain ride etc. I think Fast Track stops at 16.30 or 40. Make sure arrange your time accordingly.4, Disney world is small, very easy to walk to each land, one day is total enough. We arrived the Disney land by subway around 9 on Monday. Got our ticket around 9.30. By 6pm afternoon we already went on 14 rides/ shows/ Theaters.5, Some area there's some English speaking staff, and they're always ready to help."
557,5,17-Oct,N/A,Great place.,"We went to both Disneyland and Disney Sea, one day in each. Both were great but Disney Sea is much better for teens and adults. As expected food and shopping is very expensive inside, you are allowed to bring your own food and drinks to both parks. The Indiana Jones ride was probably my favorite."
558,4,17-Oct,Australia,A family Place,What can I say.... Disneyland in Tokyo is a welcoming beautiful place to be with family. It exhuberates fun and enjoyment. It‚Äôs a very miniature version of the original but it entails all the pleasures that Disney brings to all hearts.
559,3,18-Aug,N/A,Should improve English.,"We are a Spanish couple and we were visiting Dineyland and Disney Sea two days few days ago. We had to wait almost 40 minutes  to get our ""lottery seats"" because no one could help us since they didn't speak English. I have to say that staff were kind and tried to help us by using a translator app (but it was pretty bad and the words did not make sense).At the end, one boy with a fluent English could help us and solve the problem in 2 minutes.We had the same problem in both parks when you asked for some info. Moreover, it was a quite disappointing to loose part of the attractions (such as videos, intros...)because they were only in japanese...it could be a good idea to mix both Japanese and English (we only had subtitles in Minions attraction) Moreover, the duration of the attractions is so so so short. In other hand, I have to say that both parks were soooo clean. Amazing job and kind staff but these are two of the most important parks in the world and from our opinion, English should be taken into account since they receive people from all over the world."
560,4,18-Apr,Indonesia,Happiest place ,"Went there in April, and its their 35th years celebration and easter too..So the costume they wear is quite unique..I always enjoy Disneyland..Most of the attractions are for kids compare to DisneySea..Unfortunately, when we went there the closing time is 5pm because of some private party..We didn‚Äôt get to see the parade and fireworksSo please do check before going!Queuing time for taking photos with the characters is very long and sometimes its quite hectic..I queued for 40 minutes to take picture with Mickey only..Another 1 hour for Minnie ..Its always fun to come to Disneyland but I prefer Disneysea tho.. "
561,4,18-Jul,Australia,Loved it,"We only had one day so decided on Disney Sea. and loved it. easy to get around, typical long lines for rides though you can book a time for a fast entry if you have more time this is a better option. loved Journey to the Centre of The Earth, The Nautalis Ride and the Coaster I suggest at least two full days, stay at one of the Disney Resorts if your budget can afford it and avoid school holidays and late July/August in the extreme heat it can be quite exhausting! Lots of fun for all ages, very accessible has a railway station almost at the entry gate."
562,4,18-Apr,Australia,Tokyo Disney,So easy to get to and the park is set out fabulously - not as over crowded like Anaheim (my husband even enjoyed it)The parade at the end was spectacular and not to be missed and don't forget to get popcorn for the train ride back to your hotel if you're not staying at Disneyland.Still dreaming of that popcorn ...
563,5,18-Jun,Indonesia,First time in the magic kingdom,"This is my first time in a Disney's park and I was having fun in every step.From the ticket gate we went to train station to ride Disney's train. It's a short ride but we love it. Entering the Disneyland park we were thrill with every aspect. There're bag check before entering (empty bottles and empty Disney's popcorn container are welcome). Disney's officers are so nice even we then check bags. We straight walked to the ticket check and went to first fast past booth...Monster.Inc üòäWe went on Wednesday in summer so it wasn't as crowded as weekend.Disney's parade are magical. For parade schedules and routes you have to get Disney's map at Ticket check gate. They have almost all language for map.We had our lunch at 11.00 am so the restaurant was not crowded. The food is also good.There are a lot of cold water dispenser station (inside a restaurant) so you can always fill your tumbler at any time. Bottled drink vending machine are available but their price is higher than outside vending machine, so it's better to bring your tumbler and refill to safe money for snacks and souvenirs.The rides were magical, clean, with moderate que.Souvenirs shops are everywhere but different zone can have different products so be sure to check out every souvenir shops if you search for a special theme.Steam boat ride are definitely a must try to relax your feet after running around the park. "
564,5,17-Dec,Philippines,Happiest Place on Earth,"Every child is dreaming to see or to visit Disneyland. Some are lucky to make it and some are not. But for me it takes 30 years before it was happened. Last December 2017 as part of my 30th birthday , i had a chance to visit Disneyland . It seems like every moments i was there is just a dream. I was really teary eyed while watching the disney parade seeing Mickey Kouse and Minnie Mouse dancing gracefully with other disney characters . I tried the Space Mountain and it was great . I guess you need to stay for 2 days to enjoy the park or better to get a Fast Pass to manage your time to try all the rides. There was also a parade at night and make sure to see it. I was a lil‚Äô bit disappointed coz i didnt witnessed the Fireworks due to strong winds and the park decided to cancel it. "
565,5,18-Jul,United Kingdom,Another great day out at Tokyo Disneyland,"I‚Äôve been going to Tokyo Disneyland since I was a little girl and have come back with my own kids over the years. Still a great place to visit! Some tips for visiting Tokyo Disneyland in summer;- If possible, visit before kids break up for the summer (about the third week of July), avoid the public holidays and choose a weekday. The forecast for how busy place may be can be found online. - Buy tickets in a convenient store in advance. We purchased ours in Family Mart a couple of days before. You can buy them the day before and that would save you queuing for tickets on the day. - Get there early! - Buses are frequent and handy. We travelled from Yokohama by bus and it took us right up to the entrance and fare was very reasonable. - Officially you are not allowed to take in any food or drinks of your own food within the park, but flasks for cold drinks would be ok and handy in the park especially if visiting in summer. Get your kids to carry one each across their shoulder to keep them hydrated and avoid heat stroke in the sun! - Use fastpass to your advantage! They go very quickly, most places go early on and once they run out there will be no fastpasses. Remember that some attractions turn over is quicker than others, for example, Star Tours, It‚Äôs A Small Word etc have large capacity for a each ride so the que move quickly so no need for the pass. - People tend to watch parades so ques are not as long for those times. Enjoy the magic kingdom!"
566,5,18-Jul,Australia,A full 12 hours spent here,"This was an excellent theme park and everything was organised very well. Get there early, if you enjoy the rides you really do need all day. "
567,4,18-Jul,United Kingdom,Disney,Great day out. We had a go on all the rides. A very happy place. All you need for the kids and couples in this iconic place. It is a must do thing if you are a disney fan.
568,4,18-Jul,Australia,Disney Sea,Its a big day - lots of rides but only 5 that were described as 'good' by 16 year old.  3d shows etc are in Japanese so were not really suitable for us english only family.  Food is good and there a lot of souvenir shops way more than I care for.  
569,4,18-Jul,Singapore,"Despite being a crowded park, it is still very clean and green",It is a Japanese Disneyland where mainly Japanese is spoken. Although it was a weekday when we visited the park was quite packed. But amazingly the park is very well maintained and clean; including the toilets! The street parade shows are fantastic and not to be missed. Only disappointment is toonland wasn‚Äôt as good as the original one. Still a good park for family with kids
570,5,18-Jan,N/A,Hands down the best Disneyland,"I tell this to every single one of my annual passholder friends in California, but Tokyo is seriously the best Disneyland out there and blows Anaheim out of the water. The food tastes better. The park is cleaner. The ticket prices are much cheaper. The Disney hats, hairbands, and clothes are cuter. I mean what's not to like? Definitely splurge for a popcorn bucket as soon as you get there. They're pricey (I think my Star Wars one was over 3000 yen), but so cute and everyone has one. You should make sure to try all the different seasonal popcorn flavors as well. The different flavors and specific popcorn stands are on the park map, so don't get lost and try them all!"
571,5,17-Aug,France,Special Disneyland ,This Disneyland is really special as it is the only who got a protection from the rain on its main avenue. I went to many Disneyland to take the same picture as the ‚Äúsame‚Äù spot and this Disneyland was perfect for that.
572,5,17-Oct,N/A,Childhood Dream came true !!,Loved the place.Most of the Asian visitors were wearing Disney characters' custom. A lot of things to do but in some games you have to wait in the queue for a very long time .The restaurants does not offer variety of dishes. They need to offer Halal foods or vegan options.Most of games are in Japanese. 
573,5,18-Jul,United Kingdom,The Best Disney in the World!,"I have visited every Disney park in the world and this has to the best!! We went for the 35th celebration and omg it was the most magical thing I've ever experienced! In world bazaar they have a beautiful statue which plays music, all the rides are amazing and characters! The show at night time is the best, it made me cry! The food is the best at any Disney park I have ever been too, amazingly themed and so tasty! Most of all its the staff which make this park so magical...The most friendliest cast members at any Disney park they really are a credit to the Walt Disney Company, it would be wonderful if the same standard could be applied to all Disney's hint hint Shanghai"
574,5,18-Jun,United States,fun family time,"We had a lot of fun  It is less crowded than Disneyland in California, USA.  Some of the rides are different.  Star Tours was great!  Space Montain is a roller coaster with three loops!  And Indiana Jones is a coaster with one loop."
575,5,17-Aug,Japan,Great day out!,"A great day out for all ages. Have been there on school holidays and it was packed. Only got to go on about 5 rides because of the long cues. Second time I found out about express tickets that you can get a few hours in advance and then you don't need to wait in line. You can also get a cheaper ticket for just the evenings. They have some cool parades, illuminations and fireworks. The smoked turkey legs are amazing!!"
576,5,18-Jul,N/A,Awesome Parks who designed well to entertain families...,"This park is awesome to entertain your family with themes from some famaous disney movies like pirates of caribbean...worth to visit specially at Summer time..You can use train, bus or taxi from tokyo where train is the cheapest way to get there"
577,5,18-Jul,Australia,Always Great Fun,"Tokyo Disney and its sister park Disney Sea are by and far the best of Disneys's parks around the world - so clean and efficient - but always very busy as they are so popular with the Japanese locals.This was our 4th visit, taking our 10 year old Niece on her 9th visit to the park."
578,5,18-Jul,United States,Great Fun,The park is spread out - but worth the heat and humidity.  Again there was great customer service - and people there were very friendly.  It is the 35 year anniversary so it was special.
579,5,18-Jul,South Korea,Never Old for Fun and Games,"My friend wanted to go, so said why not‚Ä¶Glad I did! I even got Minnie Mouse ears and wore them all day/night.  Man, you are never too old to for fun and games.  Although the rides, or rather, experiences, are in Japanese with some English, it was still a lot of fun.  My favorite was the Starwars, the adventure continues episode ride/experience.  The scene was so darn cool, even waiting in line was a blast.  Lots of props, talking/moving animatronics to take pictures of. The experience is a 3D flight through space on a space vessel. Worth it. Ate at the Alice in Wonderland, Queen of Hearts of restaurant.  Again, another cool scene with awesome d√©cor, worthy of my camera. The park is huge, and although there aren‚Äôt many ride experiences for adults, kids would definitely enjoy it! There were too many parents with kids who will not remember the visit‚Ä¶parents were definitely there for themselves ^.^ Lots of young couples, great for fun, childish, but supper cute date."
580,5,18-Jul,Australia,Magical Fairytale Land,"A truly magical experience and despite long queues, most moved quite quickly with staff ensuring that everything was done efficiently and orderly.  The park is extremely big but conveniently located to Disneysea."
581,5,18-Jul,N/A,Paradise for kids,"We spent 1 full day, 9 am to 10pm, and hardly finished half, so take at least 2 days pass to see it all. Very organized and the staff is very excited to help. A must place to be for all families with kids.One advice, purchase the fast pass, you then don't need wait in Q as anyone else. "
582,5,18-Jul,Australia,Check it out ,This was my first time at this Disneyland Park after visiting Disneyland California 3 times.Cast members were happy to assist me even though I can‚Äôt speak Japanese fluently.Rides were similar like it‚Äôs a small world.But splash mountain exceeded my expectations at this park.I was lucky to have one of the cast members hand me my phone after forgetting it on the restaurant table and then going outside to give my phone back to me outside Grandma Sarah‚Äôs restaurant.So thank you.
583,4,18-Jul,Philippines,If You Love Disney this Place is for You,"we were coming to japan for a holiday and since i have a 5 yr old son, i thought very appropriate to book for disney land...  Everything was as expected, being a fan of Universal Studios i cannot help but compare it from rides to attraction and the like.  My son did have fun and we took 5 rides in total, 1 day is not enough though.  Since we were not able to get fast pass as they run out early on that day, 1 ride can take 60-80 minutes in queueing.  I also chose the day where moderate crowd was expected (32K) but still it was so crowded and tiring.  the fact that we visited in a summer also didnt help..."
584,5,18-Jul,United States,Awesome Disney Experience.,Has all of the main things you would expect from Disneyland in the States.  Food more reasonable than in the States.  As always great Disney service.  Kids are already asking to go again!
585,5,18-Jun,United States,"If you love Disney, you have to go.","If you're not a Japanese speaker, you can thoroughly enjoy this park.  However, I would say you'll enjoy it the most if you've been to the US parks first as an English speaker.  I've been to Tokyo Disneyland three times now, and I've enjoyed every visit.  I enjoy visiting because I have enough history and context with the US parks to look for the differences and enjoy some of the cultural nuances of the Japanese park compared to Disneyland and the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World. The most recent visit was the first time I took my kids, and I noticed the same from them.  They enjoyed seeing the rides unique to Japan, and how other rides may have been tweaked from their US counterparts.  The park is everything you'd expect from a Disney experience otherwise, and their unique seasonal celebrations are wonderful.  We got to experience the Star Festival on this most recent trip, but their Halloween decor is also phenomenal.  And they've really gone all out for the 35th Anniversary decor as well.  Looking forward to visiting again in the future, when many of the projects under way now are finally complete!"
586,5,18-Jun,Ireland,A must do for Disney lovers!,"My husband and I are big Disney fans (ok, me a little more so) and we spent a day of our time in Tokyo at Disneyland.  We both thoroughly enjoyed the park - there are lots of nice touches here you don‚Äôt get in Orlando or California - including some really tasty food options- be sure to try the different popcorn flavours!The park is easily accessible from central Tokyo by train and we found prices on the gate to be very reasonable.  The parade featured some nice Japanese cultural touches and we found the cast members to be really great - there is a lot of Disney magic here.  Visitors to Orlando will find that Tokyo don‚Äôt do single rider lines - except for splash mountain.  We wanted to ride Big Thunder Mountain but when we got there and asked about single rider, we were told they didn‚Äôt have the facility.  At that point we did t have 90mins to wait to ride, so we headed towards the exit- the cast member followed us and stopped us and said she wanted to offer some pixie dust by giving us a fast pass so we could ride.  This really made our day and we enjoyed the ride before leaving.If you have visited other Disney parks, make sure you give Tokyo a visit - you won‚Äôt regret it."
587,5,18-Jul,N/A,The perfect mix of Disneyland in California and Magic Kingdom in Florida  ,After visiting all the Disney parks in the world I found this one to be the most unique and charming. Although there are many similarities most attractions are the original versions of themselves. It took me back to my childhood. It was amazing to see the attractions how I remembered them. While most of the other Disney parks have updated their attractions Tokyo Disneyland has not. I personally loved this aspect. I cannot express how much I enjoyed this park and can not wait to go back. 
588,5,18-Jul,Australia,Amazing birthday for our son,The cast members at all parks do a great job making guests feel welcome and my son who turned 5 on the day we visited just could not figure out why the whole park wanted high 5s and saying happy birthday. He is a 5 yr old with autism and he was the happiest little guy all day because he was feeling so special. The park itself has a few changes from the Anaheim original. There is a world bazaar replacing main street. It is undercover which is great especially in the summer heat. There lands are organized differently but most of the rides from Anaheim are here. The only ride I would recommend getting a fast pass early is space mountain. This ride consistently had the longest lines (2hr+) from the summer crowd. There wasn't a ride in the park my son could not ride he is 105cm. The park has some really good eats. Try the waffle and fried chicken sandwich at the woodchuck lodge in westernland. I did enjoy the parks slight changes and you will do a lot of walking so try one of the really lovely tropical slushies. Do try some of the interesting flavors of popcorn too. The park is immaculate and clean. I really loved our time and would do it again.
589,4,18-Jul,New Zealand,Fantasy land for children and adults ,"Great representation of Disney‚Äôs characters with all the Color, Glamour and Glitz of the original Disney land in USATokyo Disney land runs like a Swiss clock , the presentation of themes are out of this world. A must see is the Pirates of the Caribbean ride and the River Cruze. The attention to detail on the props are outstanding. There are no long lines in Tokyo , unlike Hong Kong Disney lines move faster than the indicated wait. Tokyo Disney land focuses on smaller but larger capacity rides such as the river boat , and the river cruise to prevent frustration and long waiting time. The end result is more value for money as a Day Pass means you could cover the park in 6-7 hours This park suits children mainly under 12 and whilst there are faster rides the whole experience is stress free A must see in Tokyo "
590,5,18-Jun,Qatar,Happiest place for kids and kids alike,"Tokyo Disney Resort is our 2nd Disney experience. Compared to HK, the staff here are more polite and much nicer and friendly. The guests are kind, majority are adult giving way to kids and elderlies. They are also more orderly with their restaurants and very clean restrooms.The park is very much accessible through hotel bus service or Maihama Stn. "
591,4,18-Jul,Norway,Wonderful and clean resort ,"We spent one saturday at Disneyland with one child age 6 and one teen. It was one of the hottest and most crowded days, but everything is so organized that it was still a good experience. Being jet-lagged we skipped the morning and opted for the ¬´go on rides with shortest waiting-time tactic¬ª. It worked,and we managed to get 2 fastpasses even though it was 2pm and we took 10 rides. If you want to avoid lines for the restaurants,stay clear of eating between 12-13 and 18-19. On hot days choose afternoon/evening visit. Try the Star Wars dumplings, Mickey Waffels and the Queen of hearts/Alice in Wonderland buffet. Worth it! Also don‚Äôt miss the night-time spectacular at 20.00. "
592,5,18-Jun,United States,Fun fun fun!,"Tokyo Disneyland is an incredible theme park. We went during their Disney's Easter celebrations and had a blast. Their Usatama parade is so catchy and fun, make sure to check it out. The food is delicious and their limited edition merchandise can't be beat. Fun Disney staples as well as Disneyland-exclusive rides. Make sure to ride Pooh's Hunny Hunt and the Monsters Inc ride, both are exclusive to TDR. Fun tip, they have a lot of popcorn carts with awesome flavors, such as soy sauce-flavored popcorn. If you can't speak Japanese, there is a lot of written English and they will give you an English map when you buy your ticket. Some of the staff may speak some English to you, but most will not. I do suggest you do some research before you go."
593,4,18-Apr,United States,Fun Day at Disney!,"This park was really fun!  It was helpful to watch vlogs on YouTube before our trip to help us plan our day and get Fast Passes.  Definitely utilize this system and the single rider lines if you can.  It was a little odd that some of the rides/attractions were in English and some in Japanese.  The staff was all friendly and helpful.  I loved the flavored popcorn carts and found a few vegetarian options.  The app isn't as efficient as apps for Disney parks in the United States, so if you are used to having that convenience you may want to plan a bit in advance.  We were able to ride everything we wanted to in one day.  Definitely a fun treat!  My only suggestion is that they add more vegetarian food options.  There were only a few in the park. "
594,5,18-Jan,Australia,Wonderful theme park,"Tokyo Disneyland is incredibly fun. It is perfectly maintained, clean, fun and so much to do. The Pooh's Hunny Pot ride is unlike any other, the best theme park ride I have been on. The parades are excellent, especially the Electrical Dream lights. I don't think I could ever have enough time for these parks. I recommend starting your day with grabbing some fast passes then heading to the Great American Waffle co for the best Mickey Waffles I have had anywhere."
595,5,18-Jul,Indonesia,One day is not enough ,"Seriously though, we don‚Äôt have enough time to explore all the attractions, the waiting line sometime waste a lot of time. The top rides like mountain splash, space mountain could took 30-90 minutes waiting time. But sure it was a wonderful day to be spend with your family. If you want satisfied enough to enjoy all the rides book 2 day ticket. And make it 3 day for another day at Disneysea. "
596,4,18-Jul,Australia,Good place to have fun,"Great place. You only have to look lost for a second and a smiling friendly staff member will hasten over to help. Even if they were in the middle of cleaning up.The only negative is the fast pass system which is a freezer time limited system. By the last ride it was quicker to wait in the normal line than it was to get a ""fast pass""Keep that in mind when deciding on which rides to go on first.All in all a good day"
597,5,18-Jul,N/A,Amazing ,"This really was where magic came to life!Tokyo Disneyland is truly amazing.. Getting from akihabara to Disneyland was quite easy & very well sign posted. Once at the station, it‚Äôs a short walk to the entrance.We brought our tickets at the park, and there was no line (we arrived around 10am.) Once inside it kinda takes your breath away!All Staff was incredibly friendly & happy to help with anything. I would advise to get fast passes as we waited over 1hr 30min for splash mountain (which was worth it)Be prepared for a lot of smiling & waving, as every staff member you meet is waving at you ‚ò∫Ô∏è. The night parade is definitely worth watching!!"
598,4,18-Apr,Malaysia,Disneyland is DISNEYLAND!,Honestly.. comparatively.. objectively.. nothing beats Disney Florida‚ù§Ô∏èThe rides were hair raising.. the variety is wider..The one thing Disney excels everywhere would be the parade.. it was beautifully choreographed esp Wendy and Peter at the endüßöüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
599,1,18-Jul,United States,Just rude,"  We‚Äôre in day three of the Tokyo Disneyland parks, and I can‚Äôt believe how rude the staff is. Letting what appear to be friends on rides in front of waiting guest. Refusing to attempt to make reservations for restaurants. And just flat out ignoring guest questions.   I‚Äôm sure that this isn‚Äôt the norms based on other reviews. But we are very disappointed in this Disney location. "
600,5,18-Mar,Australia,HAPPINESS IS HERE in abundance ! Restore your faith in ..... FUN !,"Disneyland TOKYO BAY JAPAN. Winter 2017&18 SUNSHINE & RAINBegin with - One man's Dream ‚Äì An Amazing show with many Favourite Disney CharactersOn my most recent visit to Disneyland it rained consistently all day & was cold so we were in full ski gear jackets and pants so we could still get around the park and onto rides without carrying umbrellas & because of this the ride queues were quick the park was not full. At around 530pm we walked straight onto STAR TOURS & SPACE MOUNTAIN big ride attractions no waiting & which I have queued in Best weather conditions 2017 about 45-60mins THAT WAS AWESOME. These rides are ""OUT OF THIS WORLD"" Amazing!All parades were cancelled. Obviously Dream lights - night time parade could not go ahead in rain. I did see it last year in 2017 & it is truly gobsmacking magical visual experience and a good time to take a rest- don‚Äôt miss it if weather permits. There are many vantage points though having the castle as the backdrop is essential for most. There are brand new daytime Parades ""Dreaming up"" & Sansui Summer Beat these are really fun highlights of the day.This year it seemed there was a lot of works going on too. A large area was undergoing installation of new attractions. SPLASH MOUNTAIN & Haunted Castle was closed for maintenance. To avoid disappointment & in planning your visit - check website for attraction maintenance & closures. Check the weather radar too ‚Äúknow what's coming‚Äù weatherwise is a good idea too.Our day just got wetter and wetter, the crowds did not endure and I found myself riding on many previously missed rides Buzz lightyear Astro blasters - Pirates of the Caribbean - Poohs honey hunt, was cute. Snow Whites Adventures the Western River railroad the Jungle cruise wildlife expeditions - We loved it all!So there are advantages to perceived bad weather.  Staying at a DISNEY Resort Hotel enabled us to return twice to our room, to change clothes, as the conditions changed - freshen up and return to the park. DISNEY Resort hotels have a Disney resort liner coach to transport you from the monorail to your hotel lobby so at no time were we left out in the rain and cold.It's Fun Friendly & fresh atmosphere at Tokyo Bay Disneyland ‚Ä¶. everyone is happy!  A really great place to be !Such Great days i will never forget ! Thankyou to the entire cast and crew of Tokyo Bay Disney Resort. Making dreams come true...."
601,4,18-Jun,Australia,Very Disneyland ,"Although I have never been to a Disneyland before, have to say that this place lived up to its reputation to the letter. Rides were great, queues were long for those who couldn‚Äôt figure out or afford the fast pass system. Quite the money spinner for them! Parades were spectacular, especially the night one, but the fireworks were unfortunately cancelled due to the weather. Food prices were also quite acceptable. Understanding that this is based in Japan and probably 99% or more of the people were Japanese, it was frustrating that all the rides had no English spoken in them. Now I would have thought that these days that some sort of Bluetooth translation system would have been available for those rides that had spoken dialogue within it. But anyway. Be prepared for s long day, we were there for 13 hours!"
602,5,18-Jul,N/A,Every time in Tokyo,"Every time we visit we go to Tokyo Disney. The lines are small, there are no angry white people and kids are super cute. The food and drink are normal, not inflated prices and the rides are amazing. So worth the day out there."
603,5,18-Apr,Australia,Disneyland Japan a must to go to!,"It was awesome, we were told that Disney Sea was better however we managed to experience both parks and the family had a ball of fun.  The parade was specular.  The park was so organised we managed to experience a number of rides.We can't wait to go back."
604,5,18-Jun,N/A,May be my favorite Disney,"As someone who has now visited all of the Disney Parks throughout the world, this may be my favorite!  The lines seemed to be reasonable lengths (we stayed for 3 days at the end of June).  The cast members were the friendliest/most enthusiastic of any Disney employees I've ever met.  Everyone genuinely seemed to enjoy the park and the magic and their job.  It was truly magical!  The main street is the most unique of all as it is covered and in the mornings they had a confetti party which my kids loved.  Disney Sea was also a favorite as it is also very different from other Disney parks. Loved all the unique apparel and items.  Sizing is funky so if you're plus sized or taller you will have trouble finding a shirt/clothes that fit but for kids and average/small adults everything is very bright and unique!  Overall a great experience and we can't wait to go back!"
605,5,18-Jul,United States,The best park in Japan.,"Japan really love Disneyland! Even many Chinese, Taiwanese visit here! Hope many people in East Asia love American culture.I used JR Keiyo-line.It is easy to go to Disneyland from Maihama station.I visited on Monday July 3rd 2018 at 10am.There were still many people.I bought my tickets at 7-11 convenience store.You buy tickets online.I love rides.I really enjoyed jungle cruise and Pirates of the Caribbean.There are 6 area in Tokyo Disney.I loved Westernland.I really enjoyed Western River Railroad, Mark Twain Riverboat and Tom Sawyer Islands rift.They are must-go rides.I saw a parade.July 7th is "" Japanese Tanabata day"" I saw Mickey and Minnie Mouse.They had Tanabata costume on Japanese rickshaw.This was very Japanese style.There were many restaurants.You may eat Japanese-American mix food such as Hamburg steak.Disney Casts were so friendly and nice.They were the best in the world.They were always smiling to us! I was glad to see that many Japanese and Asians enjoyed Tokyo Disneyland.Please visit here!"
606,5,18-Jun,United Kingdom,AMAZING!,"So much fun for kids and adults alike. If you‚Äôre a big Disney lover, you must try it! It‚Äôs very similar to all other Disney parks of course, with the odd quirky Japanese touch. We went on a ‚Äòquiet‚Äô day however and queued for two hours for splash mountain! Get the fast pass tickets - we didn‚Äôt and we really should have done! Still managed to get on over 10 attractions and enjoy the day. Food is very pricey, take snacks! "
607,4,18-Jun,N/A,It was fun!,"Disneyland is fun.  I enjoyed it with my children.  The fast passes help to skip waiting times on rides.  I would have spent a longer day there, but my children were tired. "
608,5,18-Jul,N/A,The friendly Disney anywhere.,"I have been to Disneyland (USA), Disney California Adventure, Disneyworld (USA) and Epcot Center (USA), Disneyland Singapore, Disneyland Hong Kong, and this is hands down the friendliest and cleanest park. What the park lacks in rides compared to others, is made up with the staff that never stop smiling or waving. The park itself is spotless. From the grounds, to the toilets, everything is spotless, without fail. The people are polite, never saw someone push in a line, which I cant say about any of the others.  The light show at 8.00pm was breathtaking. never seen anything else that comes close. The only thing that seems to be missing is the lack of characters that other parks seem to have on tap. Had one brief opportunity, and that was by pure luck. Toontown under construction, so things should improve with the rides."
609,2,18-Jul,N/A,Beware plus sized travelers ,"Tokyo Disney is as beautiful as all of Disneyland parks, but not as accommodation for all travelers. My wife and I are ‚Äúplus sized‚Äù individuals. As such, we were turned away outright from Space Mountain and we were questioned on our ability to have the safety bar come down at Thunder Mountain. To be fair, in both cases the concern was for our safety and comfort, but the fact remains that we could not ride on attractions included in the cost of admission. I have not encountered these issues at Disney World last summer nor at Disneyland the year before. For those larger than the average Japanese individual, be aware that Tokyo Disney may not be the best fit for you. We "
610,2,17-Aug,United Kingdom,Not a Safe Place to Visit If You Have Allergies!!,"I hate writing this review because,  in general, I have had amazing experiences with Disney worldwide.  But an experience we had at the Tokyo Disneyland park really disappointed and disturbed me.  I was traveling with my family and friends.  We are a French/ American family.  Our friends are a Japanese / French family.   My Japanese friend had booked tickets and organized everything for our days at Tokyo Disney.We knew, going in, that there was no real WiFi at the park.  So we took the initiative to buy WiFi units.  Despite this, our party ended up getting separated into 2 groups who couldn't find each other.  At some point, my husband and I took our kids and my Japanese friend with us on a ride.  Her 9-year-old son didn't want to go on the ride, so he stayed with my mother in law.   When we came off the ride, my very responsible mother in law was nowhere to be found.  As we didn't have the WiFi unit, we had no way to find them.  Luckily, we had prearranged to meet at a particular restaurant.When we got to the restaurant, we learned, to our horror, what happened.  My friend's son had gotten hungry while waiting and so my mother in law got him a chocolate snack.  This boy is allergic to peanuts, but nowhere on the packaging was it mentioned that the ice cream contained peanuts.   Fortunately, my mother in law is a French pediatrician, realized he was having an allergic reaction and took him to the medical center.  Once at the medical center, there was NO ONE on staff who spoke English or French.  Luckily, the boy could speak Japanese.  When he told them what was happening, and that his Epipen was with his mother, they informed him that the didn't have any medicine there to give him for it.  NOTHING FOR A PEANUT ALLERGY!!!  He was told that they would have to go offsite to get something.  Fortunately, his reaction wasn't as severe, and my mother in law got in touch with his father who was able to run offsite to get the pills.   There was no doctor on site. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE for DISNEY!  We have been in the medical offices of several Disney's around the world.  Hong Kong had an actual medical doctor on site.  Walt Disney World has pretty much everything for all emergencies.  So not having something as basic as an Epipen, or some form of Epinephrine is dangerous and negligent for an international amusement park, especially one with as stellar a brand as Disney.  I should also mention that I am celiac, and I had a very difficult time in Tokyo with finding things to eat.  Wheat syrup is hidden in lots of things.  The allergy menu's at Tokyo Disney basically said ""may or may not have"" for almost every entry and every allergen.  It was like their legal department wrote the menu.  I basically just ate food I brought as I was never able to be sure. As the Olympics brings a larger than normal international crowd to Tokyo Disney in 2020, they will need to do better. *  For those those who are tsk tsking about us not having the medicine with us....we did.  But we got separated, as is destined to happen at places like this."
611,5,18-May,India,Great experience.,"This Disney Park is a great to go with kids under 5 also. We went with 2 children and had a blast. Even though everything is in Japanese, the kids were indifferent due to the sheer presentation of things.Kids travel free. The park has several rides which are of interest to kids and adults. You can complete the park in a minimum of a day and maximum of 2 days. Definitely go in a weekday is possible since the crowd is much less. We had a great time. On a Saturday or Sunday the lines get crazy. The waiting on weekends is at least an hour a ride. For people with a fast pass, please go early on a weekend to book your slot for the evening. The parade in the afternoon and the night is unmissable. you have to be there for both. Especially with kids, they love it."
612,4,18-Jul,Indonesia,Tokyo Disneyland - Great time but where are the Character?,"If you been to other Disney properties, you will see a lot of people trying to get to an attraction with ‚ÄúI want to get in with less wait in line‚Äù. Well not here.Everyone is very polite and orderly queing and make the most of it. The staff is very friendly and keep you happily occupied during your stay.One time, this 1 person in front of me queing but needed to go to the restroom, and she asked the staff if she can go. What happen next was the staff stand holding all her bag in the que while she went to the restroom. The staff is happily doing this while chatting with other guest. Can you imagine this in other Disney park? This is what customer service is all about.One thing that really bump us out is that Disney introduce this DUFFY characther that suppose to be Mickey‚Äôs teddy bear.For Disney to introduce new characther is nothing new, but the eliminate almost all the merchandise (the main character) to focus on this new ones is silly.We can hardly find a decent Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck T-shirt.But again, you must visit this park just to tick the box on ‚ÄúBeen There, Done That‚Äù."
613,5,18-Jul,Malaysia,The best Disney so far,"In Japan, you get Disneyland and Disneysea just beside each other. Very convenient and certainly recommend getting a 3 days pass. You choose which Disney you would like to go first 2 days and the last day it‚Äôs up to you to go both if you like. Great way to enjoy any missed or favorite rides again. Like any Disney, always crowded but somehow felt much better compared to Disney Shanghai. Apart from the great thrilling rides, must try‚Äôs are different popcorn flavors, and different chicken and turkey thighs. As usual, family had a blast. Icing on the cake was winning a big Daisy Duck soft toy end of the last day. "
614,5,18-Apr,Sweden,"If you're in Tokyo, make sure to visit Disneyland!","This Disneyland is different from all the other ones, in how it is distinctly Japanese. You'll not be surprised by the rides or the environments, they are very similar to both Disneyland Paris and TMK Orlando, but the way they are run is vastly different. Everything is super clean and during the parades the staff make a great effort to ensure that people can walk around the park. Everyone is very service minded and staff will even ask if they can assist you in taking group photos. (Free of charge, group photos with your own phone etc.)"
615,5,18-Jun,United States,Just Different Enough to be Cool,"So, if you‚Äôve been to WDW Orlando or Disneyland California, then this is a tuned ‚Äúdifferently‚Äù Disney. First thing you will notice is ‚ÄúDuffy‚Äù, that‚Äôs Mickeys teddy bear. Yep, Mickey has a teddy bear named Duffy. And Duffy has friends, Gelatoni, Shelly Mae and Stella Lou. They have stuffed animals, key chains, artwork etc. Then, popcorn buckets, buzz light year, mickeys suitcase, more. Buy it and wear it around your neck like a status symbol.Speaking of popcorn, how about a savory soy sauce and butter, or tomato n herb, or shrimp flavored?  Yep.Learn some key Japanese phrases, line types of food and don‚Äôt plan on the Disney staff all speaking a great deal of English. Invest in 100 words and you will do fine. Come in, you‚Äôre going all the way to Japan!"
616,3,18-Jun,Sweden,"A lot of people, nice castle","It was big and so mutch people. Long time to order some food.  But it was nice. If you want to do some attraction its like 1-1,5  hours waiting time."
617,5,18-Jul,Japan,The happiest place on earth!,"Given that we only speak English, we thought that it‚Äôll be hard to navigate and even more, enjoy the ambience and experience.  That was not the case at all.  We have since visited Tokyo Disney 3 times since 2015 and are certain that it‚Äôll be a destination every time we visit Japan!  My daughters - 9 and 10 - love it a lot and so do me and my wife!Recommendations -‚Ä¢ map your day out - figure what rides you might want to do and head straight for the fast pass when you enter.Reminder:  you can only have one fast pass assigned at any given time - so be sure to look at the schedule before you check out a fast pass ticket (you might pull a pm ticket and won‚Äôt be able to get any other fast lapses during the am)‚Ä¢ budget for food and drinks.  Most of the restaurants are expensive...but the experience is worth it!‚Ä¢ Wear good shoes‚Ä¢ if you‚Äôre doing a full day, break away for lunch.  Use the Disney train to go to ikspiari mall and eat lunch there!  It‚Äôs cheaper and there are more food options.  ‚Ä¢ make sure you watch the night parade!  Usually around 730‚Ä¢ fireworks at 830!!"
618,5,18-May,United States,It's Disney in Japan!,"Tokyo Disneyland offers a classic, wonderful Disney experience in Tokyo.  The rides and general experience is very similar to the Disneyland in California and Magic Kingdom in Orlando, except all customer service and shows are in Japanese.  Original music is of course in English.  Most cast members speak a little English, so that helps, for those who do not speak Japanese.  Language was NOT an issue for English speakers.  The park was clean, beautiful and classic Disney.  It was a very special experience to go to Tokyo DIsneyland."
619,3,18-Jun,Australia,Too crowded to fully enjoy,"We went two days when crowds were at 50 and 25% capacity.  The park itself is wonderful with great rides, facilities and staff, however at 50% capacity every ride had a wait time of between 1 to 2 hours.  The Fastpass system is not as good as the US, we could only get 1 pass for a ride in 3 or 4 hours time, then wait another hour to get a second FP.  FP only available for some rides.  Single rider line only available at Splash Mountain.  Long queues for the womens toilets, to get a drink or buy food.  Not many characters throughout the park, however lots near the entrance through the day.  Many rides were different versions to the US.  Great park with lots of seating, shaded areas, fantastic parades, etc.  All shows and instructions are in Japanese."
620,4,18-Jun,Malaysia,"Friendly staff, fun park!",I went to Tokyo Disneyland with my 4 years old son while my husband and my the other two big kids enjoyed at Disneysea on the same day.  We enjoyed our one day bonding time there.  The staff are super friendly and polite.  We enjoyed the parade and performance.  Long queue for most of the ride but queue in good order.  The only regret is we have no chance to meet Mickey in Mickey house as the queue was too long.
621,5,18-Jun,Australia,10-Oct,"Disney always days things over the top and amazing and this is no difference. It was the 35th year anniversary celebrations so that was great, special parades and free fast passes. A must see for Tokyo."
622,5,18-Jun,Indonesia,Fun!,I mean what could go wrong with disney? Disneyland!! I love it but there‚Äôs one thing .. it‚Äôs very crowded!!! üòÇ or we can say that it‚Äôs too crowded 
623,4,17-Jul,India,Another Feather in Tokyo's Cap,"Already overwhelmed by the warmth and courtesy of the locals, Tokyo Disneyland added more fun to our experience. Though language is a bit of an issue here, but they surely make extra effort to help you. Very sensitive to families and small children."
624,5,18-Jun,Australia,Such a fabulous day!,Have been to Disney in LA and Florida and loved the Tokyo one just as much. We went on a day that didn‚Äôt seem to be as busy as usual and the longest we waited was 40 minutes for a ride. We got three fast passes which helped a lot and I would recommend this if you are going. The staff were friendly and helpful and I thought the food prices were very reasonable. 
625,4,18-May,United States,NOT anything like Disneyland or Disney World,I was disappointed at Tokyo Disneyland. It's not as developed or as interesting as Disneyland or Walt Disney World. I enjoyed hearing It's a Small World and Zip A Dee Doo Dah in Japanese though.
626,3,18-Jun,United Arab Emirates,Too Crowded,"One experience we could have save ourselves during our Japan stay. Too crowded, space mountain closed, fast passes were already gone when we arrived at 9:30am and avg waiting time at the key rides exceeded 2 hrs. Not worth it. We should have better visited Fuji-Q highland park instead which has more exciting roller coasters and far less visitors.Learnings from the day:1) Be early:We visited Disneyland with our three children 7, 11 and 14 years. While we went during the week and arrived at 9:30am the Fast passed were already gone. If you want a smooth experience be at the park at 8:00am sharp, head directly to the key attractions and collect your Fast Passes there at the vending machines. Fast passes are free and only valid and available for individual rides so plan your visit and key attractions you want to see in advance.2) Great for younger kids. Take teenagers to Fuji-Q Highland unless they are into Disney:I had been to EuroDisney a number of times in the past. The last time 10 years ago. While Disneyland Tokyo is comparable in size and rides my kids (11 and 14) prefer more faster rollercoasters. As space mountain was closed for maintenance Big Thunder Mountain did not really excite them and the waiting time for splash mountain was in excess of 2 hours.The Haunted House was not scary as well. So most rides were great for my 7 year old while my teenagers were bored. 3) Popcorn:Popcorn seems to be a highlight in the park. Watch out though. While there are many popcorn stations, each one sells a different flavor. The flavors and location of the stations are indicated on the map. Check the flavor before queuing for 15 minutes to get a bag of popcorn that is not the right flavor.Overall the park is very clean, staff are the most friendliest staff in the world and it can be a  great day out with if planned right and you are ok with crowds. At around 2:00pm it was hardly possible to even walk on the Main Street. So we decided to leave."
627,5,18-Apr,United States,A Classic,"We loved walking around the park, enjoying the outside entertainment as much as the rides Our favorite is Pirates of the Caribbean.  There is a projection light event in World Bazaar at night.  We can't miss the characters they are everywhere.  "
628,5,18-Jun,Philippines,Truly Dream Come True!,Our first Disney! and we fell in love definitely a must visit especially if you have a child or a child at heart. One day is not enough to stroll around!
629,5,18-Apr,United States,Fun across the planet!,So you are a foreigner in Japan and you want to have some fun! Of course hit all the sites you can that are native. But...don‚Äôt forget about Tokyo Disneyland!!! It is similar to the original in design and has its own flavor around the park while feeling like the same place you have known as a kid! Tons of rides and experience to be had. A great one full day of fun to be had by all!
630,3,18-Apr,United States,Disneyland is Disneyland,"Even in Japanese, the experience is familiar.  Having grown up in Southern California and old enough to remember opening day in 1957, this is an easy comparison.  So many of the favorites - Jungle Cruise, Bear Country Jamboree (hysterical in Japanese), Tiki Room (ditto), teacups.  The electric light parade was especially well done, but the long lines and attempt to get a time stamp resulted in getting a reservation for 12 hours later  - sorry, not really helpful.  Otherwise, it was a fun, typical visit."
631,5,18-Jun,United States,Full day of Disney fun and food,"Buy your ticket before arriving to avoid standing in line at the ticket window. The staff is very polite even during the bag search at the entrance. Get your Fast Passes at the popular rides first thing. The Honey Bear attraction seemed to be popular with the younger kids. Space Mountain wasn't in operation. There is the upbeat Disney music near the Main Street entrance and we even watched a small group of Disney performers in futuristic space costumes doing a singing and beatbox performance in the middle of the day. The shaved ice flavors seemed to vary according to where you are in the park. The matcha shaved ice was in Adventureland and it was a wonderful and refreshing snack to have during the hot day. It came with a dollop of sweet adzuki and an alien mochi dumpling on top. I had to ask an employee where the matcha flavor shaved ice was offered. The park does have other flavors of shaved ice like orange at other locations. Ask an employee because they have a map of where these can be found. The queues are long, but the system is very efficient. Star Tours was my favorite even if it was all in Japanese. Try to ride it more than once to see the different videos. There are employees helping senior citizens with canes and wheelchair guests enter and exit Star Tours through a different door. One female employee who helped the handicapped guests at Star Tours on June 8, Sato san, even took the time to speak to me (in Japanese) about my taking refuge under the tree to escape the heat while I ate my pizza. It's the small things that make Tokyo Disneyland special. I would suggest eating lunch an hour before or an hour after the major noon lunch crowd. It was difficult to get a table to sit down at during the peak lunch rush so people were eating outside and sitting on low walls or even sitting on the ground. In Tokyo Disneyland, people stood in line patiently, employees took pride in their jobs, and it was the most orderly crowd I have seen at an amusement park. It was fairly easy to get to on the subway. Like other Disneyland parks, the experience is fun for people of all ages. Remember to wear a hat and stay hydrated if it is a hot day because the queues can be very long and the sun can be harsh."
632,5,18-Jun,Singapore,Disneyland Tokyo - probably the best Disneyland in the world,"A disclaimer first. I purchased a ""Enjoy Lots of Attractions"" Vacation Package. That gave me a few advantages like a number of Fast Pass ""A"" tickets (which I could use for all rides which allowed Fast Passes) and ""D"" tickets (which I could use for all Fast Pass rides except Nemo and Toy Story). I could use these Fast Passes at anytime. All this allowed me to cut down on the queuing time which made it a much more pleasant experience (the queues were incredible). The time savings alone really paid for itself. The ticket also allowed me to visit and go back and forth Disneyland and DisneySea - which allowed for maximum flexibility which I needed because of young kids in tow. But there are other reasons why I think this is probably the best Disneyland (and I mean, both Disneyland and DisneySea Tokyo) in the world.1. The Japanese Way of Doing things - polite, efficient, organised and clean. The toilets are incredibly clean even with the international crowds, and they generally don't smell. I am not sure how they manage to do that. And when it comes to watching the day and night parades, the first few rows of people viewing the parade will need to sit down so that the people standing behind willhave a relatively unobstructed view of the parade. 2. The Attention to Detail. When you walk through the park, try to take the time to look for the small details which have been built into the design. Photos, footprints, little knick-knacks placed here and there, and even the dry-wit in the posters and chalkboards. Take a look at some of the photos.3. The Snacks and Drinks - the soft serve ice-cream (albeit a tad sweet compared to the usual Japanese soft serve ice-cream) and the different flavours of popcorn, the range of drinks available ranging from bubble tea (the tapioca mango drink at Squeezers), hot/iced chocolate to the ubiquitous oolong tea. 4. The kawaii-factor. If you need to find an excuse to wear that cute Disney ears, hat, matching t-shirts or whatever, then you will feel right at place in the park because a number of people were wearing them. It was also fortuitous that the park was celebrating the Tanabata Festival. Anyway, that meant that some Japanese visitors (adults and kids alike) to the park wore light and colourful kimonos called yukatas. Very kawaii. There are some negatives though.  1. The Crowds. I visited the park on a Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, and with the exception of a rainy day, the other days were crowded. This obviously meant that the queues were very very long (which is why the Fast Passes came in handy). I cannot imagine the crowds on a weekend.  2. Language. The shows are largely performed using the Japanese language. So unless you understand Japanese, the shows are largely for visual effects. It also makes it a wee bit difficult trying to communicate. Use your translation apps or convince a friend who speaks Japanese to come along with you.But all in all, the positives largely outweighed the negatives, and my kids loved it."
633,5,18-Jun,Canada,Disney Magic and Japanese efficiency,"Tokyo Disneyland was similar to other Disney properties but smaller in size. Although most of the shows were in Japanese were a little English thrown in, we enjoyed them all. The park was very clean and the staff helpful.We used a crowd predictor and were there with very light crowds. We used FastPasses and were pleased that the lines weren't too long for the other attractions. We were there for 12 hours and saw everything we wanted to see in the first 5 hours and so repeated our favorites and saw other things until the fireworks.I had a great time there and would highly recommend it for anyone in the area."
634,4,18-Feb,Malaysia,Fun,Get there early to beat the crowds and don't forget to get your fast pass.The rides are fun but unfortunately all shows are all in Japanese.
635,4,18-Jun,N/A,What a crowd!,"We went to Tokyo Disneyland for a one day trip in June, on a Sunday noon. We expect to see a lot of crowd but we did not expect to see so much!Traveling there is easy: Take the train to Maihama train station and just follow the path (or the crowd) to the Disneyland entrance. After a swift security bag check and entry payment, you can spend the rest of the entire day and night enjoying the theme parks. Well, you'll spend more time queuing for the rides, but I guess we expected that. Typical queue time for rides is around 130min, except for the ones which are not so interesting. Overall, it's been good fun. But for impatient guys like me, looking at the queues is already mood-dampening enough."
636,5,18-May,Australia,Tokyo Disneyland is the Best IMO,"The magic of Disney, brought to you by the polite and respectful Japanese.The park is super clean.  Staff are incredibly helpful and polite.Every visit to Japan, includes a day a Tokyo Disneyland."
637,5,17-Nov,United Kingdom,Brilliant day out,Just as amazing as DisneySea! We loved both parks but did note that whilst we were at Disneyland a couple of the biggest rides were closed for refurbishments. We did go outside of peak season though and we understand maintenance is essential so weren‚Äôt that bothered. We had a great day and would highly recommend it!Maybe take some snacks with you though as the food is expensive! 
638,5,18-Jun,Philippines,When in Japan,Must see place! Although June is not the best time to go there due to the rainy season and we ended up with a very cold gloomy day but that didn‚Äôt stop us from enjoying Disneyland! We all enjoyed it especially my baby despite the cold weather. Good thing it was just cloudy and windy! Best to go there in july and august during summer and preferably on a weekday since there will be a lot of people during the weekends with their family! Getting a fast pace ticket would also help u when there‚Äôs a long line so u can go in ahead :)
639,5,17-Oct,Singapore,Tourists Should Visit. Very Enjoyable Experience.,"Review by DrSim001 (Dr. H.C.M. Sim). Tourists Should Visit. Very Enjoyable Experience. I like most Disney around the world. The Only problem with this Disney is that most of the communication is in Japanese. However, the Japanese are very polite and gracious people and this makes the experience wonderful. Stay for the fireworks in the evening. Go early in the morning. Bring your own water and a light jacket for light rain. Expensive but almost everything of quality is expensive in Tokyo. Regards DrSim001 (Dr H.C.M. Sim)"
640,4,18-May,United Kingdom,For the kids!,"Definitely one for the kids, so many Disney characters dotted around always happy to take pictures! If you‚Äôre there by yourself and say ‚Äòsolo rider‚Äô to the staff you might get fast-tracked through the mammoth queues! ;)"
641,5,18-Jan,Malaysia,Tokyo Disneyland during Winter,"A lot of things to do in Tokyo Disneyland. Even thought my family had the express pass, we still had to queue. So plan your time well. Best to identify the activities you want to do and plan your time accordingly. We were there during winter. It was cold despite the sun being out. The night was freezing with strong winds. Wear comfortable clothes but make sure you keep warm."
642,4,18-Jun,Australia,A great day out at Tokyo Disney,After28 years I have returned to Tokyo DisneyA great day outYes it's crowdedYes it's long waiting for the ridesIt's a choice
643,2,18-May,United Kingdom,Terrible in Comparison to DisneySea,"You can definitely see that the high ticket price goes into how well decorated the park is. There is a lot of style over substance here. I wouldn't bother unless you have little kids. Go to DisneySea instead.The only ""thrilling"" ride is probably Splash Mountain. The rest of them are designed for VERY small children. I mean, like under 10. Space Mountain was okay, but ultimately just another children's ride. I was getting excited with all the signs telling me it was fast paced and thrilling, even designing escape routes for people who chicken out... but it was an overall meh.This theme park has the castle, but DisneySea is miles better. I had never been to a Disney park before, but I can now confirm that they are grossly overhyped. If you have small children, it will certainly bring them lots of entertainment. For me, it was a dud.Also to note: Very difficult to find vegetarian/vegan food here. Only 2 places offer a vegetarian OPTION and one of them is in the most expensive restaurants. Very sad to see a huge company like this not cater to everyone.Tip: The fast passes are free. You get one every two hours. Go to the ride you want to go on the most as soon as you get there, and you will get given the next available fast pass time. I went for Tower of Terror (DisneySea) at 10am and our fast pass was not until 5pm."
644,4,18-Jun,Singapore,Crowded but fun,"Was raining pretty heavy and had to buy raincoats. Despite the rain the park was very crowded. Thanks to fast pass still managed to play big thunder mountain but splash mountain queue was 120mins and space mountain was closed. Had lunch at hungry bear curry which was good but had to queue to get in, in the rain. Overall still good fun. "
645,5,18-Jun,Singapore,Utterly fantastic,"I had extensively planned our trip (there were so many super detailed blog reviews by Disney fanatics and family bloggers) and the effort did not come to waste!We planned to go on an off-peak day (29000 folks expected on 12 Jun vs 50000 the day before), and although we couldn‚Äôt plan the weather, God was merciful and the forecasted thunderstorm did not materialise. We managed to go on 14 rides/shows, watched 3 parades plus the fireworks show, and left an hour before closing. A magical day in so many ways for my kids and I. Just make sure your party enjoys Disney (my hubby really did not enjoy himself one bit - party pooper). "
646,5,18-Jun,N/A,Crowded during Rainy weekday,"Went on a weekday, and it was raining the whole day. But it didn't dampen our mood, wearing rain coat and keep playing. Park was big compared to DisneySea. Made sure to made full use of the Fast Pass. Had a great wet day in Disneyland."
647,4,18-May,United Kingdom,"Fun theme park, can become crowded","We had a fun time here, service was great, make sure you try the snacks too - all delicious!At the weekend (including Friday) queues can get uncomfortably long, so try and visit mid-week if possible and make use of FastPass."
648,4,18-Jun,Australia,Good Day Out,Was great day outPlenty of people but everyone so happyLong lines into attractions with 1hr waits may be wise to get a fast track passFood everywhere with plenty of choicesEasy to get to from Tokyo by trainOverall a good day out
649,5,18-May,N/A,Golden Week Well Spent,My family spent Japan‚Äôs Golden Week at Tokyo Disney Resort. It was also the 5th birthday of my nephew. The park was full of visitors all excited the grand parade in the afternoon. It was my second Disney resort visit but I was still taken by surprise how Tokyo Disney Resort awakens the inner child in me!
650,4,18-Jun,Australia,Popular fun family day out,Jump in fast for express ride tickets because they are all gone by mid late mornings. Big queue for most popular rides. Single riders are the fastest if they are available for the ride. So much quicker üôÇ
651,4,18-May,Philippines,Too crowded,"Went in around 3pm and the park was really crowded. This is my 2nd Disneyland and Hongkong was my first. My son was surprised with the crowd coz he already visited Hongkong as well as Shanghai. You will see lots of students in their uniform walking around the park. Amidst all the crowd, Disneyland still makes you smile and be a kid once in awhile. The best part is to stay until closing hours with fewer lines and more opportunity to ride everything. Too bad fireworks were cancelled due to windy weather. "
652,5,18-Feb,Indonesia,1st family visit to Japan,"I went to Disneyland Tokyo with my family. The weather is cold and freezing, but we enjoyed a lot. My children have so much fund exploring Disneyland. Maybe one day we go there again."
653,5,18-Apr,Ireland,Great day for adults ,"My husband turned 36 whilst we were in Tokyo, neither of us had ever been to a Disneyland, he didn‚Äôt even know there was one there. We took the bus out from Shinjuku station took about 45 minutes. We bought our tickets there. There were no ques. We spent the whole day there. Wear comfy clothes!!! The most we waited for a ride was 30 minutes and with a fast pass ten minutes. We have been told since compared to other Disney‚Äôs lands this is amazing. The whole park is spotless and all the staff wonderful. The popcorn is soo good. The parade is worth waiting around for, get a good viewing point. We got the train back. "
654,5,18-Jun,Vietnam,Wonderful experience ,"It was an amazing experience ! Despite the hospitality , we were astonished with the architecture and decorations around the area . It was like a dream come true."
655,5,18-May,Australia,My favourite,"My favourite! I have been to multiple Disney resorts around the world and the Tokyo resort is a cut above the rest! I've been here multiple times and the must-do's are investigating and trying all the many popcorn flavours, checking out the incredible merch and souvenirs section (think beautiful biscuit tins, perfect for gifts), and having lunch at the Queen of Hearts banquet hall. Make sure to check early if there is a lottery for any shows the day that you visit! "
656,5,17-Dec,Indonesia,FUNNNNNNN,Last time we were here in 2009. Loved it everytime we come back. Brings back tons of memories.Thanks for all the great service Disney@
657,4,18-Apr,Australia,Disney magic with Japanese efficiency,"This is the third Disneyland I have been to, and it still did not disappoint.  Try all the different flavours of popcorn.  It is big enough that there is always something to do, but not so big that you feel you are missing out if you are only there for a day.  Has all the Disney staple rides, plus a few unique ones.  Shows were fun and entertaining, and of course all the cast members are the picture of politeness and efficiency that you would expect from Japan.  My mum lost her camera on a ride and a fantastically helpful cast member found it for her, delivered it back to her, and then gave her a hug when she was crying over having lost it."
658,4,18-Apr,Singapore,Enchanting experience,"I‚Äôm writing as a parent who bought a 2.5 yr kid to disneyland Tokyo for the first time. The castle is really pretty, much prettier than hk‚Äôs. My impression of the best rides is monster inc for the fun element, space mountain (as single rider option for parents while my son sleeps). Space mountain has  fabulous view of the various cartoon characters along the ride and although some of the signature rides for kids are closed during that period (Pooh‚Äôs hunny hunt and it‚Äôs a small world), we still think it‚Äôs quite worth while to visit. The queen of hearts banquet hall is a sight to behold! And the legendary various popcorn flavors with the quite expensive containers are sought after. I particularly like the Cinderella carriage but got Mickey Mouse for my son. If anyone is considering going, pls check their official website for any closure of rides, opening hours and also find out options like single rider, fast passes to help you reduce some waiting time there."
659,5,18-Jun,Philippines,You can never go wrong to visit,"As per my title, you can never go wrong visiting Tokyo Disneyland. We enjoyed our time there and the only issue we have are the queue to the famous rides even on weekdays."
660,3,18-Jun,United Kingdom,Not the Best Disney but visit it anyway,"We had visited, Eurodisney, California, Florida and Hong Kong before coming to Tokyo, with the basis of our experience I have to say the Tokyo Disneyland is not the best of the parks we have visited.The main issue is I have to say the crowds, we went on a Tuesday during school time, where according to the local info it would be circa 50% capacity, it was however absolutely packed, I dread to think what it would have been on a peak day.The other downside is the fast pass system is fully embraced here and it is quite normal for fast passes to be fully issued before lunchtime for some rides (kind of defeats the object in our view)On the plus side the staff are very friendly and their are a couple of unique rides, catering is a little unique as well with some interesting choicesWe enjoyed the visit and certainly one to tick off the bucket list"
661,1,18-Apr,Singapore,GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT ,"It was so crowded with waiting time exceeding 100 mins at least to 200 mins. The Fastpass is totally useless. We went to the Fastpass machine at 1400hrs n was given the time for the next ride at 1900 hrs n can't go for other Fastpass rides until the previous Fastpass have expired . Really ridiculous, waste of money n time. In the end we just walked around n managed to take 2 unpopular rides based on queuing for the whole day spent. No More Disneyland for us. Felt cheated. Too many people n it's up to you either queue or nothing. Same situation in Shanghai too. TOTALLY DISAPPOINTING."
662,4,18-Jun,United Kingdom,Fantastic light show,"Visited Disneyland Tokyo as part of a 3-week trip to Japan. Even with it being a weekday it was extremely busy with 2+ hour queues for most attractions, which wasn‚Äôt helped by fast passes being unavailable to buy. Nevertheless, still had a great day, with big thunder mountain being a clear favourite. To top it off, the light show at 7:30pm was well worth staying for, brilliant seeing all the characters come by in a parade. Like another reviewer said, fantastic day but once in a lifetime thing. Maybe try Disney sea if back in Japan. "
663,5,17-Oct,Australia,The happiest place on Earth.,"If you are planning to go to Japan without visiting Disneyland... think again! It is a MUST DO. I have done the Disney in LA and now the one in Japan and I loved both. This one is much smaller but don't forget there's Disney sea next door! The rides are super cool, and they have skip the line tickets that don't cost a cent!"
664,3,18-May,Indonesia,Once in a lifetime,"This is our 2nd Disneyland (1st at Disneyland Hong Kong), we get a 2 days pass, with the second day in Disneysea. We can say for sure that 35th Years Disneyland Tokyo really show it's age, the attractions and the shows are old, and I think they do it on purpose since Disneysea (next door) is really new and fun. For the first timer as us, it really a once in a lifetime moment. The parade is beautiful, the show randomly pop up here and there (which a bit annoying since we actually want to see but somehow when we found it, it's at the end of the show). On the other hand, souvenirs are actually cheaper than at Universal Studio. We manage to buy a Disneyland Tokyo Banana, some clothes and hats. We even take a special food package with a beautiful 35th Disneyland anniversary bag."
665,3,18-Jun,Indonesia,Small and crowded,After being promised by my late grandma to be taken here 30yrs ago finally had a chance to visit it. The map had changed a bit from the old map and certain rides were not there anymore. Even the space mountain was  under renovation. Almost every ride had a long line. U better plan carefully to utilize your fastpass. 
666,5,18-May,Australia,Happy 15 with a toddler - perfect day,"Our expectations of what we could achieve with a toddler (2.5 year old) were pretty low and I think that's a great way to approach the day. Our goal was to ride the Winnie the Pooh Honey Hunt ride and the Monsters Inc ride without too much of a wait time, then make it back to the hotel for a nap before going back. We stayed at the Disney Ambassador hotel in order to get the Happy 15 (this is a free pass if you stay at certain luxury type resorts where you get access to the Park 15 - 30 minutes earlier than general public). This meant that we had a wait time of barely 5 minutes to get on the Honey Hunt ride (I don't think the ride actually opened until the general park opening but you can line up during the Happy 15). Once that was done we lined up for Monsters inc for around 15 minutes, so by 9am we had achieved the day's goal and everything else was a bonus! Just one thing that should be completely obvious but might not be: all of the characters on all of the rides speak in Japanese and sing Japanese versions of songs (like the Tigger song which seemed familiar but not quite the same melody/cadence as the English version)... but they still have recognisable character voices, most of the storylines you don't really need to understand what is going on or enjoy the ride, and I'm pretty sure your toddler won't even notice. We explained how clever the characters were that they could speak Japanese as well as English because we were encouraging our toddler to say 'thank you' etc in Japanese while we were there.We went before opening on Thursday in late May on an overcast (but not cold or rainy) day, which was perfect. The crowds were relatively low. We saw the crowds swell on the Friday/Saturday and afternoons and wait times got really long. I feel that you're better off going back to your hotel after the late morning parade to catch a nap and then heading back again after they wake up, early evening, if your toddler can make it to 8pm - 9pm the crowds thin out and the wait times go back to 5 - 20 minutes per ride."
667,5,18-May,Singapore,Worth It!,"Disneyland was amazing! It was crowded, as expected, but the fun of this place made it all worth it! Lines dissipate pretty quickly, and there are Fastpasses available every hour for those who‚Äôd like to skip the lines. Even the rains failed to dampen spirits. "
668,4,18-Apr,N/A,Very crowded,Many spot to take photo and many games in there. Very crowded at weekend so better go at the weekday.
669,5,18-Jun,N/A,Awesome,"It was a very enjoyable trip this time around. The lines were ok and we were able to go on all of the attractions we wanted, even without using too many fast passed. Food surprisingly has reasonable prices too "
670,5,18-May,Australia,Visit with toddlers,"Disneyland is fantastic I was there with two kids (4 & 1). They had a ball. Little kids can‚Äôt go on most of the rides but there is still plenty for them to do. My only suggestion go on a Monday-Thursday as Friday, Saturday and Sunday are incredibly busy."
671,4,18-May,United Kingdom,Madly Busy Even in The Week,"You gotta love Disney it has a captive audience. However, I have never been to one that is so busy even in the week. This means massive long waiting times and sitting down for an hour before a parade to ensure you get a good view! That said at least as you sit down for the parade there is no pushing or shoving from people behind.There is a severe lack of Disney princesses to have photos taken with as there is no princess pavilion.There are nice opportunities at the entrance for photos with other characters and the merchandise stores seem cheaper than Paris or Orlando. The food selection is typical of what you would expect at a Disney park!There is a nice area called toon town which young kids love. They can wonder in and out of the characters houses.In slightly windy weather they cancel the fireworks and if it‚Äôs slightly raining our night parade was cancelled too!Due to the business of the park you can‚Äôt do it all in a day!"
672,5,18-May,Japan,Magic!,"Like all Disney, incredible! Magic and special. Buy your ticket before and get your pass quickly, it's very useful."
673,4,18-Apr,N/A,:),"Anything Disney equates = happy :) Cheaper tickets, lesser crowds and shorter lines made it more enjoyable than the Disneyland at home here in California. Rides like Pirates, Big Thunder and Star Tours operate similarly to the SoCal ones. Space Mountain stuck out because instead of the Cali sensory overload with the music blasting in your ears, Tokyo Space was quiet with just the sound of the track, making it more eerie like. Pretty cool. If I'm not mistaken, there's no Matterhorn which kind of bummed me out since it's one of my favorites. My other favorite -Indiana Jones- is in Tokyo DisneySea, which I unfortunately didn't have time for. In retrospect, had I researched better and wouldn't have been crunched for time, I probably would have opted for DisneySea since it seems more unique. No regrets, just another excuse to try to go back! But definitely make time for both parks if time and money allow."
674,5,18-May,N/A,My visit to Disneyland Tokyo,Actually it was my dream come true .. from I was kid .. so it definitely will be a magical trip for me .. I wish that I will go into this again.. even if it's so crowded üòÇ and you should stand in very long queue every where to play or eat or even for buying a bottle of water .. but it's still the most happiest place I ever went for ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
675,3,18-May,United Kingdom,Good but needs to review its Fast Pass system,"Tokyo Disneyland was a pleasant experience considering this was my first ever visit to any Disneyland, although the rides are catered for the younger visitors but the atmosphere was great and thoroughly enjoyed it. The Japanese are all very accommodating and customer centric which made being there more enjoyable.As mentioned, a lot of the rides are tailored for younger children and being a young coupon of 27 and 28 years old we didn't go on all the rides. The ones we did go were enjoyable and nothing that will scare even the faintest heart visitor. The following are all highly recommended; Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blaster, Space Mountain and Thunder Mountain.However my biggest complaint is that their Fast Pass system seems flawed due to it being offered for free and the passes being limited to time slots across the day, plus you have to wait a certain amount of time before you can obtain another Fast Pass for another attraction. As we visited during Golden Week, the park was heaving and a lot of the Fast Passes were already all allocated, plus the queue times were at about 1 hour 30 minutes long. So if you think you can pay a little more to ensure you've tried all the rides, this isn't possible because they don't offer such system. If you don't manage to get any Fast Passes then waiting times can be quite long.If you plan to visit and want to maximise time then try to get as many Fast Passes... you may spend a lot of time wandering but it will be worth it. Take note of the cool down time between collecting the passes because you won‚Äôt be able to collect it all at once. This should definitely be looked at by management.Aside from this issue, the park itself is worth a visit!"
676,5,18-May,Taiwan,Shorter lines than I remember ,"I remember Disneyland Tokyo having the absolute worst lines. Not this time. I don't know if I never came on a good time/day before, or if it's because Shanghai's newly opened Disneyland is taking away a portion of the crowd, this time my experience was very different. We got to the park at 8:15 am on a Thursday in May. Throughout the day, there were only 2 rides that had 1-hour waits. Everything else was about 30 minutes maximum. Even when they tell you it's 30 minutes, it's more like 15 minutes. As a result, we had a really amazing time at the park and actually had so much time that we were able to do some rides twice. "
677,3,18-May,United Kingdom,No night entertainment,"So we had a perfect day got on alot of rides and shopping was great we brought lots.Waiting for the electrical parade for half hour with no announcement in English we had no idea due to a light spit of raining the electrical parade had become 3 floats of Mickey and friends in rain gear.Ok i thought electricals in rain fair enough we can look forward to the illuminations sat waiting and just 15 minutes before theres an english announcement saying we regret to announce the illuminations are cancelled.Now this really annoyed me, barely any notice and there had been no rain for a while at this point and barely any wind yet at other Disney parks they still perform illuminations even in the rain.This sadly left us wanting more and dissapointed we had travelled all the way from the UK and could only set aside one day for Disney and for no night entertainment without just cause we feel all the excitement just gone immedeatly which is a shame."
678,2,18-May,Australia,Too crowded ,"This place is so crowded, I think there should be a limit on ppl then would be more enjoyable. Didnt stay long as line up for food was long and so was the rides."
679,5,18-May,United Kingdom,Disney... Always amazing,The disney in tokyo is not as big compared to others I have been to but it still has lots to do.Got there 9in the afternoon and my daughter had a great day. Went on 'it's a small world and the haunted house rides.The parade was great and they did fireworks before closing.It was their 35 year anniversary and there were many extra fun things to do.We all enjoyed it very much.
680,5,18-May,Australia,Always awe inspiring,"Disney is a wonderful place to visit, people are always friendly and happy.  Staff are helpful and have wonderful smiles on their faces, lots of rides and exhibitions to visits and don't forget the shopping."
681,5,18-May,Japan,It was absolutely fantastic!!!!,"We went on a Sunday, the amount of people in the property was just mind blowing.  That being said, if you have a bit of planning and understand the system, you can have a great time.We arrived about 7:30 AM and waited to get in.  I rushed to get our fast pass for Hunny Hunt while my wife ran to get into the lineup for Space Mountain.  It took a hour to get the fast pass and join my wife.  We waited in line for about a hour for the newly renovated  ""Small World"".Star Tours, Monsters, Big Thunder - all what fun.  Makes you remember your childhood.By the end of the day, we had gone to 7 rides, 2 parades and a firework shop despite overwhelming crowds.  Food is very expensive and not that great but what can you do? They had great crowd management, cleanest place and it was a great time.  You need to do some planning and time management and you can have a wonderful time despite huge crowds."
682,5,18-Apr,New Zealand,Absolutely amazing,"I absolutely fell in love with Tokyo Disneyland. I found it much bigger than the one on Hong Kong and LA. It's very clean and easy to get around. There are many staff around to assist. Even though this is something small but I absolutely love the popcorn stands. You can buy a themed popcorn box and go to other stands to refill for 500yen. There are so many different flavours too. From garlic prawn, to black pepper to blueberry etc etc. The map also marks where the popcorn stands are and what flavour they are. I think you need 2 days to finish the park if you don't want to rush and see everything. There are many shows around for kids too. I went there during their Easter/ 35year celebration, so they had afternoon parade and also the night light parade. Get a good seat early. Maybe an hour before the show you should secure a good seating. Love the shops in Disneyland though they are pricey. To me there wasn't much food options are also pricey. You can borrow a pushchair or wheelchair at Disneyland. The map give you a lot of detail, where shops are, attractions, photo ops of the characters. Alice in Wonderland caf√© had specialty cakes during their 35year year celebration, which was great as we celebrated my godson's 5th birthday with a cake there. The staff are very friendly, they all said happy birthday to my godson as he was wearing a birthday badge that I had brought. They gave out stickers for first visits, birthdays etc. Where as LA gave you an actual badge. The tickets to Disneyland/ Disney sea were cute. You have to keep a hold of it if you buy consecutive day passes. I purchased a 4 day pass and the first 2 days you have to go to the park you chose and the 3rd and 4th day you can go either park. Unfortunately you have to use it consecutively, you can't have a break in the middle and continue. That's when it gets tiring. There are some things for the little kids but more for big kids- or depending if you're little kids get scared easily or not.  But my god son love the toy story attraction in Disney sea, the monster inc attraction in Disneyland, Small world attraction and he love the parades with all the characters. He got scared in the Nemo attraction and the submarine attraction in Disney sea ( which is has aliens under water)Note:* NEVER go on a weekend as the locals go there too so it's VERY crowded. there's no point lining up as its like 2-3hours per ride waiting time and also fast track lines are very long too. *I think 3 days is enough for both parks you can go to Disneyland first day then Disney sea second day and go to which ever you like the best on the third day."
683,5,17-Sep,Australia,The happiest place in the world,"Took the whole family to Disneyland.    Unfortunately it was raining but this did not damper our spirits!!! Rode most of the rides and must say, the transformers was the best. We stayed for well over 3hrs.Dreams do really come true!!!"
684,2,18-May,Australia,seriously overcrowded,"Being my first ever visit to a Disneyland I was so excited, only to be left soo very disappointed. In their defence they did try to warn me, at the gate when buying a ticket they hand you an English card explaining that it was a busy day, and that the popular rides would be a 3 hour wait. They weren‚Äôt exaggerating. If you do decide to go, get there early and run around the main rides setting up your fast pass. You can scan your ticket at fast pass stations, which will then give you a set time to come back to the ride and skip the main queue. We worked this out too late to help us."
685,4,18-May,Singapore,Fun but long queues,"There is a whole host of rides available in the park and they are best known for the three Mountains - Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, and Big Thunder Mountain. The queues, however, get insanely long. It may be a good idea to bring extra money to buy fast passes to join a much, much shorter queue."
686,5,18-May,Denmark,A beautiful Disneypark,Disneyland is always worth a visit and this one didn't dissapoint. The service level is way above Walt Disney World and Disneyland in both California and Paris. The park is clean and beautiful. We went on a quiet day and didn't wait in line for long. 
687,5,17-Sep,Philippines,Amazing Trip,"I have described Tokyo Disneyland as magical land, my daughter and I really enjoy the whole day tour. I feel young, LOLS. Hehehe. This is my 2nd time been to Disneyland, my first visit Disney was in Hong Kong, I feel the same way like a child, specially with my daughter. She taught all Disney Princess is real, we went to Cinderella Castle. We enjoy all the rides, the Parade and Fireworks display. I promise to her that we will visit Tokyo Disneyland Again soon.... Astig"
688,5,17-Oct,Australia,Amazing park and staff,We visited both Disneyland and DisneySea and enjoyed both. Easy to use the fast pass system. Get there early to avoid long waits for rides. Lots of delicious treats to try. Staff were friendly and helpful. Close to JR station.
689,4,18-May,Australia,"Clean, large but everything is in Japanese ","If you can get past the fact that Star Wars‚Äôs C3PO is speaking in Japanese instead of posh British English you will love this park. It is very clean, and people are polite. There are also one or two rides that aren‚Äôt at the US parks. Not a lot of your typical American Disney park foods to eat either... and watch out when buying the popcorn as they are all flavoured and you might get Sot Sauce flavour like I did."
690,4,18-May,Indonesia,Crowded and long queque every where.,"We though, visiting on weekdays probably less crowded....and we were wrong...packed with students. Even photo with micky in main entrance, we were waiting for 50 minutes...we managed 1 fast pass ticket. But after 1pm, no more fast pass. Even for unfamous ride...at least 15 minutes waiting. No just the rides...even in food area...long queque.But we love the parades especially night parades with light.Staffs are two tumbs up, they can control and help the crowds so well. Some staff has limited english, they bring their english conversation booklet."
691,3,18-May,Canada,First Time at Tokyo Disneyland,"Our first visit to Tokyo Disneyland, which will complete our bucket list of visiting all six Disney parks around the world. It's very crowded, as the Japanese love this park (they come dressed with their ears!). The wait for many of the rides are long, as they don't have FastPass for Hauted Mansion, It's A Small World and Jungle Cruise. The wait times for Splash Mountain and Buzz Lightyear are crazy! However, unlike Shanghai Disneyland, people are relatively nice and wait their turn. However, just like Shanghai Disneyland, they charge for the FastPass which is just wrong in my opinion. The food here is odd, as the western food like the foot long hot is more Japanese flavour than western. The Japanese like the Chinese buy everything, but not t-shirts or pins to trade. Overall, the staff are well organized in moving people along."
692,5,17-Jun,Singapore,A Disney theme park wonderfully different from the rest,"After you experiencing Tokyo Disneyland, you might just say that this is the best Disney theme park. This is the only Disney theme park not owned by Disney and I guess that creates an indescribable spark and edge over the rest of Disney theme parks. Most of the rides are equal counterparts to their American versions but you'll immediately notice that the streets are wider, giving the theme park a bigger feel. You will also get to meet Disney characters seldom met elsewhere, like characters from Hunchback and Mermaid!The rides and attractions are simply fantastic and you have got to dedicate 2 days to truly experience all of them, parades, rides, shows, shops. Be sure to spot the roving comedic cleaner!"
693,3,18-Apr,Thailand,Good for Theme park lover,"We went there in the beginning of the golden week - forecast 36K visitors. It was very crowd and you need to plan for attraction, food and everything. Please buy ticket in advance and use Fast Pass for the popular attractions - Star Tour is good. Although it was very crowd, the Disney staff can well organize."
694,5,17-Dec,Philippines,Happiest Place on Earth!,"Every child dreams of going to one of Disney‚Äôs biggest theme park, and I had my dream come true! Get the 4 days ticket for Disneyland and DisneySea coz 1 day for each ain‚Äôt enough!"
695,3,18-May,Indonesia,Difficult to get Food,"The park was full of visitor during my visit on April. All food counter were full of people! Need to solve this problem since so there were so many kids. Need to have clear directions inside, for moslem its difficult to find praying room. Employee were helpful and i consider that the management has striving their best to maintain the standard of quality of the property."
696,4,18-May,United Arab Emirates,In a Raining day! ,"It‚Äôs my birthday month !so I decided to celebrate in Japan / Disney Tokyo and have some fun. Unfortunately, the rain killed most of the fun as the crowd and the umbrellas in the outside attractions was just annoying! Also the some of games were closed because of the heavy rain .. tried to stay couple of hours and left around 4 pm. "
697,5,18-May,N/A,Oh my gosh!!,That‚Äôs the highlight of our trip! We had loads of fun  and were just amazed on how gorgeous it was. I just hope we can get back again
698,4,18-May,United States,a great park for a day!,almost a carbon copy of Magic Kingdom in Orlando but much nicer to get around.  Smaller and less crowded (on the day we were there)
699,5,18-Feb,Philippines,FUN FILLED EXPERIENCE,"Even though we arrived at pass 12 if the afternoon, we still manage to experience lots of rides. All staffs are very accommodating, and easy to approach, sometimes they take initiative in extending help. I love the parade as always along with the fireworks."
700,5,17-Nov,N/A,Fun and Memorable,"I went on a weekday with local Japanese friends with their two children, it was LESS crowded than the weekends. They have a show called ""One Man's Dream"" and you definitely have to try it. I would like to visit again with "
701,2,18-May,United States,Too crowded to enjoy,"This park is very similar to the original park in CA. On top of that, the lines are crazy long. Fast passes run out early and even for food I had to wait an hour for a turkey leg. The Japanese people are polite lovely people and don‚Äôt mind waiting 2 or 3 hours for a ride. I ended up leaving early I got so burnt out on the whole thing. My advice is to focus on DisneySea and leave this one out altogether. Otherwise expect to do a lot of waiting on lines. And get there by 7 or 7:30 because it will already be packed. "
702,2,18-Apr,Australia,Terrible,Love Disneyland and this was my second Disneyland experience (first in USA). Extremely disappointed in the whole experience. They allowed too many people entry which resulted in excessively long lines in everything from food to parade viewing to rides. 2.5hr wait for rides seemed to be the standard and we only managed to go on 5 despite being there all day. Needless to say we saw very little else! Were pushed away by staff at parade because apparently three lines of audience exceeds their overcrowding rules but 2.5hr+ wait in overcrowded lines for rides doesn‚Äôt!! Oh they have express tickets to rides - yes - but we got the first one as soon as we got there (1hr after opening) and our express ride wasn‚Äôt until 8pm!!! How ridiculous. It‚Äôs a shame that my kids first Disneyland experience was so disappointing and they are unwilling to go again.
703,5,18-Apr,Australia,Disneyland,Love Disneyland Tokyo there attention to detail is amazing . Be sure to do the night light parade it‚Äôs a must . And research there exclusive rides to Tokyo Disney
704,3,18-Apr,Australia,Worth a vist but the wait for the rides are way too long,"Tokyo Disneyland is worth a visit just to tick it off the list. Its similar to other big theme parks in that there's people everywhere, overpriced food and huge lines waiting for the rides. If you don't mind spending 100 - 120 minutes of your life waiting for a 5 min ride then this place is for you. Overall its ok experience and worthwhile to see the once. Doubt I would return any time soon though."
705,5,18-Apr,New Zealand,OMG Amazing,The shops were fantastic way better than LA Disneyland.  GO EARLY!  You must be there when it opens as it simply gets to busy from 11am to do any major rides.  Staff wonderful and helpful.  A must see.
706,3,18-May,N/A,Best to get there at opening time and use fast pass as much as possible,Ride lines were 15-20 minutes in the morning but after about 11am went to 100+ minutes.Best to arrive at opening time and plan your day first. Use fast pass to get tickets for as many popular attractions as possible in the morning and go on less popular rides while you're waiting for your allocated fast pass time and inbetween being able to get your next fast pass.If you plan to stay a whole day you'll thank youself in the afternoon once you're over lining up. 
707,5,18-May,N/A,Worth every ¬•,"Happiest place on Earth didn‚Äôt disappoint. Average waiting time for popular rides such as Space Mountain The Big Thunder Mountain are an average of 100mins. Do go for the fast pass if possible.Please note that the park is cater for locals. Hence, their interactive attractions are mostly in Japanese. Disney waffle was a long wait, a little pricey and taste mediocre. If you‚Äôre not planning to take a photo of the waffle, just skip it. "
708,5,18-May,Australia,Half a day of fun!,"We went in the middle of Golden Week on the one non-holiday day knowing it was a risk with the crowds; luckily it was a manageable crowd. Knowing this we were there just after it opened and walked straight in. The rides were great fun and being my first Disney experience, I was very impressed. Pirates of the Caribbean was my favourite for the day, I had high blood pressure so the most thrilling attraction I did was Star Tours. Our longest wait was about 40-50 minutes for the Haunted Mansion and this was at peak time. The waiting goes quick with the distraction of your surroundings and if you have company. The staff knew little English in my experience and spoke Japanese on all rides unless there was an animatronic, not a complaint at all considering this is Japan, but something to point out for any foreigners wondering. We finished up at 2 after feeling exhausted from standing and walking + it was a hot day which we were ill prepared for, but my memories will remember how much fun I had as long as you prepare to be patient!"
709,5,18-Apr,Lebanon,It's the most wonderful place...,"I've been to all Disneyland parks and by far my experience at Tokyo Disneyland was the best of all.  Okay, granted that some of the rides might be a bit ""tame"" but still, a lot of fun was had by all who joined.  Everyone was smiling and happy to be there.  Stayed until the late evening and watched the electric parade; well worth it.  Be prepared, as with most Disneyland parks, to wait in line for some time. Enjoy..."
710,3,18-Apr,Singapore,Average day at disneyland ,"Rides were very fun and memorable:) However, the crowd was quite insane on a weekday and everything including the shows and rides were in japanese language so we couldnt understand what they were saying! Furthermore, the staffs there could not really understand english despite disneyland being a tourist attraction. However, they were all really enthusiastic about their job and very patient and friendly towards us:) The fireworks however was very disappointing... short and nothing amazing as compared to the fireworks parade in Hongkong Disneyland which was amazing:) Overall, other than the rides being more fun and having more varieties of souvenirs, i feel that disneyland tokyo was a letdown compared to hongkong disneyland. Nothing special about disneyland tokyo. "
711,5,18-Apr,United States,So much Disney Magic!!,"Just got back from Tokyo Disneyland!  Spent 3 whole days at  the park . What a beautiful Disneyland park it is!  Very clean,lovely restaurants and gift shops. The landscaping is so pretty. I love all the flowers and trees in the park. The cast members are so nice and very helpful. We found everything about the park to be just perfect. On the  2 week- days we were there,the lines were only 20 minutes or less . On the week-end, it was a much longer wait to get on the rides. We enjoyed the parades and fireworks in the evening. I wish we could of stayed another two days at this park. My daughter and 2 very young grand children loved Tokyo Disneyland so much. We'd like to go back one day.The Whole experience was all Disney Magic !! we can't stop talking about it! We've been to all the parks, except for the ones in China. I found the prices for food in the park to be more affordable in this Disney Park. The Blue Bayou Restaurant was wonderful! I ate there on my birthday. I was treated very special and the food was fabulous! The Crystal Palace was another nice place to dine. The food selection was great. We also enjoyed The Eastside Cafe, A table- service Italian Restaurant. with very yummy food."
712,5,18-Mar,Singapore,It's a Small World After All....,"After 15 years, I visited Tokyo Disneyland again.  It's not only meant for kids.  It's for all age.  Though it was raining the whole day with strong wind, that does not stop any visitors to turn up to enjoy the fun."
713,5,17-May,N/A,It was fun,This is a must visit place in Tokyo... it was so much fun and the staff were welcoming and friendly. 
714,5,18-Apr,United States,Excellent ,"This is my 4th Disneyland park that I have been to and I have say this might be the best (Disneyland California still has that special magic), even though they all have something unique about each one. The one thing that stood out about Tokyo is the cast members, they are by far the best in the world."
715,5,18-Apr,United States,Celebrating the 35th Anniversary,"I just got back from a magical trip at Tokyo Disneyland celebrating the 35th Anniversary for four days.  Tokyo Disneyland was truly magical with all the decorations and the cast members were phenomenal and were amazing.  I also saw the new parade as well as the Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade which are both must see's.  I highly recommend Monsters Inc., newly refurbished It's a Small World, Space Mountain, Jungle Cruise, and all the other classic rides. "
716,4,18-Apr,Australia,Happiest Place On Earth,"Whilst a smaller version of the USA Disneyland parks still great to visit.Easy to get to by Disney monorail /train.Very limited English spoken in this park and all shows 90% of rides are in Japanese no English so it‚Äôs a shame for tourists as other parks like Hong Kong, Paris accommodate tourists. However this park has so many Japanese visit I doubt they need foreign tourists to make money anyway. Really aimed at the locals.Priced like most Disney‚Äôs 3 day pass about $220 Australian each 1 day at Disneyland1 day at DisneySea3rd day can go between bothFireworks were not as good as other Disney‚Äôs and are not over the castle like others not sure why.Food pretty average and pricey mainly Japanese food few simple dishes around.Rides were good Well kept park Seems locals avoid these parks when it is raining even a little rain,  so a great time to go.Good to go between Monday-Thursday avoid Fridays and weekends and really good weather as the crowds on these days are insane..If you can stay after fireworks the parks empty quick and you can get on most rides easily between 8.30-10pm Some rides no lines at all and fast passes are available at the rides in the park for allocated times. But popular ones go quick. Longest line we saw was 60 minutes in the week. In all a great experience and it‚Äôs the parks 35th Anniversary so extra parades and some great items available to buy. This runs till next April."
717,5,17-Dec,Singapore,Be A Child Again and Again,"The fun of coming to disneyland is to find happiness as a family and to have fun together. My advice to the adults is to let your hair down and to really have fun together with your kids. Take rides with them and have fun together. Get into the souvenir shops and buy something for yourself. Reward yourself with something, can be anything to make yourself happy. For example, we got ourselves different hats (different character) to keep ourselves warm and blend in the disney atmosphere. Where else can we wear those hats other than in Disneyland. We got there early to queue for entry and was already a long queue. But once opened, the queue was cleared fast and smoothly. Very organised and friendly. We enjoyed the rides and stayed throughout till we watched the evening parade and fireworks. Hopefully can come back again.... maybe with my grandchildren."
718,5,18-Apr,Australia,A very happy day!,"We had a happy day at Tokyo Disneyland and we parents and grandparents enjoyed the place almost as much as our granddaughter!This is almost a replica of  Disneyland in Los Angeles, and with typical Disney attention to detail, everything is extremely clean, well maintained, safe and well organised.  On a Tuesday we did not have to wait long for rides although the place seemed very crowded by our (Australian) standards.  We therefore enjoyed a very good range of rides, all of which were as expected very good and extremely well done. All the staff we encountered were without exception friendly, happy and helpful and we actually wondered whether they continued their constant smiling and waving in their sleep!A very happy day!"
719,5,18-Apr,Australia,Typical Disney,"This site is a cookie-cutter of the California site, but so much more. The Japanese culture of safety and friendliness makes this park a better version of the original."
720,5,17-Oct,N/A,An absolute must see attraction,Japan's take on Disney land is by far the greatest that I have been to.Japan's characters have a Japanese influence and it's adorable! The landscape and attractions are culturally rich and sing with happiness! Disney sea was breathtaking and an incredible experience. The food was such a joy and created memories I will never forget! I cannot wait to visit again! I highly recommend visiting during Halloween üëª
721,5,18-Apr,Australia,Excellent,"Must see if in Tokyo. Our first visit to any Disney Park and I must say Disneyland Tokyo is a top notch. Easy to get there, linea are not as big as in Universal Studios and so much to see. "
722,5,18-Apr,Philippines,Truly magical!,First day in Tokyo is allotted definitely for Disneyland.. my children have been counting the days for this.As expected we spent the whole day and enjoyed the rides. We went on a weekday and it was still packed! Lines were long but we planned to start from the back this time.Shops are all over the area and it‚Äôs amazing how they do their sales as people are somewhat panic buying and I‚Äôm so amazed to see almost everyone wears their merchandise and it would really entice you to do the same.We loved the parades the daytime and the evening one. Very impressive.Our favorite ride was the Star Tours but it‚Äôs not meant for those who have high blood as the ride can be shaky and sharp halts.
723,5,17-May,Australia,Nice,"Prominent service and abundant activities. Recommend everyone to visit here. Worth the price, day trip is suggested."
724,4,18-Apr,Australia,Family visit ,Tokyo Disneyland is much better for children than America Theme rides are good Park clean staff friendly The only negative is lack of staff understanding English Great family day
725,5,18-Apr,Malaysia,Best to prepare ‚Äúgame plan‚Äù if you intend to go for all the rides,"First thing is to buy tickets before hand so that you don‚Äôt have to spend time queuing. And also, 2-3 days before the intended visit date, double check the park operation time as it may differs from the time you last check. If you plan to experience all the rides, expect to spend the whole day there and best if you do some research and prepare your own ‚Äúgame plan‚Äù "
726,5,18-Apr,United States,The best introduction to Disney for a toddler,"This was our two year old's first time to a Disney park and it was the best way we could have introduced her.  There was no one there!  Mid-April and in the morning, all the rides in Fantasyland (Dumbo, Small World, Peter Pan) had a 5 minute wait.  That never happens in Anaheim!  It was so much fun taking her on rides multiple times and not having to wait in crazy lines.  We met Pluto and Donald Duck in Toontown and saw the Magical Lights Parade up close that night.  My daughter had the best time and it was fun to see the differences between the Disney parks.  The longest wait we had was 20 minutes for the single rider line of Splash Mountain and we decided not to wait 50 minutes to meet Mickey.  Overall, it was a wonderful experience and we had so much fun showing our girl the magic of Disneyland!"
727,5,18-Apr,United States,The Popcorn!! Too much fun.,"Disneyland is Disneyland, for the most part the same around the world, but this place is set apart by the flavored POPCORN. We had a blast tasting all the different types. So, there are: Soy Sauce and Butter, Garlic Shrimp, BBQ, Black Pepper, Blueberry, Caramel, Milk Chocolate, Salt, Curry, and Herb-Tomato. At 350 yen each. But, it was fun. We went on Wednesday and Friday and found it to be busy, due to spring break but not terrible. The park was very well maintained and super clean as usual for Disney property. Had a great time!!!"
728,5,18-Apr,United Kingdom,Disney at its best!,Tokyo Disneyland is certainly one of the nicest parks the visit. The park is compact yet spacious and contains all of the classic Disney rides with some nice exclusive additions! If you love Disney theme parks this is one not to miss!
729,4,18-Apr,Philippines,No Parade... No Fireworks!,We went to Tokyo Disneyland on April 11 Wednesday to avoid too much crowds on weekends but it seems no difference. The parks was still full packed and our fast pass on Monster Inc ride was actually 9:30PM though we get the ticket at 4:00PM which we did not ride at all. Due to inclement weather (windy) all parades were suspended and even fireworks so we opted to go back to the hotel after taking dinner at the park. Too bad we missed it again on 2nd time around. We visited Disneyland on Feb 2017 but parade and fireworks were cancelled too! Thats why we went back this spring in Tokyo and included Disneyland again in our itinerary. So elusive and we were disappointed. Its good when we got to DisneySea on the next day we watched the shows and fireworks. I just enjoyed taking pictures and authographs from the Disney casts.
730,4,18-Apr,N/A,35th,Many attractions were closed and seemed to be a media only day when we visited. Even the firework was cancelled despite clear skies.
731,5,17-Sep,Singapore,Happiest Place on Earth!,"This was my first Disneyland visit and I can say that it has exceeded my expectations! Tokyo being one of the most high-tech cities makes this theme park very innovative and attractions announced/narrated in Japanese language makes it even more exciting! Tidbits you cannot miss: 1) Quick eats - Green alien mochi (dumpling), pumpkin churros 2) Merch - The Glass Slipper Glass products"
732,5,18-Apr,Uruguay,Lovely - After 6 PM tickets.,"Nice experience. We got the After 6 pm ticket which was a good deal because it was windy and most children were leaving. So, we got to get on several rides without queuing. The park was a bit dark but the rides were fun. The park is not very different from Disneyland in California. Staff members are really nice.The best part was when we were arriving to the park at 6 pm. There was a delegation of staff members welcoming visitors, shaking hands and shouting. Great entrance! "
733,5,18-Apr,United States,Great park to visit -  better than LA Disney! Lots of special items/promos,"Went for the day and have to say this park is much better than the California Disney!Price for entry was almost half price than California!Loved the clean, orderly, and happy folks here.Food was more Japanese and people didn't speak much English, but knowing how Disney works, made it easy to figure out.Rides were well controlled but Fast Passes were very late in the evening even after asking for them at the machines in the early morning...Best time to go here is spring before the mad dash of summer vacationers."
734,4,18-Apr,Thailand,Great time,Great like it used to be but one thing that I dont like is its hard to find snack to eat. There are too many popcorn shop around park but I want to eat somthing more.
735,5,18-Apr,United States,Happiest place on earth,We took our 4 year old son here and had a blast! Everyone working was enthusiatic and happy. We felt so welcomed. I loved all the gift shops. Both my child and I had lots of fun 
736,5,18-Apr,Australia,Disney Magic - with crowds,"Tokyo Disneyland was the 4th Disney property i have been to. It feels as magical as the USA parks, and it very clean. It was however, VERY busy. I went in early April, on a tuesday, and the lines were at least 180 for the popular rides (splash mountain, big thunder mountain, pirates of the caribbean etc). I would recommend getting there for opening, as i got there at 8.10am and there were already lines to purchase tickets/get through the gates, and I would knock out all the popular rides you want to do first. The metro/train goes straight to the gates practically which is convenient. One thing that is huge at Japan that isn't as big in other places is Popcorn. Not only do they have 8 different flavours of popcorn, you can purchase AWESOME popcorn holders/buckets. These are themed and are sold in different areas, so don't buy the first one you see (they had cinderella, darth vadar, cars, Olaf and many more when i was there). These are so popular because once you purchase one, refills are much cheaper. Almost everyone i saw had one, some were older versions that weren't being sold when I was there! The lines for the popcorn can honestly be around 20 minutes also - but worth it. The food is super themed and amazing, and i would definitely recommend the mickey churros and the mickey glove buns. People line up/seat up for the parades quite early, so if this is something you want to see with perfect view, i would recommend getting a good spot about an hour earlier, or this is a good time to go on the popular rides if you don't mind. Unfortunately the fireworks were cancelled for me due to wind/weather issues. There are no ATMs in the park for foreign cards (e.g. Mastercard or Visa), so ensure you have enough cash. The big stores (like emporium) take these cards, but the little vendors don't. I love this park, and will definitely be back!"
737,5,18-Apr,Australia,Amazing,"This place is a great place for everyone both children and adults.  They have thought of everything, there are some many staff around it you need help finding something.  There are rides appropriate for all ages.  They had popcorn stalls everywhere and plenty of places to eat.  We spent 2 days and got most things done, we did go in the middle of the week, which i think helped with the crowds and we also got tickets to get into the park 15 mins early which were awesome.  I would deferentially recommend using the fast past stations, otherwise you will line up for hours just for one ride."
738,4,18-Apr,Australia,Good and crowded,Been to a few Disneylands. The layout is the same.It was a bit rainy in the evening so the parade didn't go ahead.The lines were so long. We had to wait 1 hour to an hour and a half for each ride.
739,5,18-Apr,N/A,The happiest place on earth,"A solid Disney park. The cast members here make it even more special as they are exceptionally friendly, even by Disney standards."
740,5,18-Mar,Afghanistan,The best place for entertainment,Disneyland is the most and best place I have seen in my life like the USJ.  It worts to visit for weeks to enjoy the beauty of life.
741,5,18-Apr,Australia,Great day!,Amazing day! Plenty to see and do around the park and lots of places to buy souviners! A must visit while in Japan!
742,5,18-Apr,N/A,"Busy, but still good!","Amazingly busy, but still a great experience. You simply need to get there early, like really early. Gates open at 8am I think and we got there at 7.30 and it was already crazy. Make sure you do your research of how to utilize the fast pass system. You need a fast pass to ride to the most popular rides, unless you want to wait 180 mins plus in line. Download an app that shows the wait times (it isnt the official Disney app, but search in app store). Food and toilet lines weren‚Äôt as bad the ride lines, and were actually not crazy expensive. Buy your tickets online before go and have them printed off. Found the official site very hard to use due to payment restrictions on the cards you can use ‚Äì we used ‚ÄúKlook‚Äù and found it very easy and legit."
743,4,18-Mar,Indonesia,The Happiest Place on Earth,"Grateful bought the starlight pass on 31st of March 2018. The weather was great and the Electrical Parade was hold on time. It was really beautiful. However, becoz it's Sakura season and school holiday, the queueing were crazy. "
744,3,18-Mar,N/A,Would be awesome if not so many people,"We did Disneyland and Disneysea over days.  Disneyland we went late afternoon through to about 9pm, there were still heaps of people and the only real time you could get on some of the rides without a huge wait was when the electric lights parade was on as people went to watch that.  If you have small kids they probably won't enjoy it as much as the queues can be from 30 minutes to 410 minutes.  Food at the carts like popcorn etc largely has long lines as well, the food outlets in buildings were not as bad. Easy to get to using the train, you can also buy tickets in some 7 eleven stores and the wait did not look long at the counters so probably cheaper to buy tickets in Japan versus offshore."
745,5,18-Apr,United States,Awesome,"The trip was everything. We stayed at Hilton Tokyo Bay and the service was phenomenal. Disney Sea was everything!! There were rides for kids, adults and lots of things to do if you didn‚Äôt feel like getting on a ride. The Beer was awesome, food was great. Disneyland was awesome as well but it‚Äôs more Family friendly couldn‚Äôt find a drop of beer there though but overall was great. I would definitely go again "
746,2,18-Apr,United Kingdom,Such a let down,"I know we went at a bad time (sakura season) but I wasn't expecting what we experienced at all. And a fair amount of it wasn't even due to the amount of people.When we initially arrived in the late morning, the station wasn't that busy, there was barely a small queue to get in and then it just seemed like any disney park, until we passed the shops and got near the rides...The queue for the Jungle Cruise extended so far beyond that they not only needed ropes, but a woman with a sign that said ""beginning of the queue""!! Somehow that only took 55 minutes, and fortunately was worth it. The ride was great.But after that, we thought we'd check out Splah Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain and hopefully get a fast pass. Well, there were no fast passes, and the queue was 180 minutes (3 hours) for Big Thunder Mountain, and 230 minutes (nearly 4 hours) for Splash Mountain!! We'd have queued for one and they day would nearly be over!Instead we thought we'd walk around the park and then wait for Star Tours regardless of the queue because we both really wanted to go on it. The queue for Star Tours was (at this point) ONLY 70 minutes, so we got in line, and again it was worth it. Now normally, I love walking around the Disney parks. I'm a bit of a baby when it comes to rides so I've spent a lot of time holding coats and bags and enjoying taking in my surroundings. Tokyo Disneyland felt barren. I don't think I saw a single hidden Mickey, the theming was so basic, and it almost felt like a knock off attempt at Disney. Other than the initial entrance area with the enclosed shops and the New Orleans area, the decor was a joke. Fortunately the food was really reasonably priced, but we had to wait for 10+ minutes for a turkey leg to get cooked without anyone saying anything other than ""sorry"" to all of us that were waiting for food. Even to Japanese speaking people, there was no explanation of ""we're just waiting on X"" or anything. The honey popcorn was really tasty though.I also only saw one drink stall the entire time we were there, so if you wanted a drink anywhere else in the park, you had to queue for counter service which was a pain. Jungle Cruise had a water fountain 40 minutes into the queue, but it didn't work. It was 25 degrees C the day we were there, so drinks were a little bit more needed.And the park is tiny!! It would probably only take a max of 40 minutes to walk around it without queuing for anything. And I barely noticed any benches either.All in all we were thoroughly disappointed after 4 hours only being able to go on 2 rides (unless we wanted to queue until kicking out time for only 1 more ride), and I wouldn't recommend visitng to anyone that's been to Florida Disney World or even Disneyland Paris, because you'll be let down immediately, whether it's packed or not."
747,5,18-Mar,Philippines,Traditional Fun,"It's a very nice traditional Disney Park, with the usual Disney rides. mascots, and attractions. Wonderful for those with small kids. They have an efficient Fast Pass System, but most Fast Passes run out early in the day. Arrive before the park opening hour to make the most of your visit."
748,5,18-Apr,United States,Great Time ,"Amazing time. You are allowed to bring in bottle of water, food, etc. Back packs are allowed in park and on rides. Lockers are available. Have 6am breakfast and head to parks, at least 1 hour before opening ... Hundreds will be there waiting for gates to open... Amazing time. Get your free fast passes at rides (need to scan you park Tix) "
749,2,18-Apr,N/A,Magic is Gone,"Way too many people to enjoy. Lines for EVERYTHING! A sea of heads that make it difficult for you to realize you are at Disneyland. Just walking around is a game of Frogger. If you go there expecting to wing it, you will lose. Need the app for ride waiting times, restaurant reservations, and carefully planned out fast pass selections. In between this, if your children would like one of those 'must get' popcorn bucket necklaces, plan a 30 min wait. A stressful experience if you don't have the system of navigating the mobs figured out."
750,5,18-Apr,United States,High Winds but a GREAT TIME @ DISNEYLAND!!,"For all the concerned DISNEY-MANIACS out there ~~ YES, it is well-worth a visit .. .. It was a bit chilly and windy when we went but there was still a lot of people in the park .. .. COME EARLY and plan to stay the whole day .. ..Everything is just familiar enough, and different enough, to the interesting all-day long .. ..All the food is OISHII and of course, STAFF is amazing .. .. And, everyone had no problems with English .. .. Enjoyed trying all the POPCORN types .. .. By far the best was CURRY, followed by MISO & BUTTER .. .. Try them all .. ..And, despite the winds cancelling all the PARADES & FIREWORKS, we all had a great time .. .. And, if you see anything interesting to buy ~ BUY IT! Chances are no other park in the world will have it .. ..THANKS DISNEYLAND TOKYO"
751,5,17-Sep,Malaysia,Best Disneyland in the world,"Tokyo Disneyland is so clean and looks so new and well-maintained. The atmosphere is fantastic as the crowds are wearing the Disney outfit and accessories. The Japanese crowd, even though over crowded, they are well behaved, polite and feel good to see a truly civilized crowd. Highly recommended for those who is first time in Tokyo and never been to Disneyland before."
752,4,18-Mar,United States,Magical Park,"My family (kids 7 & 10) and I visited Tokyo Disney on 3/22/18 and it was a great experience. This was in March so the weather was in the 50's - 60's, very nice and comfortable. We arrived around 45 minutes before the park opened and there was already a line of around 1,000 people or so. Because it was during Spring Break, many kids in Japan were also on break. One takeaway we noticed was that there were not many adults in line. Many of the kids (some even looked like they were in elementary school) visit the park with just their friends. I guess because it's Japan and safer than the US, kids are more independent.Many of the rides are the same as Disneyland so when the park opened we immediately went for Pooh's Honey Hunt which is a lot better than the Disneyland ride. Definitely take advantage of the FastPass which allows you to get another one once the time period for the current pass occurs. Pooh's Honey Hunt is on a trackless track and if you get motion sickness, you may want to avoid the ride because it does have some spins and visual effects which can make people dizzy.The big thing about Tokyo Disneyland is the flavored popcorn. We did notice that around 1 in 5 kids in the park do carry the character container so we purchased one as well. We tried honey, chocolate, soy sauce butter and bbq with soy sauce butter being our favorite. We also searched for different foods that are unique to Tokyo Disney and tried pizza spring rolls from Toon Town and Star Wars mochi from Tomorrowland. Both were pretty good.The daytime parade ""Happiness is Here"" was okay. Our kids liked the various characters but we preferred the Disneyland and California Adventure parades more because there was better music and dancing. The Tokyo parade was very structured with a bike in front, main float and followed by the some dancers. We only spent 1 day at the park but thought it was sufficient. Since we already been to Disneyland multiple times and DisneyWorld, our kids were already familiar with 85% of the park. 1 more day would have been nice but we wanted to spend more time in other areas of Japan. Overall it was a great magical experience and when we visit Japan again, we will definitely make a trip to Disneyland."
753,5,18-Apr,N/A,Get Fast Pass Tickets To Avoid Queues,"First time in Disneyland and enjoyed it. The Lilo and Stitch Musical Show was great! Even though it was for kids, my sibs and I are big fans of Disney. We were given a gadget that has English translation of the show so we could understand it. We regretted that we have not come earlier during the day since all the Fast Pass ticket counters were closed. Queue lines were at 150mins waiting time especially for the good ones. The One Man's Dream show is great but nothing Disney babies haven't seen before.Milk Chocolate Popcorn was the best! There's a different canister worth 2300JPY in each popcorn stall. There's McQueen, Cinderella in her carriage, Darth Vader, Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Mr. Potato Head, Buzz in his box, Olaf, Stitch, Minnie's ribbon. Disney Sea has Nemo, Duffy, Ariel's seashell. If you don't mind walking for almost 20 mins, Tokyo Disneyland is almost 2km walk away from Maihama Station and I suggest to just walk there. Riding the Disney train to Disneyland costs 260JPY per adult. The walk to Disneyland is entertaining mostly because of the views. You can opt to use an IC card to pay or to buy the tickets.I advise others to visit the Disney store (2F) at Ikspiari Shopping Mall (just near Disney Resort Train) to find more Disney princesses merchandise. The items sold at Disneyland is mainly focused on Mickey Mouse and friends. Stores per themed category houses characters or merchandise of the said theme only. There are a whole lot of variety items and goodies at the Disney store if you're looking for more.Also, there's an express train from Tokyo station to Maihama and vice versa. Just ask the staff at the information center to know what time it would arrive.We were there on a Tuesday and the park already seemed crowded. I can't imagine going there on a holiday or a weekend. Check the TYO Disneyland crowd predictor before buying your tickets to ensure walking with less people. For the show schedule during the day, don't forget to grab a map (it includes the show schedules) after passing through the gates. Look for the English ones (I think they're the blue ones). Don't rush here. Just ensure that you get the right map with the schedules so you wouldn't waste time. The park's massive so be sure to use your time wisely in case you only have 1 ticket for that park. If you have a self-printed ticket, don't fold the part where the QR codes are located to avoid any delays. Your ticket is needed in order to avail a Fast Pass (FP) ticket (check the map to see if the attraction has FP) for almost all famous attractions. If you availed one at 8:30, you can avail another FP ticket by 10:00-10:30 (the exact time when you can use it again is indicated in the FP ticket) so be sure to come in early to avoid long queues.Bringing of snacks is allowed. Bringing of lunchboxes or any other heavy food is not. Snacks, candies, and bottled waters are all okay to bring. I suggest to bring a lot since the cheapest amount of food I saw there was 1,280JPY per person. Our family survived by eating 350JPY worth of popcorn every time we're hungry.Lockers are available inside and outside the park. If you wanted to bring your own lunch, leave them there then have an attendant put a stamp on your hand when you go out and eat it so you could come back.Wear comfortable shoes as you would have to queue and walk from one place to another for at least 500 meters every single time."
754,5,18-Apr,Thailand,happiest place on earth,"TBH this is way better than Universal Studio Osaka. Their attention to details are amazing,their rides are more realistic and 3D,their buildings are more beautiful. Plus, the waiting line is way shorter than USJ. USJ's waiting line is almost like 2km long which makes it stressful to queue. I totally recommend getting on Pooh's Hunny Hunt ride. Very suitable for family with small kids.Even adults like me enjoyed the ride very much."
755,5,17-Nov,Malaysia,"Best theme park on Earth, better than Anaheim LA. ","Came for 3 days to enjoy our fav Disney but first time in TokyoDisney. It‚Äôs even better than DisneyLand in Anaheim, LA cos the staff in Japan are always so ever polite, respectful, efficient & hospitable. Whether we are in long or short queues for rides or shows or dining, never have we noticed any staff with a long black face or a hint of reluctance to serve. Having being to LA, we are so shocked that every detail here (Tokyo) is exactly identical to LA‚Äôs. Even the Turkey Stick is what we gotten in LA. Between the 2 parks as to Tokyo DisneySea, we prefer the latter for its more challenging roller costers & thrill rides plus also the props & decos. Anyway, to every staff in Tokyo Disneyland, aligato & thank you so much for your wonderful services rendered to make my family happy. "
756,4,18-Apr,South Korea,"Nice...Crowded, Long Lines & Expensive but Nice","My family and I are stationed in Asia and finally had a chance to take a trip to Japan last week. We made a stop at Disneyland and, just like any other Disney park, it was crowded but nice. Getting to Disneyland wasn't hard with the Tokyo train system but if you can afford to stay at the resort for a couple of days, I would suggest it. The lines were long so make use of the fast pass system. You can your ticket at the booths and get an ""appointment"" to return for a shorter line. We did that with Space Mountain but had to wait 5 1/2 hours."
757,4,18-Apr,United Kingdom,QUEUES!,"Visited with our boys (14 and 10) and arrived before 8am! The park is like all other Disney parks, in fact some rides were identical! Plan your fast passes and be prepared to queue...for everything!! One of my main suggestions is to reserve a restaurant for lunch prior to visiting or go to the restaurant at 10am and queue to make your reservation. If you don‚Äôt do this be prepared for a minimum hour wait for a table! We liked this park (having done Disney at several other places) and it‚Äôs worth a visit!"
758,4,18-Feb,Australia,Didn't have to wait in line very long.,Lines were quite quick for rides. Food carts did have long lines. Especially popcorn ones. Had lots of fun and plenty to see. 
759,4,18-Mar,Canada,Disney at Easter,so many people but if you time it right you will get to see everything you want to. Be ready to walk. 
760,3,18-Apr,N/A,"Disney makes for magic moments, but some mixed feelings with Tokyo","Disney make happy memories and I had a good time there but there are some things they could really improve. Information Boards - Shanghai have got this spot on, lots of information at different parts of the park digitally updated. I realise perhaps 99.9% of Japanese will check queue information on the app but as a visitor I didn't have this option (no cellphone or app). I felt like i was wasting time (to save time) running back and forth to the information board near the entrance. It was updated with stickers (?) and it was just the one board. Come on Japan, you can get high tech here. It would help. China have got this sorted.Tomorrowland - Aesthetically it felt like a blue car park. Shibuya is more like the land of tomorrow! Other Disney Parks have much better feeling futuristic areas.The queues.... they were really bad.The good - Popcorn flavours - really nice choices. The flowers were all very beautiful. The atmosphere is really good. The natural birds, ducks, cherry blossoms, are very inspiring. The prices are reasonable and the service is good. I liked space mountain too."
761,4,18-Mar,China,Magic never dies,"I purchased the starlight pass which is much cheaper than the day pass. It allows access from 3:00p.m. onwards on weekends. There are long queues everywhere though but as a traveller to Japan, long queues are what you need to get used to. The electrical parade is awesome but you need to occupy a nice spot at least an hour before the start. Japanese are all very courteous and disciplined and so nobody pushed and changed spot during the parade. Even if you are not a ride-lover, strolling in this magical place is an awesome experience."
762,5,18-Feb,N/A,Fab Feb 14th,"I have never expected to be that good but since I was with the person enthralled with the Disney culture I could not have asked for more. Emotions aside, the place is vivid and fun. However, there are two advises worth to take note:1) never enter the Disneyland on any Weekend or national holiday. Even on Thursday, we saw huge crowds. The longest ride to wait for was the Thunder Mountain (even with the fastpass). So, come as early as possible and abuse the fastpass system. Because while you wait for one ride it is possible to try other attractions that do not have fastpasses.2) I think I just wrote my second one. The fastpass line. Do note, that during one day it is limited to have up to 3-4 passes. However, while spending the whole day take note of which lands have the biggest surpluss of incoming people and what kind of age are they.For example, the Pinocchio and Winnie the Pooh rides are rather crowded during the day because of the sheer number of families. On the other hand, most of them leave after 19-20 hour, thus, freeing the rides up. It's totally worth every penny. Yes, it's expensive. It is still Disneyland, but the joy was overflowing."
763,2,18-Mar,Netherlands,Long long looooong waiting lines,"After having been in the US and Paris Disney parks, Tokyo Disney was a disappointment. The lines were 2-3 hours each. Even the line for an ice cream cone was endlessly long. Though we got a fast pass for some attractions, we would have to wait another 5 hours to enter the attraction. We simply gave up and returned to Tokyo."
764,4,18-Mar,United States,Disneyland Tokyo 2018,"Disneyland Tokyo was a great experience! It‚Äôs pretty similar to Disneyland in California with fewer rides. The day we went, it was raining and there was still a good amount of people at the park. I wish there were park hopper passes like Disneyland, California. We didn‚Äôt get to experience the Disney Sea side as we were only allowed to purchase one park ticket per day. I heard good things about Disney Sea! Next time I‚Äôm in Tokyo, Disney Sea will definitely be on the list of places to visit. The train system in Tokyo is amazing! It dropped us off right in front of Disney, Tokyo. Wherever you stay in Tokyo, just ask the front desk or use google map and it will direct to on which train to take and transfer to any area in Tokyo! The park ticket was about 70 usd per person and can be purchased at the park entrance."
765,5,17-Dec,Australia,A world of Magic!,"Take yourself into this wonderland of joy! This is the perfect place to take your kids! They have rides for young children, teenagers and adults. Our family loved Disneyland and thought that this was definitely one of our highlights! It‚Äôs such an amazing place to go and your kids will have a wonderful time there. There are so many things to see and do there and at night it is even more magical with lights lit up everywhere. If you love going to these kind of places with rides, music, games, fun and laughter I can guarantee you will not get bored of this place!"
766,1,18-Feb,N/A,Victim of own success,"Visited for 1 day as part of a 10 day visit to Japan. Disney was the original reason we visited Tokyo but turned out to be the least appealing experience of our trip. Visited on a Saturday. Arrived 1pm. Realised Fastpass was finished for the day for all rides. Lined up 2.5 hrs for 1 ride on Thunder Mountain. Was ready to go home after this. Clearly we should‚Äôve done our research s bit better before booking our trip for this time / day (Saturday 31st March).Crowds were out of control. The place is expensive (no surprise). I‚Äôve been to Disneyland in LA which was awesome because we actually got ride all of the best attractions. This place was impossibly crowded and what is supposed to be the happiest place on earth, turned out to be a nightmare on earth due to the sheer numbers of people in the park. Epic fail. Never again. "
767,5,18-Mar,N/A,"Amazing parade, amazing staff!","We went there for 2 days to make my daughter‚Äôs dream came true. Tokyo Disneyland did not disappoint! From the Frozen parade, Happiness is Here parade and the Night electrical parade...they are so magical and it‚Äôs so rewarding for me and my husband to see the look on my daughter‚Äôs face when she saw all the princesses and of course Elsa and Anna.  With a 3.5 years old, it‚Äôs a bit hard for us to go for all rides and our goal to go there basically to share the Disney magic to our daughter. Yes there were some long queue as expected but it‚Äôs Disneyland!!! One thing that I‚Äôm so grateful for are the staffs at the Lost and Found counter. On our last day at Disneyland, my husband lost our rental pocket wifi somewhere inside the restaurant when we had dinner earlier that night. We only realised this after we arrived at our next hotel as we moved hotel from Hilton Tokyo Bay to another hotel nearer to the city center. So he went back to Disneyland almost at 10 pm and the park about to close. Checked with the lost and found staff and at first they couldn‚Äôt find the item in their office so my husband had to fill up papers etc but the staff then said they will double check the restaurant again as it is possible the pocket wifi was still there and no one had handed it in (mind you this was almost 10.30 pm and all the patrons have left disneyland) and then they found it! Such an amazing service and we are very grateful! "
768,5,18-Mar,Australia,A fun day at Tokyo Disneyland,"One of my travel goals is to visit all Disneyland parks in the world. I must say Tokyo Disneyland is definitely the best one I ever visited so far. The entire park is really clean and very organised. Yes, there are millions visitors here everyday. But I didn't feel disorganization at all. I wasn't too sure the day that we visited there is during Japan school holiday or not, but we did see a lot of youth/ students during the day. However, I am amazed how polite how educated these Japanese youth/ students are. For example, everyone is naturally line up for a photo opportunity. No one is cranky up, everyone is so happy while they are waiting. Once it's their terms, each group will take time to take their photos. People really respect each other. I have to say Japanese culture and social awareness are definitely at a different level compared with a lot of countries. I love it and I feel I can learn more from their culture to gain more value for my personal life.There are few things I would recommended for visiting Tokyo Disneyland:1.  Take a Disneyland motor rail/Subway (Whatever you call it) to the park. It is located out of the Tokyo CBD area which it is quite expensive to take Taxi there compared with other public transportation. For example, It costs us around $150.00 AUD to reach to the place from Tokyo metro area (We were aware of the taxi can be bit costly, It is only because we were at a different suburb shopping in the morning. So we couldn't be bothered to find the motor rail station and that's fine for us to take the taxi). We did take the motor rail back to Tokyo station after the visit where the train station is just outside of the park. It is very convenience to travel with these motor rails in Tokyo. I think from memory, the ticket costs around 490Yen (Equivalent to $6 to $7 AUD) per person one way to Tokyo station. 2. Buy a Disneyland theme headpiece (I call it Mickymouse ears) and ware it during your visit regardless your age and your gender. It may sounds bit funny now, but trust me, you will feel funnier if you don't wear one while you are there. Everyone wears different ears in the park, everyone puts their effort in to make this visit even more enjoyable. A lot of students wear their school uniform purposely, so they can just be identical. Some people wear the same clothes, same shoes and carry the same type of bags. If you really don't buy it, at least wear your favorite one and take a photo to bring back some nice memory. Hey, it is Disneyland - A magical world for us...why don't we put little bit efforts in for this fun moment. Enjoy your life!3. Take a 4 wheels cabin size suitcase - Yes, you read it correctly...A lot of people bring their suitcase (small size) with them during the visit. There are thousands cute things you can find there, especially people who love shopping like me... Again you wouldn't feel odd if you push a suitcase around in the park because a lot of people do the same. You will blend in while you are there. There are also lockers available if you don't want carry so many shopping bags around. Don't underestimated these gifts (Packaging of Japanese products are breathtaking, they are all well presented and pay attention to details)...Once you see them and you will lose control...like me : )You will need a full day to visit Disneyland and another day for DisneySea. Take your time and enjoy it. If you have an opportunity, I recommended to stay at the Disneyland Resort for couple days. We really enjoyed the day at the Tokyo Disneyland, Even my ""Boring"" boyfriend loved it and said me that he would like to stay at Disneyland resort for couple of days on our next visit to Tokyo ...Yeah!!! : )"
769,3,18-Mar,Singapore,Too crowded! But still magical...,"We visited on a Monday which was not their domestic school holidays but there were still many students in the park. Popular rides had an average queue of 1.5 to 2 hours. Make sure you go for the fast pass!I have no issues with long queues as it is expected of Disneyland but this time I can‚Äôt help feeling that the speed of the ride when you get on is too fast. For example Winnie the Pooh, the cars felt rushed just zipping from one spot to another. Was not able to appreciate the ride fully in this instance. Somehow having been to so many Disneylands, this is the first time I felt that way. Unfortunately for us 2 key attractions were closed - it‚Äôs a small world and haunted mansion. "
770,4,18-Mar,N/A,Disney was crowded,"Let me first start, by appreciating how organized and accessible is the arrival at Disney resort in Tokyo. The staff welcome, and the neatness of the place is spectacular. I thought at the entrance that it was not crowded because basically there was no waiting at the tickets. But the line for many games can stretch for an hour each, which was kind of not what I hoped so. However, Everything else was pleasant. I recommend it for any family visiting Tokyo but they need to be prepared to wait for long at each game and they should avoid weekends."
771,4,17-Jul,N/A,It was fun,"The theme park is out of the way so depending on where you‚Äôre staying in Japan, it could be a 45min + drive. If you love theme parks and live for Disney then please enjoy. "
772,2,18-Mar,N/A,Hell on earth ,"Wife and I went on March 28 2018. Both very excited to live and breathe the magic of Disney. There was hardly any magic. Mostly it was hell on earth due to the IMMENSE crowding from school holidays. We had no choice but to go on this date; make sure you know when the japanese holidays are and never go on a holiday. Crowds were insane. 200 minute wait (yes two hundred minutes) for the more popular rides, even early in the day at around 1030am. Personally I don't understand why anyone would wait that long for a single 5 minute ride. Hungry? Lines for food are around thirty minutes. People were using window sills as tables to eat their food as all the tables were occupied. Fast passes all ran out by 1230pm. Also, the most ""thrilling"" coasters are all but underwhelming. Very very tame. Sudden left and right turns and that's about it. If you came here for thrill seeking you absolutely came to the wrong theme park. My advice is to buy your Disneyland tickets in advance so you can enter the park without delay. Then, make sure you fully know how the fast pass system works so you can make the most of it, it will help with the queues. And don't come on a Japanese holiday.All in all an unenjoyable day due to the ant-like crowding, taking away from the magical atmosphere that disney is supposed to have, and rides all aimed at children. Not for adults. "
773,2,18-Mar,New Zealand,Prepare to queue for hours,"I have been to Disneyland in California three times in the last 10 years and can say that the waiting times for popular rides in Tokyo Disneyland were a lot longer - it took me about 2.5 hours to get into the Splash Mountain. Between 10.30 in the morning and 6pm, I managed to get into 4 rides or shows. There were just too many people even on a school day. Even to buy food, there‚Äôs always queues.It did not help that some parts were closed for construction. The electric parade was good and the travel to and from the venue was easy by trains."
774,4,18-Mar,Australia,Go for it!,"I‚Äôve wanted to take my Australian children to any of the Disneyland properties anywhere in the world for many years now. So to be here was a dream come true. To finally do this at the Tokyo Disneyland property was probably fortuitous, compared to, say, anecdotes about the American alternative experience. My recent experiences in Japan have all been blessed by the awesome gracious conduct of the Japanese people. So to see groups of young Japanese people really immersing themselves in the flavour of Disneyland, by dressing up accordingly, in pairs or mixed groups, reflecting their favourite Disney character or theme, was just simply charming. The Japanese do naivety so well! Nearly every visitor was thoroughly into their day‚Äôs experience, with their allegiances visibly shown by either their homework preparation or by their worn purchases. So do I really need to mention the ridiculously long queues or the great expense - you probably already know about these. But to share these cons with Japanese people was so much more bearable than it would be anywhere else in the world. Go for it!"
775,1,18-Mar,Switzerland,Crazy waiting times!,"We visited Tokyo Disneyland on Tuesday, 27 March. Thinking that it was a regular weekday, we thought that the place would not be very crowded. How wrong we were...Due to a school holiday, the place was absolutely packed! We originally wanted to go to Disneysea but this was closed for day passes due to the high number of people. So we went to Disneyland instead but we should‚Äòve better just gone home. The lines were crazy! Even to buy an ice cream, you would have to queue for 30 minutes. Fasttrack passes on all good rides were gone and regular waiting times for popular rides were up to 4 hours! We ended up not going on a single ride. I am just not up for waiting in line for 3+ hours for one single ride.We left the park one hour after entering and tried getting a refund - to no avail.To anyone considering going - check the date first and if you go during peak season, go early and make sure you know the Fastpass system.All in all, a terrible experience."
776,3,18-Mar,Australia,"Lines, lines, lines...","Love Disney, love cheesy novelty, and don‚Äôt get me wrong; loved the experience of going here.But it became an anxiety inducing and patience testing experience when everything single thing, whether toilets, food, ride or other attraction, had queues that up to 2.5 hours long (sign posts advise tourists of the anticipated wait time and the longest we saw 150 mins and many more close to this, posted).Still, if you‚Äôre a Disney aficionado, it‚Äôs worth visiting. Just make sure to come on a day that you have nothing else on, and arrive early!"
777,5,18-Mar,United States,"Fun, Tree house","Always feel great Disneyland, even though a long line. 1 day Passport 7400 yen (about US 70). I suggest when you get there in the morning. get a Fastpass first. (how to get a Fastpass look at Disney Sea) Usually assigned time is a couple of hours ahead. So once you get a pass then plan what to do next. We recommend either Pirates of a Caribbean or Jungle cruise, less waiting time. This time we tried the Tree House, where located in front of Tiki room. No lines and enjoyed a lot.  Just up and down the Tree House, but felt so much nostalgic like been in a childhood again. When you are in Adventure land worth trying. Have a wonderful time there. If you prefer short lines, arrive there at 3 PM on weekends for Starlight passport, cheaper and less waiting, Because most of kids start going home by 4-5 PM. Park open till !0PM."
778,5,18-Feb,United States,Visiting in February?,"Tokyo Disneyland is absolutely brilliant! However, for those planning on heading to the park in February, please keep in mind that students are offered discounts to visit throughout the month, which means that it can get very crowded indeed. The longest queue we stood in was to buy our park tickets (we queued for 50 minutes or so after the gates opened) -- we would have cut this down substantially if we had pre-purchased our tickets, which is something we will do if/when we visit again."
779,5,18-Mar,Turkey,Great,"IT'S NOT ENGLISH FRIENDLY! But that's not a problem because everyone is very helpful. The personnel is the nicest I ever met,very kind. It's my first visit to a Disney Park so I wouldn't know to compare but I loved it. Great for any age. If you are well organized  I think you can do both parks Disneyland and Disneysea in 2 days. This time of year the average time of waiting for attraction was around 2 hours. "
780,2,18-Mar,Australia,The lines are insane ,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong I am a huge Disney fan I have been to LA 3 times, Orlando and Paris twice, so was beyond excited to go to Tokyo with my 3 year old.The lines - too much. We got on a total of 3 rides That‚Äôs itDumboStar Wars andBuzz! And fast passes were closed at 11am!! Lines were around 100-300 minutes long each ride. My 3 year old and I waited for 70 minutes to go on the Dumbo ride to me I found the lines for food for the toilet and for rides and believe it or not even lines to take a picture it was just unenjoyable.If you do decide to go, go in with expectations of only 2 rides and if you can allow 2 days. But my advice would be to go to DisneySea instead that was much more enjoyable "
781,3,18-Mar,United States,"Fun, but exhautsing","We really enjoy this park, but it is exhausting. Areas to just sit and relax are few and far between. A nice sit down restaurant would be lovely or even a coffee shop with just desserts so one could kick back for 30 minutes to recollect."
782,5,18-Mar,China,Great fun!!!,"We came to Japan on a five day happy holiday and stayed in Shinjuku. We took a bus that goes straight to the resort which only took about 45 mins. We went on a Monday so it was packed!!! We stayed about seven hours with two young children but they had tons of fun. Most of the attractions like the 4D movie and performances were in mostly Japanese but still our kids loved it. Most lines were super long but they moved quickly. I don‚Äôt know why but the lines for popcorn were somehow longer than the lines for the attractions. My son wanted the milk chocolate popcorn and I stood in line for 45 mins and my wife and son actually finished two attractions before I even got to the front of the popcorn line. Go early as it opens at 8am and closes at 10pm. We didn‚Äôt go to the Sea part but that is for next time. Overall Disneyland is Disneyland, fun and enjoyable! Super friendly people!!!!"
783,4,18-Mar,Singapore,Great fun but tiring ,"The park is relatively small compared to the one at LA (the only other one that I've visited). Popcorn tubs & flavours differ at each stall (Darth Vader head + salted popcorn @ Tomorrrowland, Cinderella Carriage+ chocolate popcorn@Fantasyland, Olaf + caramel popcorn @ Toontown, flying Dumbo  tub is opp Pooh's house to name a few)Food options wise- the food at the Queen of Hearts Banquet hall (@Fantasyland) is over rated; but they do have a good q system whereby you q and pay AND pickup your food b4 you grab a seat. - Huey, Dewey & Louie's good time cafe @Toontown does a good Mickey-head shaped pizza or a chicken bun- if the weather is good, a picnic will be a good option. Before your visit:1. Check the weather & the Disneyland crowd calendar2. Buy and print out your tickets3. Check the park opening hours - may differ with seasons4. Go early - aim to get there at least 45mins to 1 hour before opening time. The queue to go in forms more than an hour before the park opens.5. Plan your route around the park esp if you have small children. There are height restrictions for certain rides. 6. Get a Fastpass for a ride the first thing you get into the park7. Then go and Q for another ride. 8. Take note of the time that you can obtain another Fastpass (it will be written on the first Fastpass ticket)9. Take note of the parade timings and bring a groundsheet (can be found at ¬•100 stores) else can just use an open park map as a buffer between your butt and the floor.10. Be prepared to be patient-There are long queues for the rides/shows, queues at most food outlets and long queues for the washrooms too.Tip: there is a fab babycare/kiddycare room at tomorrowland with separate rooms for diaper changing, feeding, nursing and even for daddies and mummies to use. They sell baby food n snacks too!Good luck!"
784,5,18-Mar,United States,"It‚Äôs Disney, enough said","Here on vacation to take our 17 year old back to where she was born. So where does a teenager want to go while in Japan? Disney. We did not buy our tickets on line which ended up being a good thing. The line for ticket holders was very long! The line to buy tickets only had around 10 people. We timed it that when we bought the tickets the park opened at 8 and we were able to squeeze in at the front of the crowd. Today is the first day for the kids in Tokyo spring break so I think every kid was here. Since it‚Äôs easy to get to by the JR train they just hop off and your here. Everyone runs in and the staff asks them kindly to slow down and walk. That was not happening. Thunder mountain was already a 3 hour line and this place has only been open for 30 min!Will go on a few rides but no way a 3 hour wait. Even the line for fast pass was an hour. Hey it‚Äôs Disney, you kind of expect it. The price to get in is more reasonable than American Disney‚Äôs. And a child price is for 17 and below. Bring your passport to prove your kids are young as they asked me to produce ours. "
785,5,18-Jan,N/A,An American classic...in Japan,"We visited this park in January with our 3 kids (9, 10, and 12) -- an American family living in South Korea. It offers most of the tried-and-true favorites our kids love from the States, with a few fresh twists. One of the kids' favorite rides was Pooh's Hunny Hunt -- different than the Pooh rides stateside. While it was freezing during our late January visit, lines were short -- like a slow day in the States at a Disney park -- so I'd recommend wearing a down parka and braving the cold! Food is ""meh"", probably worse than the American parks, but that wasn't a surprise. We thought the flavored popcorn that is so hyped here was mediocre at best. Overall, though, a great experience, and while I would not make a special trip to this park from the US, it was fun to visit since we are living in Asia. True Disney nuts will want to check out DisneySea next door, as it offers an experience that is unique among the parks worldwide."
786,4,18-Mar,Canada,Family visit ,There were lots of family visitors which were with small kids. They rent buggy for children. They are building new atracci√≥n. We have to come back to see it.
787,5,18-Feb,Taiwan,Who doesn't love going to Disney,"It's been years since I was in Orlando Disney, so I was really looking forward to going to Tokyo Disney. I was not disappointed. Certain things were fairly similar/the same as the Orlando one, and some things had a Japanese touch which was nice. Yes, it was crowded, but when is Disney not crowded. The lines for the rides weren't ridiculously long (but they were at Disney Sea), so we were able to go on quite a few. The Fast Pass thing is convenient, but you've gotta plan carefully as you have to wait a certain amount of time after getting one Fast Pass before you can get another one. Also, you'll have to walk all over the park if you want to get Fast Passes for the rides they offer them for. I was disappointed that the characters in costumes aren't simply walking around the park for photo opportunities. Most of them simply appear at designated areas for a certain time, and the lines to have your picture taken w/them are quite long and in my opinion not worth it. We only had out picture taken w/two characters that were walking around; the others required lining up. The gift shops, though abundant, basically sold the same things in almost every shop which was disappointing. There were only a few unique gift shops, and I was hoping for more. The food wasn't bad, and the prices weren't quite as high as I expected, but being Disney, you know you're gonna pay a lot anyway."
788,5,18-Jan,Malaysia,Disneyland in Winter 2018,One thing good about visiting Disneyland during winter was.. Lesser crowd even it was a weekend! The cons would be.. You probably might missed the night show if weather isn't good.... 
789,4,18-Mar,N/A,Fun Disney park but can be crowded,"We were able to go midweek and the weather was cold so I think this kept the major crowds away, but even with some fast pass options we had to wait for the main roller coasters. Our 3 kids still had a great time and the people watching was superb!"
790,4,18-Mar,Indonesia,nice themepark,nice themepark for familyi was rain so we much spend our time at main lobby in tdl which has large canopywe spent the birthday of my son there so we had the birthday sticker and bought the birthday tshirt for himwell compare to tds.. i prefer tds but if you go with young children this place is more child friendly
791,3,18-Mar,Australia,Good for kids,"Disneyland was great, everyone needs to go once in a lifetime but I wont be in a rush to return. As it was just me and my partner there wasn‚Äôt a lot rides to go on as most rides are for children and the good rides have massive lines. I recommend going about half hour before opening as the lineup to get in is absolutely massive! Once you get in the park, straight away go and book a ride on the fast pass machines, research which rides you wanna do and book them straight away. Unfortunately you cant book multiple at once but whichever you want to do the most book that immediately. The fast pass gives you a one hour times slot for you to jump towards the front of the queue. If you dont book, you will be waiting at least an hour for every ride. Overall, after visiting here and Universal studios, I would say Universal was the better one."
792,5,18-Mar,Australia,so fun,i loved the place. it was so much fun. we stayed till bout 9 and we had an amazing time. i def recommend this place
793,2,18-Mar,N/A,Nice for children,very nice. But there is no comparison to Disney sea which was on several levels above. I would have given up the Disneyland and go only to Disney sea.
794,4,18-Feb,Malaysia,Magical,"My two children loved the parades. Didn‚Äôt manage to get on many rides due to long queues. Most shows in Japanese so hard to follow. Had a good supper at the waffle shop, left early and didn‚Äôt wait for the fireworks at the end, as weather got too bitterly cold."
795,5,18-Mar,Singapore,Always enjoyed myself ,"The trip was well worth it. Even though we didn‚Äôt have the time to finish all of our rides. Need to go again when we visit again. Love both Disneyland & Disneysea. Need to spend 2 days in each. For the kids, it‚Äôs never enough. Our friend‚Äôs kids never had enough of it and always asked to go back haha. "
796,1,18-Feb,Mexico,Deppressed depply dissapointed and very deppressed,"Ok so I've never thought of giving a such a bad rate to something that I hold so close to my heart. But I need to say the truth. I was having a bad time in my Tokyo Vacation, Japan is difficult to navigate and language is hard not many speak english and not to mention spanish so I thought well I need something to take the edge off. And I saw a poster for Tokyo Disneyland. I visited Disneyland when I was 8 years old and I remember little things but mainly that it was the happiest moment of my life. Period. And now in my 35 years of age I thought screw this: Im going to feel like a kid again. I want to take pictures with Belle, sing with Elsa, bother Gaston, yell ¬°Andy is coming! and if everything goes well take a picture with Ariel. My favorite princess on the entire world, from first movie I saw in my life and that I held dear in my heart. I was so excited. So I got to Disney Tokyo, lines were big but advance fast and easy I paid around 50 USD to enter it was 9:30 am I think and I saw a nice band swinging all the Disney Themes. My heart was filling with joy. I started to feel happy. A whole day of being a kid again and feeling happy.I went to have breakfast to a Dinner like restaurant and they offered two courses, Chicken Curry and French Toast I already had a lot of curry in my Japan visit so I switched to French Toast and it was creamy and delicious. So I pull the map out and started to trace my visit. And noticed one pop corn stand! Natural & BBQ. Ok maybe pop corn later. Star Wars first, it was a fun experience and the line was not very long I did around 20 - 25 mins. Another Pop Corn Stand Natural & Cheese.So whats next, I went to Toon Land, oh another Pop Corn Stand Natural and Curry... this is funny maybe Japanese like their popcorn. I got to another attraction and it was more kid oriented. Oh well...I was thinking this doesnt seem like I remember I remember it was much more dynamic, and theres no characters out yet...maybe later...Then an announcement in Japanese along the park started and then the translation in English. Something like: ""We are sorry to inform you that due to weather (snow) the Frozen event will be canceled..."" oh the irony Damn you Elsa!!!! Oh and guess what yup popcorn: natural and teriyaki.Then started to cruise the park and something around 3 of 5 of the attractions were closed. And after walking around a bit more I ended where I started and saw the band. I think I counted 10 or 8 popcorn stands of different flavors, never found caramel the ones I like. And also no Dole Whip. Now I think ok maybe Cinderella is in the castle. And nope. Mainly its a museum of the Cinderella story with pictures and the crystal slipper. And Cinderella looks like a sex doll with her mouth opened in a weird way.To say I was dissapointed is quite an understatement I was actually deppressed. No princess was on sight the only character was Goofy and he was surrounded by a marabunta of visitors. Maybe I remember Disneyland in a different way. Maybe it was a constructed memory. I think I dropped two or three tears for my former self. And went to the exit.  In conclusion: Theres stores of Disney merchandise everywhere, really few rides (that work). No characters. Lots of popcorn stands. The french toast was really good. And the ice cream parlor was closed. Screw me. Most deppresing place in the world. But hey I got the best french toast I ever had."
797,5,18-Jan,N/A,A fun day out!,"We really enjoyed Disneyland, make sure to use the fast pass as much as possible - these helped us do all the big rides twice over. Its good to get the the evening light show early and find a seat, we were unlucky with the fireworks due to wind. We did get to see them but they were very far away and not behind the castle."
798,5,17-Dec,France,Most amazing experience,"This was our first time at Disneyland. It was magical. we tried the smaller less busy rides first and the main attractions later in the day. We went in the winter, and it was extremely cold, so if you are going in the winter take a extra jacket or blanket for the evening fireworks."
799,5,18-Jan,Mexico,Great place and experience!,"The Tokyo Disneyland is an amusement park of the worldwide famous Disney parks.The price of the ticket is around $65 usd you can reach the park via Subway or train.The park has many adventure and character areas such as star wars, monsters inc,you story Etc...It is and incredible place just like.if you were in the Disneyland of the United States.Definitely if you have time and burger.in Tokyo you should visit it."
800,5,18-Mar,United Kingdom,Most Magical Day On Earth,"Tokyo Disneyland has to be one of, if not the, best Disney parks around. Showcasing classic rides such as Haunted Mansion, Space Mountain and the classic- It's A Small World it comes complete with spectacular efficiency and wonderful service from the Cast Members.The food selections on offer are a blend of traditional Japanese to familiar Western and prices are generally what you'd expect. Portions are smaller than the US parks though which is worth bearing in mind.Crowds are the biggest thing which does come to mind with the Tokyo Disney parks however you really have to just go with it. Your inside voice will be saying what the hell, it's a Thursday in February with no school holidays and its raining! The rides and queueing are so efficient that even with insane numbers and Fast Passes running out by 10.30 it will still be a manageable day with a bit of planning. Crowd calendars are really helpful as for a first visit it's definitely preferable to go on a lighter day and there are some good ones out there! If you do some planning, you'll have an absolutely incredible day (and try some amazingly quirky popcorn flavours too!)"
801,4,18-Mar,N/A,Fun Day Out,"Disneyland Tokyo is similar to other Disneylands with regards to the rides which it has to offer. The neon parade at night is impressive and worth staying for.N.B. Be prepared for the crowds! I recommend going in as early as possible to be in with a chance at getting on some of the big rides and obtaining fast passes before they're gone. The queues get ridiculously busy. There was a 50 minute wait just to get on the Dumbo ride (a kid/toddler friendly ride) by midday and a 60 minute to get to meet Winnie the Pooh at Pooh's corner.  Also there shows are in Japanese, not English"
802,5,18-Feb,India,good,Very good to enjoy with Family.  Rides are very good. it was crowded on Non week end also.  One day is not sufficient
803,4,18-Feb,United Kingdom,Day trip to take baby on first Disney trip,"Absolutely fantastic. First Disney we‚Äôve been to outside of Florida that felt like Disney although like a slightly mad version of it! The lay out of the park is fantastic. It‚Äôs like all the good parts of Florida were used and made bigger. It seems to favour all the older more traditional Disney films which is just wonderful.Absolutely loved that they had the characters Walking round the park meeting people like they used to at Florida.It felt very crazy compared to Florida but so worth a visit.They operate the old school fast pass ticket system so get there early to get your tickets as they stop issuing them very early in the day. Queues are slow otherwise.Customer service was good although can you ever beat American customer service?As a vegetarian family we really struggled to eat in Tokyo and this was also the case at Disney, with just 3 restaurants offering vegetarians options. One you had to have reservations for and the other was a coffee house so we were limited to one place and a plate of pasta. It was tasty but still very disappointing to no have the usual lush veggie burgers available at Florida Disney!Our baby girl seemed to love the park and we took her on the flying elephants and teacups as a taster and ready for our June trip to Florida!Everyone is as always very accommodating when you have a little one üòäWe are already planning to come back to Japan for a 2 week break and with a couple of nights staying on site at Disney! So can‚Äôt be that bad üëç"

805,4,18-Jan,China,Happiest Place In Tokyo,"Even though it was very crowded, everything was very well organised. The park is very clean, the staff were very helpful and friendly as well."
806,5,18-Feb,N/A,Amazing just plan ahead,"Firstly I am huge Disney fan but I came here expecting not the typical Disney magic.Boy was I wrong. The staff are all super happy. If they don‚Äôt speak English and 90% did they apologised and translated on phones or called someone over. The park it‚Äôs self is beautiful. The castle is amazing. Rides wore fantastic, yes they had ques but what Disney park doesn‚Äôt. Winnie the Pooh exclusive to Disneyland tokyo was probably the best fantastic.Tips - arrive to the park early. 10 minutes before means nothing. If you have extra 15 minutes for staying in a Disney resort get there for 7:15 latest if not get there for 7am latest. Best Fastpass to get is Winnie the Pooh first as excellent for everyone and goes within 2 hours normally after that do what you wish but make sure you get a fast pass every 2 hours as saves so much time. The parades are best I have seen I have been all but Shanghai but Tokyo just do it right. Parade was fantastic and electronic nightshow was out this world. Mind blowing. The fireworks at the end of the night wore nice but missed that Disney sparkle no real theme to it but still nice (fireworks can be seen from both parks and isn‚Äôt directly from castle to left of castle we stood next to Walt and Mickey bronze statue at centre of near entrance of park make sense when see and view was good.Overall excellent experience highly recommend. Yes some rides in Japanese and don‚Äôt understand but it‚Äôs Disney youCan get what‚Äôs going on.Overall if your in between going just go you won‚Äôt regret it!Last tip go for weekdays obviously check make sure not school holidays but time difference was about 45 minutes for best rides minimum wait time. Also stay in Disney resort if afford extra 15 minutes priceless.Thank you disney tokyo excellent stay. "
807,5,18-Feb,China,It was crowded even on a Monday but we still loved the experience!,"Pros1.	It is Disneyland and the staff is amazingly cheerful 2.	The park is very clean3.	It‚Äôs easy to get there via the subway system4.	While it‚Äôs crowded, the people obey etiquette by not screaming or pushing or cutting         lines5.	Fast Pass can save you hours6.	Relatively inexpensive (get your tickets via klook)7.	It‚Äôs a different experience than the US and much more civil than ShanghaiCons1.	It‚Äôs crowded (we were there on Monday and it was still crowded)2.	Inefficient Fast Pass System (why can‚Äôt every Disney adopt Orlando‚Äôs Fast Pass         system?)3.	Shows and rides are mostly in Japanese (However, you are in Japan and that‚Äôs         what makes it a unique experience)4.	The food isn‚Äôt quite as good and the lines even for a churro are ridiculousTips1.	Get your tickets through klook as the park‚Äôs system doesn‚Äôt let you purchase tickets with your credit card2.	Be there early and take food. They search your bags and it says food is not allowed but people had food and they didn‚Äôt care.3.	Know it will be crowded and accept that fact or else you will be bummed out the whole day, so go with an open mind.4.	Take cash5.	When they first open, walk quickly to your favorite ride and get a fast pass. Line up for your second favorite ride. Finish that ride and then use your fast pass and get another ticket for your next favorite ride. Line up for your next favorite ride and repeat this process. Do this as quickly as possible or you will be screwed because wait times can be 2 and a half hours long for a ride even on a cold, chilly Monday in February!6.	Guys don‚Äôt stare at all the ladies because they all wear short schoolgirl outfits lol."
808,5,18-Feb,United States,The Happiest Place in Tokyo is Disneyland!,"Confession #1 - this was a highlight of our trip to go to Tokyo's Disneyland. Confession #2 - we went without kids. Confessions #3 - We stayed until they closed just to savor each moment! Confession #4 - We sang along with the singers during the Disney Light Parade! And you will, too!"
809,4,18-Feb,Singapore,After 6 passport and 1 day pass,"Disneyland hospitality is great. Visited over 2 days, 1 on after 6 passport and 1 on 1 day pass. After 6 passport was great for us to have a feel of the park before our full day visit. Popular rides are much less crowded, though the darkness prevented us from experiencing the park in its full grandeur. During the day, parked was so crowded, but the whole park experience was still great!"
810,5,17-Nov,United States,Small park but wonderful,"If you have visited the other parks you will find this one small, however, it is nice and clean. It is a must see if you are in the area. On my bucket list to visit and well worth the travel. "
811,4,18-Feb,N/A,A must  to  do thing in Tokyo,"We arrived around 10am in the morning and left at about 7:30pm. This place was amazing, there's lots to do and see from the parades throughout the day  But a few famous rides were closed which was disappointing"
812,5,18-Feb,N/A,Magical,It's very exciting and everyone gets really into it! Adults and kids dress up. The food and drinks are expensive but worth it. The singing and dancing is great.
813,5,18-Feb,Australia,Gluten free food available! ,"Utilise fast passes for rides so you don‚Äôt waste time. You can only use it on one ride every hour though so make sure it‚Äôs a good choice. Apparently several of their restaurants offer a meal with the 5 missing allergens. I can not confirm this as I only tried food at the ‚ÄúQueen of hearts‚Äù cafe. In terms of atmosphere and decor children and adults will love it. I showed staff my gluten free translation card and they were able to look up options for me in their digital system. I had roast chicken, vegetables and rice. It was nice to be able to get a proper meal at the theme park. I visited the cafe near the entrance to the theme park with all of the Mickey Mouse cakes. The only gluten free option is a grape jelly that‚Äôs quite sour. "
814,3,18-Feb,Malaysia,It was OK!,All performance is delivered in Japanese. Less queue time as compared to Disney Sea. Limited rides. More for children. Many of the adult rides were closed for maintenance when we were there.
815,2,18-Feb,Australia,Pick your day carefully,There's lots of information online suggesting when you should and shouldn't go to Tokyo Disney. There's no exact science but make sure you learn from my mistake and avoid local public holidays. Unfortunately we didn't know Monday 12 February was an observed public holiday until it was too late (I usually check but somehow missed this one). We wanted to go to Disney but we only had one day of our holiday left so took a chance. We arrived at about 10:30am and the line to get in was short. Once we were inside though it went downhill from there. The lines to most of the rides was between 60 and 120 minutes. As you're only allowed one Fast Pass ticket at a time the next available slot on Space Mountain we could get was 2pm. Splash Mountain had a 180 minute wait and we were told we couldn't queue (not that we would have for that long). The Big Thunder ride was out of order adding to the length of queues at other rides no doubt. We basically walked around for four hours with a gentle Siberian breeze blowing through whilst avoiding bumping into other people as we pushed through the crowd. I even went on the carousel (20 minute wait) just so I had a sense of getting some value for money (¬•7400 entry fee). We rode Space Mountain once but that proved underwhelming to the point we handed over our other Fast Pass tickets to a couple of poor buggers waiting at the back of the line. As we were leaving people were still flocking in through the gates. I can't imagine how long they'd have to wait for any rides or attractions. I've been to Disney in Paris and Hong Kong as well as Universal Studios in Singapore. The lines were shorter and the rides and attractions were much better at all of them. I'm sure on other days Tokyo Disney is a great place to go but our experience this time was awful and a waste of money.
816,5,18-Jan,Australia,"Usual Disney magic, a must do in Tokyo","Loved this park! The usual Disney magic. Really catered to English speakers, a lot of the parades and other shows were at least partially in English. Most staff members spoke a little English. Staff went above and beyond, the nighttime show was the highlight. "
817,5,18-Jan,Australia,A little cold but loved it,Travelling here in January is quite cold but this means the crowds are not as big and you don't have to queue as long for rides.  Thoroughly enjoyed our visit
818,4,18-Feb,Malaysia,A place to reminisce to good old times,"No matter what age are you in now, your ‚Äòinner-child‚Äô will be awaken the moment you step here; The Tomorrowland. Me and my sister was all smiles to see all the kids in strollers, some are running, some was just looking around in awe because the place is huge! We get to see Minnie mouse and took a nice picture with her. Thanks Minnie, you‚Äôre so warm towards us. We‚Äôre a big fan of star wars so make sure to join the Star tours once you‚Äôre inside and the darth vader ice cream is definitely the highlight of the day for me. Kids will definitely remember this place and love whenever they are here in Disneyland. And don‚Äôt forget to see the parade happening all day long( but be alert on where and what time the parade is on ). Went out from Disneyland and I‚Äôm a happy kid! "
819,4,18-Jan,Australia,It is what it is.,"We actually spent the NY day 2014 here & thoroughly enjoyed our day out.Some friends recently returned from Tokyo so we exchanged stories & clearly nothing has changed, thankfully.How can you not like Disneyland (provided you play Fastcards properly)."
820,4,18-Feb,Australia,Love Disneyland! But bush and some attractions closed,"Very well organised and reasonably priced for one day. A few famous rides were closed which was disappointing. The attractions are very well done, using new technology - more modern than Euro Disney, but a few less attractions."
821,5,17-Nov,Australia,best day of my life here at disney,absolutely loved it here! had never visited a disney park before and cried with happiness when we arrived! the fireworks were amazing and we arrived during the Christmas period so the christmas decorations and evening illumination show were extra special!!! highly recommend 
822,4,18-Jan,Australia,It's disneyland you pretty much know what your in for,So we went the day after we went to DisneySea. We were there from 9 a.m - 7 p.m and pretty much run out of time so we needed a 2nd day really. All the usual rides are there just make sure you play the Fast pass game the right way - get your fast pass for one ride - line up for the next one in the mean time - get your next fast pass at the earliest time and then ride the 1st fast pass ride - repeat. Shows and some rides/attractions in Japanese only so avoid them if you can and don't want to waste valuable ride time. The night time parade was fantastic and the day time parade was good also. We wasted some time waiting for the frozen parade which oddly sung some songs in english and then 'let it go' in japanese?!? Best rides were probably in tomorrowland and also splash mountain. Popcorn flavours are crazy - soy sauce and butter? Go because it is the happy place on earth (one of anyway)
823,4,18-Feb,Australia,Very nostalgic but be prepared for crowds ,"I've visited here twice now, and absolutely loved it both times. I visited on a Wednesday both times as the weekends are supposed to be horrendous in terms of crowds. The day I went had amazing weather, and even though it was in January which is supposed to be the lower season, it was absolutely packed. We didn't get to go on all the rides we wanted (even the fast passes sold out really fast), but we still had a great day wandering around, going on a few rides and eating some delicious, Cute food. Tip: download the Disney Wait Times app that lets you see the wait times for all the rides live on your phone - saves you rushing across the park to find your ride has a 2 hour wait! "
824,4,18-Jan,Australia,Classic Disney!,"Disneyland was great as always! I will say that we did enjoyed DisneySea a lot more but nonetheless Disneyland was still great :) They did not have the fireworks show the night we went and we were quite devastated about that!The staff are amazingly polite, so so nice and accommodating. We stayed at the Ambassador Hotel and Disneyland was very easy to get to."
825,4,18-Feb,N/A,Memorable even for a solo travel,"I was there yesterday and I have to say that it definetely feels the ambiance and happiness from Disney. Though 3 or 4 famous rides where closed, probably because is a week day? Like the haunted mansion. It is great for families and couple and even though I went alone I felt so great. Recommended to go early and visit Disney Sea as well, I didnt have time."
826,4,17-Dec,N/A,Magical Holiday for Disney fans,"We visited Tokyo Disneyland in Dec 2017. It was extremely crowded which was expected.The disappointing part was a number of fun rides were closed like the small small world, light blaster years.The park is very clean, crew members were polite. The variety of souvenirs were way overwhelming!! Ranging from food to home wares to clothing and accessories!Although food was not terrible in taste unlike other theme parks and also the presentation were very nice. Some of the food comes with an option to purchase souvenirs like cutlery or plastic containers in selected characters design on top of the food item.The bathroom were not dirty although can be cleaner, drier in certain ones.There are lots of stroller parking spaces and staff who helped to arrange them neatly.Chocolate flavored popcorn were not well coated with chocolate in fact we couldn't taste much of chocolate. The special Cinderella popcorn bucket cost ¬•2300 and comes filled with popcorn.Pick up the park map right after passing through the security and then the turnstiles. There are various languages in English, Mandarin, Korean, Japanese among others. Do pick up the Japanese park map too as it has more information on eg. what is being offered for that week/month -> look out for the pictures printed."
827,5,18-Feb,Canada,"Best Disney Park, after Tokyo Disney Sea","The staff here make the difference - they are unceasingly friendly, waving and greeting everyone all day. I felt like a special guest among the thousands of visitors. The rides are fun and the park has a sense of place even more detailed than other Disney parks I‚Äôve visited. The other guests are very polite and everyone is having a lot of fun. Despite the crowds, no one pushes, and people even sit and are careful not to block views for parades. Again, the cast members are amazing. Make sure to check out the parades and evening show."
828,3,18-Jan,United States,Average theme park,"This could be because I was an adult, but I wasn't too impressed with this park. I am a huge fan of Disney, and everything else that I wanted to do was closed so I decided to go here. The park is what you would expect: clean and Disney themes. The staff was friendly. The rides were not very thrilling and I was disappointed. I have been to Disney park in the states and I thought they were better. I found this park to be rather small as well. Maybe if I was a child or a parent of a child I would have enjoyed it more. A good way to kill time I guess. The electric parade and Frozen Forever shows were neat. "
829,5,17-Nov,Malaysia,Christmas in Disney ,This is definitely the best and magical Disneyland in the world. Everywhere is so clean and staffs are very friendly. Do come to Disneyland during Christmas season as there will be a lot of special food / show / event and collections! 
830,1,18-Jan,Japan,Many attractions are closed and or break!,"I have been to Tokyo Disneyland about 30 times over 10 years, so my review is based on many experiences, which sadly are all the same.Is Tokyo Disneyland crowded? No, it is overly crowded, but you expect this, so no worries. Although females waiting for 45 minutes in a toilet line during peak season is no fun. I go so often, I have developed a system to keep my family entertained despite the challenges.So why do I give the land where dreams come true a bad rating. 2 reasons.1. There are always rides that are closed. On a recent trip, the space ship rides and go-carts, and surrounding area is closed. To be fair, they are permanently closed as a new ride is being made. I could be wrong, but it feels like it‚Äôs been two years already in construction. With that aside, there is ALWAYS other rides closed for something. Last weekend Small World, Go Go Gadget roller coaster and Haunted House were closed. Last year, it was Big Thunder Mountain, Small World and Jungle Cruise. With the current construction, whose decision was it to close other rides as well for upgrades? Terrible management. As I said, Tokyo Disneyland is very crowded and when several rides are always closed, what happens? Correct, longer lines elsewhere.2. Rides ALWAYS have problems. With the construction, closure of other rides and then closure of the remaining rides makes for an awful experience. This past weekend, Big Thunder Mountain and Jungle Cruze both closed in the afternoon due to ‚Äúproblems.‚Äù This on top of the fact that those two rides were closed for improvements most of last year. Again, terrible management.So, permanent closure of some rides with the construction mess, plus the ongoing closure of other rides, plus the frequent problem closure of remaining rides leads to an extremely disappointing and expensive day or weekend. If you are happy to wait in line for popcorn with only the opportunity to see a handful of attractions, and pay top dollar, enjoy!"
831,5,18-Jan,Indonesia,Themepark for young children,"Since we‚Äôre taking both Disneyland and Disneysea, I might say that this themepark is most suitable for young children. The teenagers will enjoy as well but your little one will be happier here. Doesn‚Äôt mean that adult are not happy here because who doesn‚Äôt like Disneyland? üòÑ"
832,5,18-Jan,Japan,Best Disney resort ever,We travelled to Disneyland Hong Kong. And Paris. And California. Disneyland japan is by far the most beautiful friendly and fun of all. People really get into the Disney theme here in japan. Everyone including adults wear Disney products and even do amazing cosplay. And the grounds are very clean and staff are always helpful. 
833,4,17-Dec,United States,A more open version of the original,"This park has all the classic lands and attractions but has so much more open space. The rides that are specific to this park, especially Winnie the Pooh and Philharmagic, are not be missed. I would also note that the castle walkthrough here is truly a magical experience, with photo reactive murals and effects that are triggers in the space. Since we were here at Christmas, we got to take in the really wonderful Christmas decorations and lights. I don't know if it's more than a one day park for adults, but I still wouldn't pass it up."
834,5,17-Dec,N/A,Dreams really do come true!,"Amazing, clean, great parades, wonderful happy staff.  Lines can be horrendous (up to 2hrs) so my tip would be to do the park over 2 days and split the popular rides over these days with fast passes.  Single rider option also strongly recommended to beat the queues.  Pooh's Hunny Hut is the highlight, and reason why the fast passes run out so soon.  Get there first thing for your fast pass - by 10:30 my pass wasn't until 18:30!"
835,5,18-Jan,United Kingdom,Converted by Disneyland Tokyo,"I've never really understood the obsession people have with Disneyland, but we were staying in Tokyo for 10 days with small children so through it would be a different way to spend a day.We had a fantastic day. We had a3 year old and 5 month old with us so didn't go on any of the big rides. We still had a packed day from when the park opened to about 7pm. We went from zone to zone doing all the smaller activities: boat rides, train ride. We didn't queue for anything other than the dumbo ride for more than 15 minutes. The dumbo ride had an inexplicability long queue but our three old really wanted a go so we waited (it was only worth waiting for 35 minutes if you are three through).We took a pushchair which was fine as outside the rides aimed at the age group there was generally a designated parking place for pushchairs.We really enjoyed the parades and we saw three. The light based one at the end of the day was my favourite but if you stay for that take warm clothes - we were freezing. It is super well organised and even though the park was busy we were easily able to get a good view for each one. It is incredibly ordered the way the first to arrive laid out little mats and sat on the floor so that people behind got a good view.You have to ""suspend your disbelief"" quite a bit as nothing is real here. There was a couple of moments where this really jumped out at me 1) we were on the stream train and it went into a tunnel, normally this means you get lots of smoke and steam coming back over the carriages, here nothing, they are able to turn off the steam but it still be able run just fine 2) on the Cruso Family Treehouse even the tree was made of plastic. I'm pretty sure that even the lovely maple syrup small from some of the food venues was piped in. The park was immaculately clean and tidy - i don't think we saw any litter whilst we were there.Be prepared to spend quite a bit of money, the entrance fee, food, the compulsory soft toys when you have small children. It is certainly not a trip to do if you are on a budget. I still don't really understand how grown adults can get quite so excited dressing up in their disney hats and merchandise but I did leave thinking when the kids are a bit older maybe we should take them to Disneyland again. "
836,4,18-Jan,Australia,Awesome Disney park,"A great park with some fun rides that are  updated for Disney parks. Winnie's Honey Hunt was a favourite (and much better than Anaheim). Overall though, the park feels like a smaller version of Disneyland LA. Insane queue for Toy Story Mania and for the fast pass line which were all done 40 mins after opening. Food price was reasonable, queues were long (have a fast pass plan and use it). Great day. All shows etc are obviously in Japanese which takes from the experience for non Japanese speaking visitors (but it is in Japan so this is expected!!)"
837,5,18-Jan,United Kingdom,Fantastic Disneyland! So magical,Had an incredible visit though it would be less busy as I visited January 2018 so winter but was manic busy! Somehow still managed to get on all the rides watch all the incredible shows. Absolutely loved the electrical parade! Even the happiness parade was fantastic seemed to be really long enjoyable parades! Definitely felt the magic. Staff here helped this they were so friendly and happy and every single staff member seemed to go out of their way to greet or wave to me! Definitely one of my favourite Disneyland's!!! Would hate to see it in summer though if it was that busy in winter!
838,4,17-Dec,Malaysia,Childhood Dreams Came True,Had many interesting places to visit. Love the Christmas Parade. Food was great. Got to eat Disney shape burgers. 
839,1,18-Jan,United Kingdom,Kids will love it you will hate it,"Way too busy. We got there at 10:30 am and left at 6pm. We managed 4 rides! Space Mountain, some wild west ride, pirates of the Caribbean and something else. Queues were massive....hours long and i mean hours! To me this was hell on earth. I went to Disney land in Orlando when i was 18 and can remember going on most rides. Here, it was sooooooo busy that 4 rides are all we could manage. Given the high price of entrance, i would give it a miss and go to Paris or Orlando if you get the chance."
840,4,18-Jan,Singapore,Walk2 and See2,"I didn't take any of the roller coaster because I am afraid of height. And also, there is a very long queue at those rides. So I walked around the park and visit some of those random attraction. I find it very traupetic to just walk around and buy those snacks to munch on. Oh i went on a very cold and chilly day. So most of the time i was finding warm spots.Oh and if you want to take picture with Mickey Mouse, just go straight to his house. Dont waste time lining up at the entrance."
841,5,18-Jan,Canada,Magic,"I am a fan of Disney! It's just beautiful and this park is everything Disney is. The rides are amazing, the staff are kind and attentive and people come in their hundreds. Please work out what fast passes you want and use this to your advantage - we got to do the whole parks rides because we were careful with our fast passes. "
842,5,18-Jan,Greece,Children's Dreamland,"Its a place that you never get tired of no matter how many times you go there. My favorite attractions are the Splash Mountain, Thunder Mountain and Space Mountain. Yes I love all kind of Mountains. If you ever go to Japan do not miss this its nothing like the one in Anaheim / LA nor the one in Paris, why? Because I've been to all three."
843,4,18-Jan,Australia,Family fun,Our day was busy. Not all rides open either due to maintenance  or weather. Not too busy on week days so maximum wait time was only about 30 mins. Make sure you get fast passes for certain rides. 
844,1,17-Dec,New Zealand,We were unamused,"A day of our holiday was wasted at Disneyland Tokyo. The park was tidy, the staff were friendly and the rides appeared to be well kept but that‚Äôs where the positives ended. By 9 am there was an absolute ridiculous amount of people in the park and it only got worse. The wait for splash mountain was 120 minutes at 10 am and other major rides weren‚Äôt doing any better. Even the smaller rides/experiences had wait times of 50 minutes. The fast passes were pretty much all used up by that time as well with the remaining ones for times like 9pm. By 11 am it became a struggle to get around the park due to the major crowding. Food lines were just as bad as rides with 30-40 minutes wait for some soggy fries and dry brownie. We spent 7 hours at the park and made it on two rides. Even the gift shops had limited merchandise compared to Disneyland LA it seemed to mainly stock princess and Disney original character products. Disneyland should take a page out of universal studios book and limit the number of guests to at least half the number who attended when we were there. A rip off and waste of a precious day overseas. Wouldn‚Äôt go back."
845,5,17-Dec,N/A,Best Theme Park for family,"Tokyo Disneyland is indeed the happiest place for family. From the moment we took the monorail to the theme park,  we know we are in a nice place.  The views and decorations were pleasing to the eyes, the park had cheerful vibes, upbeat music,  filled with lots of families with kids.  We were greeted warmly as soon as we stepped into the park.  The staff was very friendly and they really go out of their ways to make sure all patrons have the best time possible.  We were very impressed by the varieties from the 3 separate parades,  2 during the day and 1 in the evening.  Each parade has different dance groups as well as cartoon themed floats.  The night parade was amazing,  lots to see and beautiful to watch. Park is huge and offered many rides,  performances, restaurants and shops.  We were lucky that we visited on week day so it was not too crowded.  The express pass was easy to follow and saved us lots of times.  To top it all,  the night time fireworks and illuminations on the castle was the highlight for young and grown up.  Great job to Tokyo Disneyland. "
846,1,18-Jan,United Kingdom,Worst Disneyland ever,"Just keep in mind that this was their off season as it was winter in Japan. Having been lucky enough to go to the original Disneyland and Disneyworld in Florida, I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm pretty well versed in the standard that Disney tends to keep. Tokyo Disney was over crowded, there seems to be no form of crowd control considering me and my friend had to wade through pools of people almost constantly. They had little to no characters, we only saw a very badly done green army man who was out for maybe two minutes. There were excessive lines for everything! And I mean everything, an hour wait for a bloody popcorn machine! All the food vendors had lines almost as long as the rides!Not to mention the rides, they all seemed to get closed down at random intervals for reasons they wouldn‚Äôt explain. We managed to get to the front of one ride just before it reopened but then they told us there would be a TWO HOUR WAIT even though we were at the front! Because they just hand out unlimited fast passes and so for an hour all the people are allowed in front of you and hold up the queue even further! I mean we were at the front with the two hour wait! That line would‚Äôve been a good kilometre long imagine the wait for the people at the end!Overall they ruin the magic by letting too many people into the tiny version of Disneyland, there‚Äôs no characters you can talk to to balance the ridiculous wait for rides and you have to wait like an hour just to even get a bag of popcorn. We managed to get onto two rides in 8 hours. It‚Äôs a hell no from me"
847,5,18-Jan,Singapore,Tokyo Disneyland,"To all of you who come to this happy place, welcome. Here you will discover enchanted lands of Fantasy and Adventure, Yesterday and Tomorrow. May Tokyo Disneyland be an eternal source of joy, laughter, inspiration, and imagination to the people of the world. And may this magical kingdom be an enduring symbol of the spirit of cooperation and friendship between the great nations of Japan and the United States of America.‚Äî‚ÄâE. Cardon Walker, April 15, 1983"
848,4,18-Jan,Australia,Great fun ,"The majority of the rides are cater for young kids and the waiting time is up to 20 minuets on the day of our visit, so it was quite good.It‚Äôs better to plan beforehand, especially if you have young kids. Otherwise, you‚Äôll find yourself going backwards and forward in the same area.If you plan to have dinner/ lunch in a proper restaurant inside the park, better make the reservation few days before. Some of them are very popular."
849,5,17-Oct,Malaysia,My childhood dream,Tokyo Disneyland is amazing. It makes you feel young again.  Everything is just perfect and makes you feel like a 10 years old kid. Loves it.  Loves Mickey and Minnie.
850,5,17-Oct,Australia,Disney brilliance,Lots to do for all ages. We arrived at opening time ad spent a good 12 hours there enjoying everything. Hard to get into character meets but the ticket and come back system for rides was great. Wonderful place
851,5,18-Jan,Australia,Family with a 4 year old,"I have been to a couple of the Disneyland parks now and I think this one is the best for healthier food choices, polite people in lines and short lines. We went on a Monday and being winter it was a little more comfortable while waiting. The park is the cleanest out of all of them so far. The light parade was fantastic. At time of visit the haunted mansion was not available nor was its a small world. We had the best time. Would definitely come back again."
852,5,18-Jan,Australia,Perfect for young kids,"We had a fun filled day with our 3 year old and 7 month old baby. Our toddler was allowed on all rides (he‚Äôs a tall toddler) and even our baby went on a few rides.The staff are so helpful, the baby rooms are great and the whole place is clean and well set out. We had a double pram and no problem manoeuvring that around.Too many rides to recommend but I recommend getting there by 10am. The park became busy after about midday. I wouldn‚Äôt take teenagers here (might be a bit boring for them) but perfect for babies through to primary school aged kids."
853,5,18-Jan,Japan,Fun filled day,"This was a fun filled day! We arrived around 2pm in the afternoon and left at about 9:30pm.  There was no cue to get into the park as it‚Äôs winter, a weekday and not a Japanese holiday these are all important factors to consider when going to this park. Make sure you check the hours the winter opening and closing times change. If you get hungry make sure you eat before 9pm as all the restaurants start to close around 8:30pm. Overall this was an amazing fun filled day, highlights for us were Splash Mountain, thunder mountain, Peter Pan flying ship, the tea cups, star tours and Pooh‚Äôs Honey Hunt. Space mountain was fun as well but most intense taking a roller coaster through darkness... it‚Äôs fun but also doesn‚Äôt feel safe. Overall worth the time and money. Highly recommend. "
854,5,17-Dec,Philippines,Will Definitely Bring You To Tears Of Joy,"The last time I went to Tokyo Disneyland was in 2013 with a colleague.In December 2017, I came back....with my family this time.I'm usually not the emotional type but when you experience this magical place with your loved ones, you just couldn't help but shed tears of joy.Watching the parades (whether during the day or night) will definitely move you and bring out the kid in you.True indeed, Disneyland is the happiest place on earth!"
855,5,18-Jan,N/A,"So amazing, such a good day out","This place was amazing, so flad we purchased a two day pass to disneyland and disney sea, so much detail on everything, couldnt understand much commentary but we got the jist of it.. Smiles all day.üòäüòä"
856,4,18-Jan,South Africa,Worth a visit,"A walk down nostalgic lane in Tokyo Disneyland! A few key tips 1 - no need to book tickets online- there is no cue at the box office, just to line up to get in 2 - fast pass. Choose your first fast pass wisely as you can‚Äôt activate another until the first had expired. Pick the ride you most want to see and bee line the fast pass line. The lines actually weren‚Äôt too bad and we saw everything we wanted. Straight forward trip from Tokyo. Food accessible and not overly priced Worth a visit!"
857,5,18-Jan,United Kingdom,Fantastic Park!,Fantastic park ! Having been to all but shanghai this is highly recommended! We visited May 2017 and I‚Äôd recommend to avoid Friday to Monday if you want to get lots of rides in as it gets crazy busy! üòÅ They love parades here so expect to see lots ! 
858,5,17-Feb,Australia,The most magical place in the world,You can never visit Tokyo and not spend 2 days at Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea because that means you've missed out on an essential must visit location. There's lots to do and see from the parades throughout the day right up until the fireworks at night just before closing. Don't forget to also make sure of the fast pass facilities to speed up those queue times!
859,5,17-May,India,Awesome,We all have seen cartoons in our childhood but watching in real is just amazing it is the world of fantasy just awesome full of rides full of advanture awesome must visit....
860,5,18-Jan,Malaysia,The best Disneyland I ever been ,"Book ticket in advance. Please check the weather before select the date because it might affect your schedule as well. Also please check the entrance crowd from their website, they will have a date which can see roughly how many people enter the theme park. If you don‚Äôt want to go with crowd, select the less people going date. It can be overwhelm if that day the theme park is extremely crowded. Research on SomeBlogger on which ride need to get the fast pass first then plan the route and your time to see the parade. This can save your time and you can enjoy to the max. The parade sometimes you need to go to wait way early before it start. (You will see a lot of Japanese they will start ‚Äúpicnic‚Äù and wait like 3-4 hours before the parade start). Don‚Äôt be surprise , they always the one who can get the best view. Last but not least, don‚Äôt be shy to wear as crazy as possible or put on costume if you go to Tokyo Disneyland. You will have a wonderful day there!"
861,3,17-Dec,United Kingdom,Disappointing ,"A group of us visited here on Christmas Day. As we had purchased Fast Track passes we attempted to book times for the rides, Thunder Mountain etc. The first time available was between 2020hrs and 2120hrs! Now, considering this was about 1100hrs, we were astonished! Our transport back to our hotel was at 2030hrs, so there was no way that we were going to be able to go on it. A very helpful lady checked to see if we could exchange it for one of the other rides, only to be told that they were also fully booked until those times. The only one available was the Haunted Mansion. Off we went to the Haunted Mansion, only to be told that they were fully booked.Having been to both Paris and Orlando, I have never had this problem before. I find it astonishing that they can be booked up so quickly and I felt sorry for those that were queuing up in the hope of getting on.One other aspect that I was disappointed in, there were no characters out and about for photo sessions that you get elsewhere. Also, all those shops and not one dedicated Christmas shop. I was so looking forward to that.On a positive note, we still enjoyed our day spent there. The parades were amazing and as with all Disney resorts, it was spotless and the people very friendly."
862,5,17-Dec,Australia,Fun,"We visited with our kids who are 18 and 20. This park is a bit kiddie but still fantastic. Pirates of the Caribbean ride is pretty awesome, everything looks very real. Long waits for lines and people everywhere so if you can try and organise a fast pass to get the most out of your day. One ride which you have to do is Winnie The Pooh. Sounds weird but this was our favourite ride. It‚Äôs just amazing. We wanted to go on again but the wait time was 120 minutes. So worth the wait first ride. The parade is gorgeous. Crowds everywhere, staff so friendly and helpful. Just what you expect from a Disney Park."
863,5,17-Dec,Singapore,More geared to kids than DisneySea,The number one place for kids! Much more kid-friendly than Disney Sea in terms of rides and food options.
864,5,17-Dec,United States,Perfect for your Disney Addiction,"This was my first experience doing a Disney park during Christmas time.  It was wonderful! We were there Dec 18th-23rd and the park was not crowded at all. The cold weather took some getting used to considering I'm an island girl from Guam and it's basically summer all year long. Staying on Disney property (Disney Celebration Hotel) helped with the early 15min park entrance.  Busses came back and forth every 10 mins or so and weren't crowded in the morning or when the parks were closing.  There were a few differences as to compared to other US Disney Parks.  There aren't any magic bands. So fast passes were done the original way. You walk up to the attraction, scan your park tickets and get your fast pass.  There isn't a memory maker option so pictures are taken by yourself. I think I saw 1 photographer at the main entrance.  When characters are out, there isn't a formal line for them. You are basically circled are them and try to squeeze a picture in.  There aren't any refillable cups for sale only popcorn containers. Popcorn seems to be very popular in the parks with an array of flavours (chocolate, caramel, soy sauce, garlic & shrimp, curry, blueberry, salted).  Each stand has a different popcorn container that you can purchase for souvenirs and also get refills in them.  Depending which area of the park you're in, thats where you'll most likely find its popcorn container character.  We had breakfast at the crystal palace and were able to view the morning parade from our table. Small world was under renovation and also an area of toon town. Across Disneyland main entrance is Ikspiari (basically a down town disney). We walked there after we left the parks to grab some food and groceries to take back to the hotel.  Overall, it was perfect, affordable and absolutely safe.  We can't wait to return in April."
865,5,17-Apr,Australia,Great day out,"This was our first ever ""Disneyland"" and we were not disappointed.  We arrived by shuttle bus from our hotel around 9am. There were already loads of people but it wasn't too busy. We wandered around all day, staying on to have dinner (which was really good). We managed to go on quite a few rides without waiting too long, although we probably gave the main rides a miss.  We had a fabulous day. We had booked tickets online before leaving Australia - 7400 yen for adult and 6400 for junior (roughly AUD$84/$72). Allow plenty of time here as there is a lot to see and do."
866,4,17-Sep,N/A,Rides for kids,Rides are good for the young ones and young at heart. Disney characters will never fail to amuse you. Expect long queues as usual even on restaurants.
867,4,17-Dec,United States,Great Fun,"Traveled late December over the holidays, so the crowd was larger than usual. Come prepared for cold weather. Layers is recommended as indoors tend to be heavily heated. We found a blanket useful when pushing our little one around in the stroller. Our holiday visit to Disneyland was wonderful! The Christmas decorations were beautiful and the extra friendly staff made our visit memorable. "
868,5,17-Dec,Indonesia,Soo crowded ,"We went there on Saturday, Dec 2. If I‚Äôm not mistaken, it was the first day of Christmas parade in Tokyo Disneyland. The place was so crowded, we barely play anything. But just walking around watching the parades and enjoying the moment with a little bit of shopping time were a good time for us. I saluted Japanese. Even though the place was sooo crowded, the restrooms were all at top performances, clean and the toilet seats mostly has heater in it (did I ever mentioned that I freakin loves the toilets in Japan?). Everyone queued with no fuss at all. During the parade shows everyone seated at the front rows, and quietly standing behind the front rows. Totally a culture shock for us. We loves the shops as well. The curry rice, we need to queued for 1 hour but it was delicious. Try the popcorns!At the end of the shows, the closing time, the over crowded visitors were headed back in order, no fuss. I will definitely going back someday with my family ‚ù§Ô∏è"
869,3,17-Dec,Singapore,Duplicate rides,Much has changed n varieties of rides now are pretty much the same with a different theme only. I went on 19 Dec n was not crowded. Time gap is needed before they grant u access to another fast past. Churros still as yummy.
870,4,17-Dec,Japan,TDL could be one contry,"especially around Christmas, it's really insane. Tons of family, couples, friends etc and you can‚Äôt walk properly, I mean can‚Äôt walk straight because of crowd. Also hard to get ‚Äúfast pass‚Äù on weekend (before noon, it's all gone!) so you gotta make a queue for at least 1hour or 2hours for popular atractions such as ""space mountain"", ""big thunder mountain‚Äù...okay all the ‚Äúmountain things‚Äù haha but if you are with people you love, this long queue doesn‚Äôt hurt you ;)Well I just wanted to say ‚ÄúBe ready for this crowd and waiting time if you go there on weekend!‚Äù Except those two, it‚Äôs awesome! Amazing service, magical atmosphere, heaps of photogenic spots all over the place! Lastly I recommend stay until night because Cinderella Castle looks really gorgeous and all the illumination (even not Christmas season),too!"
871,5,17-Dec,Australia,A place where dreams come true!,Such a magical experience visiting Tokyo disney with our toddler! The lines can be very long so get there early! The parents rooms are amazing and clean too! 
872,4,17-Dec,Australia,Busy but tolerable,"We went here on a cold Tuesday in winter thinking it would be quieter but alas it was very crowded.  It didn't spoil our day as we worked out the fast pass system and having teenagers skipped some of the younger style rides.  We didn't attend any shows as they're all in Japanese, which is fine, but we didn't speak the language and the show attendants told us not to bother which was helpful.  The rides are very tame but good fun.  If you're prepared to line up and wait you'll still enjoy your day as it is Disney and it's as magical as you'd expect Disney to be."
873,5,17-Dec,N/A,Disneyland Tokyo was a blast,"We had the best time here.  I do suggest you make reservations at one of the restaurants that has priority seating as soon as you book your trip.  They have english speakers.  The staff was so helpful.  I was with 2 other adults and 4 children.  We all had a great time.  We were there over the Christmas holiday and the park was decorated beautifully! It was very cold, so dress warmly!  It really did not affect us until the sun went down.  We stayed in a Air B&B that was about 10 minutes from the park by bus.  Tokyo has the best transportation options I have ever seen.  We took the train a few times but I think the bus was a better option, at least to the airport."
874,3,17-Dec,Australia,Good but not great ...,"As with most theme parks the earlier you get there the less you have to queue (in theory!), getting into the park was the easiest part and the morning parade was awesome but for a Disney attraction with international appeal, I would have expected to find more employees who could at least speak broken English (I don't mean that disrespectfully but there seemed to be very little desire to cater for tourists). We were there all day and into the evening and seen very few characters and when we did see them they were whisked away by staff within minutes which was disappointing. On the flip side, getting food and drinks were easily accessible and not as expensive as I expected which was a nice bonus after spending a small fortune in the many gift shops there. We went with our teenage kids (16 & 18) who were only really interested in the rides so it was a good day out but not a great day ... Disneyland in Anaheim is much, much better!   "
875,4,17-Dec,Australia,Wonderful,"Partner and I went in December 2017, what a magical experience. We bought our tickets from Klook and got into the park no hassle. We wanted to exchange our printed ticket for a proper Disneyland ticket, which was done at the Information Centre for 200 yen. Loved Pooh's Hunny Hunt and the Haunted Mansion ride. Got to meet a few characters but unfortunately no princesses. Tasty food, and they make for a good photo! It is crowded and the park is huge, so you may need more than one day to experience it all."
876,5,17-Dec,Philippines,Hong Kong Disneyland would look like a common park compared to this,"Floored at how nice it is here.  I‚Äôd book 3 days for Tokyo Disneyland as a day is definitely not enough.On to the downside first.Not Princess items being sold here, no costumes and the likes (sorry I have daughters) The food will definitely be *well over priced but decent.What‚Äôs great about it - How organized it is and clean - you know how Japan is.  The Parade is nice, explains why people camp out early to be in the front row.  Japanese people are so disciplined that the first two rows of people will really stay in place, they won‚Äôt block your view.  Tip: Same as all Disney parks, run to get your Fast Passes already.As to whether I‚Äôd come back again- it‚Äôs a definite YES!  Already planning my next visit here."
877,4,17-Dec,Singapore,Great!!!,"I like Tokyo Disneyland better than Hong Kong Disneyland!!! They are more systematic, uniformed not like Hong Kong so messy. The toilet is clean, and when watching parade in front few rows crowd will automatically sat down so that behind people also can watch not like Hong Kong squeeze here and there all standing up!!!!! I definitely will come back Tokyo Disneyland again !!!"
878,5,17-Nov,Japan,Great during Christmas time,"I liked that this Disneyland isn't too big. It was great, as there was a really nice Christmas feeling and Japanese people are crazy anyways. So very nice to watch. But don't go there on the weekends or National holidays."
879,5,17-Dec,N/A,Great,"Best Disneyland in the world except for American ones. Better than Hong Kong, Shanghai and Paris in terms of attraction and service"
880,4,17-Apr,Malaysia,Entertaining,"We came so early at 7 am because we thought the park at 8 am, it turns out to be open at 10 am. But still, they were already a big line of visitors waiting in front of the gate. We choose to visit the Disney Sea park because it more suitable for the adult visitor. Some of the stage shows were in Japanese so it was quite hard to understand the story. You need to choose wisely the shows and rides to avoid wasting time. Anyhow I enjoy visiting the Disney Sea."
881,3,17-Dec,Japan,Disney fun,"My first time ever to Disney land and I must say it was way better experience than our visit to Universal Studios. Food was a bit of an issue, but you don‚Äôt go to Disney Land for fine dining or edible things. So fun experience with kids, crappy food. Also, if you are a vegetarian or, god forbid, a vegan.. you will starve. Overall, ok."
882,5,17-Dec,Singapore,Excellent theme Parks for both children & adults,"A dream came true not just for my children but for me too. Yes, it is indeed one of the happiest place in earth. Credit to the Disneyland crew, despite a huge crowds, their crowd control capability is impressive. Excellent baby care center (the best I had been), they even provide baby bottle washing detergent. 2 days was not sufficient to explore the 2 Parks. I think 4 days will be better. Fast food eateries are widely available but if you would like to dine in the restaurants, you need to book in advance (only for Disneyland resorts/hotels guests). Others need to queue and please bother to queue during the peak meals timing as you will not get a seat. Try after meals hours. For re-entry on same day, remember to get the re-entry stamp on your hand when you exit else you will have problem to re-enter later. "
883,5,17-Dec,Singapore,Excellent place ,Excellent place Very easily accessible by train Lots of rides Lots of interesting shows Must see if visit Tokyo 
884,5,17-Mar,N/A,Magical,"Before my visit to Tokyo Disneyland, I had only ever visited Disneyland Paris (a number of times) and wow, this place is like Paris on steroids. It's absolutely magical.The staff are so happy and so helpful, this added to the experience a great amount. The surroundings are so beautiful and the rides are amazing, especially the Winnie The Pooh ride (I never thought I'd say that!). Whilst I must admit, DisneySea has the edge and provides a truly unbelievable visit, this was my first experience of Disney Japan and it exceeded all of my expectations but miles. If you visit, I highly recommend visiting both parks and making this park the first on your list."
885,4,17-Dec,Singapore,Disneyland with Tokyo twist,"We went there during December holiday and sunday. It was very crowded. We had to queue for hours to several attractions, in the end we only managed to ride a few ones. The atmosphere was great, especially the popcorns (bought the bucket and refill many2 times), and also the multiple parades from day to night. As always Disney close the day with fireworks display. Japanese really makes disney special."
886,5,17-Dec,Singapore,Fun for both adults and children!,"Visited for the first time with my family including 3 kids (aged between 13 and 6). We enjoyed Disneyland. The following rides which we tried are fun / entertaining:- Big Thunder Mountain- Splash Mountain- Gadget Go Coaster- Space Mountain (some of the turns are quite sharp, thus the ride is not suitable for young children, etc)- Star Tours- Monsters IncIn addition, the salami pizza at TomorrowLand and the beef steak with rice and the herbed chicken chop with rice at the restaurant at the main shopping area were delicious!Last but not least, make use of the Speed Pass to save some waiting time!Recommended!"
887,5,17-Dec,Switzerland,Great Day out,exceptional service. staff goes out of their way to help. better than disneyland paris. recommend it to anyone.
888,5,17-Dec,Indonesia,One of a kind Disney,"From my experience, only in Tokyo Disneyland people queque to buy popcorn for the very unique Disney character popcorn case. Also the unique taste of the popcorn like black pepper, chocolate, tomato etc. "
889,3,17-Dec,Singapore,Far too crowded in Dec,"Not sure if it‚Äôs the time of year when their locals love Disney but it was far too crowded. Long queues for food, rides, shows and photo taking with the characters. Could hardly do more than 3 shows/rides in a day. May have to visit during summer or other time of the year. "
890,5,17-Dec,Seychelles,Perfect for long Airport layover!,"I had an eight hour layover at Tokyo Haneada airport and visiting Disneyland was an excellent choice! A quick ride on the airport Limousine (bus) left me at the gate to the park for less than 8 USD. There is also a train from the airport. Make sure you use the 7 Eleven ATMs to get Yen for the bus, park etc. The park was so enchanting this time of year."
891,5,17-Dec,Indonesia,Very crowded,"Disneyland Tokyo is very crowded. We only can play or visit 7 place. All games are queing... we were queing in 2 hours for splash mountain...wow! But there is no choice...no queing no playing! Make sure that you have a plan, whats games you want to play. Choose your priority first. Its imposible to play all games in one day.The parade is beAutiful. ..you can not ride a special disney train like in hongkong if you not stay in disneyland hotel."
892,4,17-Dec,Australia,Wide eyed wonder,"Visited yesterday & was instantly impressed upon entering. The overall park is clean and wondrous, we were awed by the happy vibe, interesting fashions and colourful details. The ride lines killed it though, over an hour wait for short experiences and even long queues to get popcorn and food. The most captivating thing was the array of costumes and head wear worn by other guests- now that was entertaining! "
893,5,17-Aug,N/A,The best!,I loved. everything is very clean and with the fast pass you do not take anything to enjoy the games
894,5,17-Nov,United States,Incredible Parades!,"The parades here were by far the best I've ever seen. As an avid Disney fan, and having Disney World in my back yard, I'm often spoiled to theme park magic. This park did it for me, and gave me all the feels you should get! Come for the Christmas events and you'll be so glad that you did. The Haunted Mansion turns into the Nightmare Before Christmas which is just incredible. The Country Bear Jamboree does a Christmas show as well. The Christmas parade, Castle show, and nighttime electric parade are not to be missed! If you get the chance to eat at Blue Bayou, DO! It was an expensive meal but FANTASTIC and one of our favorite meals in Japan."
895,5,17-Apr,Philippines,Dreams do come true,No caption needed. This place is always a happy place for all members of the family.  Be sure to book fast pass for some attractions to enjoy the day. We also booked the entrance ticket ahead.
896,5,17-Jul,Switzerland,Disney is always a good idea!,"Dinsey is always nice an the food is very cute, but the coasters and games are for little kids, I went to Disneyland and Disney Sea and I would recommend Disney Sea."
897,4,17-Nov,Malaysia,First timer experience: Plan your time well,"This was my first time experience at any Disneyland so I hardly had any idea what to expect other than what is shown on youtube. Other amusement park that I had went had shorter lines than this place. We went there when the Christmas deco was up, so some attraction had a Christmas theme i.e The Haunted Mansion. But all were in Japanese so we hardly understand what they were talking about yet we still enjoyed it nonetheless.Choose your rides wisely as some had shorter line (less than 15 minutes of wait) while the longer line can took up to 60 minutes & over. My kid did enjoyed most of the rides even though some rides were too short (Peter Pan Neverland) than the wait. Food is not much of a problem there as a lot of stalls were selling finger food and sit in restaurants were more than enough. Check the website for which rides took shorter time to queue as it can help you enjoyed more rides. Bring mobile power bank if you love to take pictures. We spend near 10 hours there as we did saw the light show at the Snow White' castle."
898,5,17-Oct,Singapore,The best theme park,Really love this wonderful theme park.. the best that i have visited. Big in size and full of fun. Atmosphere is wonderful... must go.. 
899,4,17-Aug,Spain,A Cute Novelty for Americans,"As others have noted, if you are a Disney fan and from the US and have visited Disneyland and Disney World in California and Florida several times, this is a cute Disney to visit to check off your World of Disney bucket-list.  However, most of the rides are very similar to Magic Kingdom in Florida or Disneyland in California.  It is fun to hear many of the rides in Japanese.  I went on a Monday in August when some of the schools were back in session, but not all of them, so the park was very crowded still.  You cannot get park hoppers and have to actually come into the park to get fast passes (the old-fashioned way--at the machines).  You won't need a park-hopper, though, as it will likely take you all day to do each of Disneyland and Disneysea.  It was very hot in August and I wore shorts.  I was a little worried about this as I remembered that women dress a little more conservatively in Japan.  In general, the ladies wore capris, culottes, or skirts, but there were a few women walking around in mid thigh shorts.  A hat is strongly encouraged (and of course sunscreen).  People were passing out in line waiting for the park to open.  The line for tickets was pretty short as most people buy them online and print at home (but you have to have the right size paper to do that).  I strongly recommend plenty of water if you are planning to be the first one in the park.   There are plenty of online guides to tell you which lines will be the longest and the best way to maximize fastpasses.  There are also online guides which can tell you which days will be least busy.  If you have an option for when you will be there, definitely check out those guides.  Comparatively, I thought the park was a little cheaper than the Florida option, but there are fewer whiz-bang features (like no magic band, photo pass, etc).  The Disney cast were all extremely friendly.  A few spoke English, but for the most part, there were no language barriers as it is pretty easy to know what people are talking about at theme parks.  Disneyland gets 4 stars from me...Disneysea, on the other hand gets 5."
900,5,17-Dec,Australia,Amazing. Tokyo does in with style,"We arrived during the Christmas period so the pageant was in full swing. This is truly an amazing place and, despite the crowds (typical of anything Disney), Tokyo put on a brilliant show. Organised with typical Japanese attention to detail and punctuality, we were not disappointed. We didn‚Äôt bother with any of the rides as the queues were way too long plus there was plenty to see and enjoy anyway. We would recommend choosing a weekday if possible as the crowds tend to be a little less. Also bring your own food and drink as not only are the prices expensive but you might wait 10 minutes and more in the queue, even for a box of popcorn! We noted even the restaurants had a waiting list. All in all a very positive experience and, for us, the Christmas parade was worth every penny of the entrance fee"
901,5,17-Nov,Australia,Very Impressive,This was our first ever Disneyland experience and we both enjoyed it thoroughly. We had a day pass and spent about 8 hours but you would need to spend more  time there if you wanted to see everything.
902,5,17-Dec,United States,Very Similar To The Magic Kingdom In Orlando,"Tokyo Disneyland very closely resembles the Magic Kingdom in Orlando - from the layout of the park to the rides.  There are some unique features which are nice, but if you like the Magic Kingdom in Orlando you will like this park as well."
903,5,17-Nov,Singapore,We have a great time!,Spent a day here with our 7yr old boy and we had an awesome time. It was crowded as expected but it was very orderly and clean! Staff were very friendly and helpful. Only thing you have to mindful is that the ride narratives are in Japanese but it didn‚Äôt stop us from having fun. The parades were awesome! Do stay till the evening. 
904,4,17-Apr,Thailand,Cute but long waiting time,Japanese are I to dressing up cute with theme. It makes Tokyo Disneyland even more special!During Halloween parade the staffs will 5each you how to dance along the music!Extremely Kawaii
905,5,17-Dec,Australia,Disney ,What you expect from a Disneyland very clean and if you get lucky and it‚Äôs not busy you will have an awesome time 
906,5,17-Nov,United States,Happiest place on earth,"Disneyland with Japanese touch. The size is just right for a one day visit. It is not too big but covers most of Disney attractions. Our favourite ride is Winnie the Pooh Hunny Hunt. My boy took his first roller coaster ride which is just the right amount of excitement for first time roller coaster rider. Food in this park is surprisingly good and well price compare to its California and Orlando counterpart. Staffs are very friendly and always happy to help. There is even staff in the ladies toilet to direct us to the cubbies when the queue is long. Everyone line up obediently even when it comes to picture taking. This is part of the Japanese culture we love, polite and always courteous to others."
907,5,17-Nov,Australia,Pooh Hunny Hunt,"My first time to Tokyo and first time to Disneyland. Due to tight schedule, I only bought the Starlight pass which allowed you to enter the park after 3pm on weekends. Due to the time constraints, we just took our time to soak in the magical atmosphere and just selected a couple of rides to go on. Since I am big Winnie the Pooh fan, the Pooh Hunny Hunt ride is must plus it came with highly recommended from friends that have been there. It was a 80 minutes wait for the ride but so worth it plus the cool autumn weather helps as it was not too hot. We manage to ride other rides such as Stitch Explorer which is more for kids and plus it is all in Japanese so difficult for myself which dont know the language. Then we only had the opportunity to ride Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, Snow White and of course another spin on the Hunny Hunt Christmas decoration was up during my visit and it was so magical especially when the sun was down and the lights came up.The Christmas parade was also excellent. Overall it was a magical first experience although everything was in Japanese."
908,4,17-Aug,Turkey,Different from other Disneyland‚Äôs ,"We have visited also Paris, Los Angeles and Hong Kong Disneyland‚Äôs. This is one of the best Disneyland. We enjoyed too much. The people are very kind.you can see mickeys and his friends everywhere and you can have picture with them easily. "
909,5,17-Dec,Singapore,Tokyo Disneyland with a preschooler,"Having done extensive research on TDL, I was a little hesitant at first on bringing our 5yo (so many reports on long queues, running for Fastpasses, etc.).However, we are really glad we decided to go eventually and even managed to get on many rides with minimal fuss. We decided on getting an After 6 pass plus a full day pass each.We checked in to Oriental Tokyo Bay Hotel at 3pm and had a nap before taking the Partner hotel free shuttle bus. We skipped the long queues at the ticket counters as we had printed out the tickets at home. Managed to catch the interactive Stitch 'show' unknowingly - it was in Japanese of course, so we could only get a feel of the atmosphere.Following that, a quick snack of onigiri (you can actually pack a whole picnic along) before we went to catch the Dream of Lights Parade which was amazing for all of us.After that we managed several rides at Fantasyland, including the Haunted Mansion and even the Winnie the Pooh ride. This last one was our bonus for that night since we decided to try our luck at 9.50pm and managed to get in within 20 minutes with no Fastpass! (The park closes at 10pm and people were just starting to leave after 10.20pm)We started the next day slightly later as we had had a late night, at around 10am.With rain being forecast, the crowds were quite forgiving. We managed to get Fastpasses twice to Space Mountain where my 5yo discovered her love for roller coasters! Tokyo Disneyland is a must-go especially if you have younger children. Stay at a Disney Resort or Partner hotel as you can rest asap, after a full day of queuing and walking and fun!"
910,5,17-Dec,N/A,Happiest Place on Earth!  ,Made wonderful memories at Disneyland Tokyo which was super clean from shops to restaurants to bathrooms and very baby friendly with proper amenities for toilet training toddlers!  That was very convenient . Lovely cast members who were courteous and knowledgeable.  So many parades that kept us smiling and laughing!  Toddler rides were sufficient to amuse little ones and enough for parents to manage safely!Food quality and choices could be improved a little and prices could come down a little to appeal to more tourists.Thanks for the extra big smiles and roaring laughter!  We‚Äôll definitely be back for another dose of happy memories. 
911,5,17-Aug,Italy,Japanese Disney Magic,"We spent 3 days in the resort, one and half in Tokyo Disneyland and one and half in Tokyo Disney Sea. If you have the chance and the time, please spent at least 2 days per park, since they are huge with a lot of attraction and show. If you have less time, you need to make choices and to have a stretegy! To visit this park, spent a night at the Disneyland Hotel to have direct access and happy entry 15-minutes before park opening.Attractions are classic Disneyland attractions with Spash Mountain my favourite one. Shows are really stunning: One Man's Dream II is really worth one hour wait (you can try the lottery to have a sit, but if you are not lucky you can only go to see the first show in the morning and be prepared to a long wait), it is amazing. The Diamond Horseshoe is also beautiful with a lot of fun, you don't need to speak Japanese to enjoy it but you need to reserve one month before to have a sit. Night show and parade are beautiful, and that is why you would need to spend two night at the park: one for the castle show and parade  and one for the Diamond Horseshow. We didn't have the time to enjoy Stitch Luau but will try next time :)The park in general is wonderful, crowded but tidy.Staff speak very little English but is enough if you need help. We ate at: Blue Bayou Restaurant (you need a reservation in advance) that was delicious and amazing, I prefer this one than the one in Disneyland Anaheim that is anyway wonderful; Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall, a really nice fast food, Alice theme; The Diamond Horseshoe for the show, that was quite good.  Definitely a place to visit!"
912,5,17-Jun,Indonesia,Excellent place to take your kids,"Our kids (aged 3 and 5) had a great time at Tokyo Disneyland. Their favorite ride was the Winnie the pooh ride. If you to Tokyo Disneyland with toddlers then this is the ride you should take. Since this ride is very popular, you need to come early and head to this ride once the park is open. Our kids also enjoyed the Train ride, the Pirates of the Caribbean and the huge tree house. We did not try all the rides as some of them were for older kids and we did not have enough time anyway. "
913,5,17-Jan,Indonesia,Amazing playpark,"Tokyo Disneyland have an amazing landscape, one day is never enough, especially if you want to try the Disney Sea also. You can get bu a mickey mouse monorail to hop from one location to another location there. I suggested yo stay around the shin-urayasu, some hotel provide free shuttle, or at least you can take JR train to maihama station."
914,5,17-Nov,Netherlands,Fun for the whole family,"Fun for the whole family and solid as ever. I was there in November and everything was set up in X-mas mode. Very, very nicely done. Great atmosphere throughout the park. Great and helpful staff but just to many visitors. I would say overcrowded. Waiting lines in some cases took hours. My advice would be: do not go in a weekend if you can avoid it. But apart from that it was once again a very enjoyable experience to be there."
915,5,17-Nov,United States,Wonderful Experience ,We spent 1 day at Disneyland and 1 day at Disney Sea.  We enjoyed the 2 parks although it was crowded we did have a chance to ride several rides and we tried all the different flavor churro's and popcorn.  Loved the different food the park provided from U.S. Disney parks and it was very reasonable priced.  Would definitely visit again.
916,4,17-Nov,Australia,2 day pass ,We brought the 2 day ticket and spent each day at each park. Disneyland was very packed with young families. The atmosphere was very well themed especially since its nearly Xmas too. Disneysea would probably have to be my favourite park out of the 2. The rides were more suited for adults. Do not miss the Fantasmic show!! It has to be one of the best light/river show I've seen and so well themed with Xmas around the corner. I really enjoyed that.I like how at disneyland you are issued a fast pass every 2 hrs compared to USJ where you are forced to buy one which is already expensive enough with the ticket alone. The food is much cheaper here and the turkey leg is sooo delicious!! It was very nice and juicy whereas USJ was very dry. Disney also allow you to bring in outside food.  I downloaded an app which allowed me to see in real time the waiting times for each ride and what time shows were and also which fast pass was issuing at the time. I got my tips and advice from youtuber Tokiyuyu which made both disney and USJ more enjoyable. I brought my tickets from the Disney store in Shibuya. I had planned to buy of Klook (which i brought my USJ from) but i found that it was cheaper to buy from Disney cheaper even after exchange rates. 
917,5,17-Dec,United Kingdom,Great day ,"I‚Äôve never visited this park before and I left absolutely enthralled by the rides, parades and shows. It‚Äôs not cheap to enter but the rides are highly advanced and the helpful smiley staff all add to the fun disney atmosphere. I didn‚Äôt line up for long as the lines moved very quickly. A great but exhausting day in Disneyland. Oh to be a kid again! "
918,4,17-Nov,United States,Tokyo Vacation ,Great!  The Disneyland inTokyo is not big  like the California but is very good.  Some of the attractions are different from the California and is also less expansive than the one in US.  We have a lot of fun there  and if you like to experience a Japonese style Theme Park you can go. 
919,5,17-Nov,United States,AMAZING!!!!!!,"First off Disneyland Tokyo is so much less expensive than the parks in the US!! It‚Äôs unbelievable!! The admission, food, souvenirs... EVERYTHING!! The food is really good here too. The two Parks are the cleanest amusement parks I‚Äôve ever been to too. Make sure you check out the Pooh ride, the electric parade and castle show! The park is decked out for Christmas too and it‚Äôs beautiful!!"
920,5,17-Nov,South Korea,Fantastic day at Tokyo Disney Land.,"I am twenties boy, not really have interest in animation characters, so I did not expect big pleasure there.Though I had seen a lot of Disney animations in my younger days.My expectation was wrong and I had great day there.Characters were so real that I could go back to my childhood, felt seeing movies in front of my eyes.Parade at night was so wonderful because there was already Christmas season. Lights, music, costumes were attractive enough.After that I could watch fireworks, quite long and so beautiful, exactly same as intro of Disney movies.Also I tried some attractions there.Many attractions might be boring to adults if you expected thrilling experience though you could see cute characters there, well decorated.There are some thrilling attractions and I Jet coaster and I was soooo fast and fun, must try it.Use FastPass wisely!I am so sad that I did not went Disney Sea, I would visit Tokyo again."
921,3,17-Nov,N/A,Crowded and very commercial but nice attractions,"Disneyland Tokyo is rather a big merchandising shop than a theme park. First i was really disappointed because within the first 2 hours i only saw 1 disney figure and of course you have to queue to take a picture. Talking about queuing you have to know that you have to queue everywhere. If you want to ride a roller coaster, you have to queue, if you want to have lunch you have to queue, if you want to buy popcorn you have to queue for at least 30 minutes. Even for the smoking room we had to queue... that was really disgusting. The only way not to queue for a roller coaster is the fast ticket system. It¬¥s highly recommended that you inform yourself about the fast tickets because it can save you a lot of time. Some of the attractions like the ""Star Tours"" or ""space mountain"" were very nice and we had a lot of fun and also the disney parade was quite impressive and so all in one i dont regret that we went there."
922,3,17-Nov,United States,Don‚Äôt Travel during November Thanksgiving Weekend,"The attractions are great but the timing of the visit is bad.Tokyo Disneyland during November Thanksgiving weekend (Friday to Sunday) is too crowded. Wait times for the rides averages between 90-120 mins.  It was difficult even just moving around the park. Lines everywhere, popcorn stands even have a queue of around 50 people.I understand that it‚Äôs all about profit but definitely for guests to enjoy the park there should at least be a limit as to how many people can be accommodated at any given day. A situation where there are too many people becomes dangerous especially when visiting with kids or infants.I will suggest reconsider the time of year when visiting this park for safety reasons and ultimately, being able to enjoy the visit entirely. "
923,5,17-Nov,Australia,Disneyland!!!!!! ,"This was our first visit to a Disneyland & besides getting confused at the entry - on where we had to go exactly, we absolutely loved it! We got there around 10am & while that was pretty late since I think it opens at 8am it wasn‚Äôt that crowded. Some rides we had to wait only 20mins which blew me away as I was expecting at least 40mins. We got to see everything we wanted to including the parade! It did get busier & busier as the afternoon wore on but that is to be expected. I can‚Äôt wait to visit again! Next time I‚Äôll stay in the Disneyland hotel cause it looked amazing!! To me the food prices weren‚Äôt as crazy as I thought they would be either! Staff were friendly, courteous & actually genuinely loved their jobs! "
924,4,17-Oct,Luxembourg,Crowded,"This was a weird fall season or the beginning of it in Tokyo. Rainy and cold. The place was so crowded still that entering the park after purchasing the ticket took us 30 minutes. In fact, the staff opened the gate 10 minutes early considering the crowd.Best bet is not to travel in October for Halloween season as Japanese like to dress up and can be a nightmare traveling with kids."
925,5,17-Nov,N/A,The Happiest Place on Earth!,"What can I say... my whole family loved every second at Tokyo Disneyland!The lines weren't too crazy, the weather was great and each land had it's own magic too it.It was my kids first time at Disneyland and it definitely won't be our last.The evening show on the castle was amazing!Thank you Tokyo Disney!"
926,4,17-Nov,Canada,Busy!,"While I enjoyed my day at Disneyland, it's similar to other parks. I would recommend focusing on DisneySea as it's more unique. I found Disneyland to be quite a bit more crowded than DisneySea with long line ups for everything including eating at restuarants. Utilize Fastpass as it makes a difference. The customer service is pretty good I must say and everythi g is clean and orgnaized. It was raining in the morning of our visit and the stopper park areas were not covered. In one instance where it was raining a bit more I came back to my stroller with an open umbrella covering it to help keep the seat dry - such amazing consideration by the cast members. Many of the rides are similar to other Disneylands but I did love the Winnie the Pooh ride - it's reckless and really quite fun. Still a fun day for us!"
927,5,17-Jul,N/A,The most magical Disneyland ever!,I love disneylands but this one is the best of all of the ones i have visited. The atmosphere and spirit was so kind and respectful. All of the workers was always smiling and nice. The parades are amazing and the light parade is magical and so beautiful. I would really recoment no matter what age and many you are in a group. Everyone in the park is dressed up in the Disney spirit and you can't help but smile. Disneyland makes you smile and is one og the most happiest places in the worldüåà‚ù§Ô∏è
928,4,17-Nov,Netherlands,Disney magic,"ITS DISNEY MAGIC....... lots and lots of attractions, clean and perfect bars/restaurants for every type of food. Only sad that fast pass spots are closed very quickly, have to do something about that Disney  ;-))"
929,4,17-Nov,N/A,If you had a choice of one...,"If you only had time enough for one of the parks....I would choose Disney sea cos it's different...But if disneyland is your choice....It's a great place to wander and catch your favourite characters....To be honest, if you have been to one previously, this is pretty much the same thing.Oh..all the shows and announcements are in Japanese...."
930,3,17-Nov,Australia,Crowds and Crowded,"Visited the park along with 70,000 other people. Extremely crowded and it became frustrating more than enjoyable. The staff were friendly and helpful and I guess they are used to the crowds. Visitors were happy to wait in line for the toilets and believe it or not they have staff doing crowd control in the ladies as well. Waiting time for us at the rides like Pirates of the Caribbean 1 hr 15 mins, Splash Mountain 3 hrs 15 mins, All the other rides including Dumbo were over 2 hr wait in the line. When the parades were on people lined up along the route and sat on plastic mats for over 1 hour to sit in front everyone else had to stand at the back. For us average age 60 we were unable to sit on the ground on concrete for over an hour with legs folded. The park was clean and all the parades were colourful, the Christmas theme beautiful. We waited all day for the fireworks to start at 8.30 and at 7.30 it rained so the whole show was cancelled. Luckily all 4 of us that went have been to Disneyland in LA, Hong Kong and Paris. All of these other parks we were able to move around comfortably and have a wonderful time on the rides. If you had never been to a Disney Land you would not be so disappointed. I would not return to this park again unless they put in place a maximum park capacity. Unfortunately once you pay to get in it doesnt matter if you get on the rides or not and at $90 approx a ticket it was not worth the experience."
931,5,17-Nov,Singapore,Marvelous and Magical,"It is amazing to see so many people swamping into Disneyland throughout the whole day. I went there on a Wednesday which reviews stated has the fewest people. I cant imagine what the crowd is like on a weekend.The grounds are big. If you can afford it, I would recommend that you stay nearby and enjoy the whole place over 2 days. There are many rides and most of them are very children friendly. Only thing is that there is a queue for every single ride.Waiting time are usually at least 30 minutes.If you like Disney cartoons, this is the place to go, whether you are a kid or an adult."
932,4,17-Nov,United States,Great park! Lots of fun for everyone! ,I should start by saying we live very close to Disney California and go there regularly. So we are very familiar with the Disneyland experience.This park was great! Yes it's very busy but if you use the fast passes and hit the smaller rides in between you'll maximize your day! We did almost every ride with-in 8hrs! Highlight rides:- Winnie the Pooh's Honey Hunt      -totally different that California Disneys Pooh ride and 100x better.- Canoe ride      - paddle your way around a river and see animatronic animals and Indians- Peter Pan (similar to California but better)LetdownThe only real letdown was the food options. Really not much diversity and not very good. We ended up walking to the Ikspari mall (5min walk) and found a Guzman and Gomez Mexican restaurant that had great food at reasonable prices. There's also a cheap supermarket in the mall for waters and snacks. Disney Parks are always a blast! Use the fast passes for the busy rides and just go with the flow. 
933,5,16-Dec,United States,Awesome experience,"We are originally from California so we have already visited Disneyland Anaheim (many times), as well as Disneyworld in Florida.   I thought this location was way better than the two we have already visited.  First, Tokyo Disneyland is very clean and organized.  People are very polite and friendly.  It was also not overcrowded (when we went anyway).   Wait time on rides here in Tokyo ranges from at least 2mins to 45mins max.  At other locations, wait time on kiddie rides alone starts around 30mins and above. So pretty much, here in Tokyo Disney, we were able to see and experienced all of the rides within a day.  Maybe next time, we will add an extra day just to relax and take it slow.  The shows are in Japanese but my 7 year old son enjoyed his time here just as much.  The light shows, parade and music are just like any other Disneyland, it's magical!  Food and merchandises are a bit expensive but it is what it is. They have a Disney popcorn bucket here that is not available in US.  A must have if you are a collector. I do plan on letting my son visit Disneyland all over the world and so far, I can honestly say that our experience here in Tokyo was more relax due to less crowding.  So even if you have been to other Disney location, I do recommend TOKYO Disneyland to be added on your bucket list.  You won't regret it!"
934,3,17-Nov,United Kingdom,Disappointing,We had high expectations so we‚Äôre sadly disappointed. Its not a big site but was extremely busy. Wait times for rides were a minimum of an hour and the queues for food were not much better. They were very few opportunities to meet the characters. We queued to meet Mickey for over an hour and were only allowed to take 1 photo. We stumbled across Peter Pan & Tinkerbell. No other opportunities. The parades are good but on a much smaller scale than Disneyland Paris & there is very little merchandise marketed with Disneyland Tokyo (could buy anywhere!). Glad we went but wouldn‚Äôt return. Enjoyed the Christmas theme and the light show.
935,5,17-Nov,Indonesia,The Happiest Place on Earth,"The slogan really did describe Disneyland as everybody seem so happy, include all the staffs. They seem so happy and enjoy their work so much, they put a great performance and you can see the air is full of happiness.As you can expect from theme park, especially how crowded is Tokyo Disneyland, the first thing you need to do is grab the fast-pass. The fast-pass is a life-saver in Disneyland, especially for a famous ride. Without this, you might spend 60-100 minutes queuing for a ride. We got 2, one for Monster Inc. and other for Winnie the Pooh - Honey Hunt. I do like the Monster Inc, which make you looking for monsters with flashlight, but get disappointed with Honey Hunt. Even with my fast-pass, I still queuing for 20 minutes for a short and a bit boring ride.Other rides that become my favorite is Mickey's PhilharMagic and Haunted Mansion. It feels so magical when I watch the show. It really like my childhood dream of Disneyland. The only minus is all in Japanese so I don't understand whatever they say, but I still can enjoy it so much.I also fall in love with Disneyland popcorn and their character buckets. Super adorable bucket with delicious popcorn, who can resist that? I ended up with Duffy bucket and 3 different flavors popcorn.Got seafood pizza,and creamy shrimp calzone. both taste so good.The churros is yummy, and make you want to come back for more.We did watch the parade but only from far away. It's really difficult to get a right place to watch the show as it's super crowded."
936,5,17-Nov,N/A,CHRISTMAS THEMED!,"Everything was decorated for Christmas, & was STUNNING! Specialty limited edition foods & Christmas items, great to buy presents for multiple people & very reasonably priced gifts. Very accomodating staff, English maps & signs. Definitely stay for the castle show late in the evening with the fireworks, try to get a good spot early! Take advantage of the free express passes the second you can! Wait times were surprisingly short. I found a lot more rides at DisneySea were more fun for adults & seriously well animated. "
937,5,16-Dec,Thailand,Life as a child,"It's my first time for Disny theme park and I really love this park. Disneyland can take you back to childhood. Nice show and parade. However, there are many people and you have to spend long time for waiting."
938,4,17-Nov,Australia,Pretty good with a little planning,"To beat the hours of lining up for rides,you have to get fast passes for the rides you really want to go on then go on less busy rides or eat etc.. in between..longest wait for us with some good planning was 25mins..which was great considering we heard from other people who waited an 90 mins to 2 hours.."
939,4,17-Nov,Philippines,Disneyland - happiest place on earth,"The family was happy, we were all there after the frustration of the day before. They stopped selling tickets due to the bulk of visitors.It was a sunny day and the kids enjoyed the place despite the long lines and long wait for their rides. The older ones strolled around the place having photo ops with Disney characters. We all sat on the roadside to watch the afternoon parade and we bought souvenir socks, calendars, key chains and the like in shops. We waited for the electric parade and fireworks that afternoon but unfortunately it rained. We went home when the announcement came that the electric parade was cancelled due to bad weather. The evening became chilly so the kids decided to go home. Happiest place to be in for the family but some events were cancelled so we were quite disappointed. Another sad feeling we experienced there were that Stitch's show was in Japanese, we did not understand any of it. But well, disney is Disney. We loved the overall feeling that we were there."
940,1,17-Nov,Austria,"Waste of time, energy and money","Not a good theme park by any measure. Crowded and expensive. Fast lane system not working properly. If you respect your valuable time, please go elsewhere. "
941,3,17-Nov,N/A,Average experience ,"I have been to Disneyland's all over the world and I must say this one was a little disappointing. The actual park was beautiful, most of the staff are friendly, however it's the first park I've been to that doesn't cater for foreign tourists. I wanted to book in for breakfast with the characters for my daughter, however you can only do that by booking online in Japanese üò°. If I want to book a restaurant, I can only book online in Japanese üò°.  I only saw 4 characters in the park, and you couldn't take photos with them. There was no place to buy drinks....you had to stand in food queues for nearly an hour just to purchase a water. Overall a very disappointing experience for a Disneyland, which makes me sad üò¢. "
942,5,17-Oct,Singapore,Simply amazing!,Second time here to Disneyland and it is still amazing! Love the ambiance and merchandise. The waffle with chocolate is a must try! The curry popcorn tastes different from the previous visit.
943,5,17-Nov,Indonesia,A magical place for all ages!,"Everybody knows Disneyland is a magical place. No other theme park in this world could be at the same level with Disneyland. I recommend to go to TDL using bus, either from Ikebukuro or Shinjuku. It's more convenient, easier and less crowded than the train. The park itself is perfect. Great staffs, great rides, great foods and great merchandise. One day is not enough."
944,5,16-Dec,United States,Amazing!!!,As a matter of fact I went to the park on December of 2015 and I must say that the get-go I was a bit disappointed because I was expecting something similar as the one in Orlando but man I fell in love with this one too due to I am a huge Disney lover and the staff is friendly I went with my friend to the Alice in wonderland coffee shop and it was delicious totally love it our waiter was amazing totally pity I can‚Äôt remember his name but if you are planning to go to Japan and like Disney or not you definitely shall go!!! 
945,5,17-Sep,Australia,Must Must Must do!!,"Very easy to access - just take the Keiyo line from Tokyo to Maihama and you're there - you can walk to Disneyland, but will need to take the Monorail to get to DIsneySea. Disneyland is more similar to Anaheim and Magic Kingdom, whereas DisneySea is unlike any other Disney park in the world - both are must visits as they have distinctly unique features that set them apart from the American parks.There is so much to see and do that you probably won't fit each park into one day each. There are so many rides, attractions and especially food to eat!! Too much to be able to write here, but make sure you go on a weekday and plan your day - do your research and have a list of must dos and make sure you stick to it so you don't miss out on anything you want to do!"
946,5,16-Dec,Myanmar,Dreamy Neverland,one day visit is not enough for this dreamy neverland. Trust me. You might feel like a child once again you step inside. There is disneyland hotel right beside the amusement park and its structure is that of a mansion. It makes you feel like a princess!! They also have disney parade and disney story show at the Cinderella castle every night.
947,3,17-Oct,Philippines,Disneyland an Experience,"Used google map to look for Disneyland. Station is Maihama. Relatively easy. It was a Sunday and it was crowded. The rides are more or less same, except instructions in Japanese, Food are oriental, Japanese and western. Japanese loves wearing disney costume, even teens, it was a sight. Waiting time is longer as many availed of fast lane. There were halloween parade which I missed due to rain. The fireworks was short compare to other Disneylands. The electric parade was cancelled due to the rain, but we stayed on for the fireworks after we found some shade. It was cold but rainy and not that fun due to the weather, but this is disneyland."
948,3,17-Nov,United Kingdom,Ok but dated - choose Disney Sea instead ,"Visited on a Tuesday in mid-November. Crowd levels were OK, busy but not the huge crowds people have been talking about on here. Most rides were about 60 mins wait. Overall disappointed with this park. Many things felt very dated and like it needed a rethink. The Western/Adventure theming areas were enjoyable, but the rest of the park was disjointed. Physically huge but with no more to do than Disneyland Paris, so Tokyo feels empty and a little soulless. Parades and shows were sensational however. Don‚Äôt miss the electrical parade. There were more things for under 10s and 5s than the whole family. If you are short for time, just visit Disney Sea instead. It is next door and far superior"
949,5,17-Oct,Malaysia,Lots of fun :),"I visited Tokyo Disneyland with a group of friends a week ago, very beautiful place except it can get super crowded especially in the weekends so beware! Pretty sure it's going to get even more crowded in the coming month since Christmas is coming up. Lines were quite long at most attractions, but well worth the wait i would say :) Overall a pretty magical day.Would definitely suggest buying tickets in advance online to avoid long queues at the ticket counter. We bought tickets from Klook, which was a pretty pleasant experience as we didn't need to line up, just had to show our printed voucher. We booked under a promo, not sure if it's still running though."
950,5,17-Oct,Philippines,Magical Halloween,It was indeed magical and it was more festive on Oct 31st were most people young and old were dressed as Disney characters. The lines were long but still you'll enjoy the place. They have a lot of great rides. TipGo there early (went there in the afternoon)Train ride is not that difficult just have to read the directions properly.You can bring your own food and snacks just bring them discreetly.
951,5,17-Jun,United Kingdom,Great Fun,"We went to Tokyo Disney on a Friday during the summer time. It was very hot and as usual Disneyland is always busy. Having said that, it wasn't too crowded and the most we waited in line for was about 30-40 minutes (most of the rides were 20 mins) but a parade was going by at the same time so it never felt that long and the line was continuously moving. There were plenty of refreshment stands so we never felt unbearably hot either. If you've been to Disneyland Paris the layout is very much the same but Disney is always magical and the lights parade was stunning."
952,3,17-Nov,Singapore,Way overcrowded park even on off peak season,This park is only suitable for people who are willing to visit cos of certain rides or that they have more than a day to visit it. Full serviced restaurants were fully booked almost immediately after opening for booking 1 month in advance. On a less crowded day be prepared to wait 15-20 min on average to queue for a full set of main course. 30 min or more for the popular food during lunch hours. Most rides are similar to what you will get in other Disneyland. There were plenty of families with kids in tow. The baby Centre is always crowded and packed with babies and parents. On avg we had to wait at least 30-60 min for a ride. This isn‚Äôt that ideal if u have a baby who cannot handle the wait for too long. Service staff were helpful in pointing us to the direction of whichever food/attraction. This is in line with the usual Japanese service staff always smiling and willing to help you.All in all it was an ok experience but way overcrowded considering we went during a non peak season and low according to the crowd calendar. 
953,3,17-Oct,China,Lovely park but some attractions just don't worth the long wait,"It's my second visit to Tokyo Disneyland, last visit being 10 years ago. Being a Disney fan and frequent visitor of other Disneylands, I must say this visit to Tokyo DL wasn't as magical as it was (I did have high expectation). The park is still lovely and I still enjoy Disneyland. I guess what made it less magical this time were the close down (or late opening) of some major rides, the crowds and the cancellation of fireworks (it's really disappointing when you have stood at the perfect spot for an hour waiting for the fireworks to end the magical day but I know it's all up to the weather). Also, I was quite surprised there were so few live shows, and when there was one, it's in Japanese.But I have to say, the cast members were wonderful. They were so friendly and helpful, sharing joy with guests, simply can't say anything bad about them. And though I said the crowd made the day less magical, I did enjoy very much watching people dressing up as different Disney characters. It was a delight to see how much effort people put into dressing up!"
954,5,17-Nov,United Kingdom,Tokyo Disney ,The highlight of the day was One Mans Dream ll which is a 30 minute live stage performance of characters and dancers who provide the audience with a spectacular show on a par with Broadway. Watching the children‚Äôs faces was particularly special. The parade was brilliant. As from a dining experience the better eating place was East Side cafe for ambience. Polynesian evening is pleasant although impossible for non Japanese to go unless you are very determined. 
955,4,17-Oct,United Kingdom,Had a wonderful day ,I had a lovely day with my husband here. The parades were fabulous and it had a real charm. üòä Would definitely come back next time we are in Japan. 
956,4,17-Oct,Australia,Enjoyed our 2 days here ,"My friend and I are Disney mad and have never been to any of the other Disney parks so we decided to spend 2 days at Disneyland and 1 at Disney sea. I‚Äôd definitely recommend 2 days to see everything. The park is located just a short walk from JR Maihama station. My friend and I do not speak any Japanese besides basic things we remember from highschool.Menus and the safety Instructions on rides are in English but the dialogue on rides and in shows is in Japanese. We were usually able to figure out what was going on but it definitely added an extra thrill to some of the thrill rides when we didn‚Äôt know what was going on. A few tips from our experience: - You can get a map and a list of showtimes (both available in English) at the entry but you have to ask for them -even in pouring rain, the park was still busy on a Saturday and ride wait times got up to two hours so expect crowds and lines-Definitely recommend getting a fast pass (a free service that allows you to come back and ride later)for a ride as soon as you arrive at the park and then another as soon as you can. The lines for the fast pass rides get quite long. On our first day we got 1 fast pass and rode the ride but by the time we were finished they‚Äôd reached capacity for fast passes for the day and we were unable to get another. -When you fast pass, you have an hour time slot to enter the ride so we found getting the next fast pass before the ride more effective. -In my opinion, though rides were cool, we didn‚Äôt think most of them were worth a 2 hour wait. Though I loved space mountain (we rode it 3 times) so that one probably is. -If you stay until the park closes and there‚Äôs a ride you‚Äôd like to go on, head straight over there after the last once upon a time castle projection, the queues are normally much shorter. We did this for the Winnie the Pooh ride and were on the ride within around 10 minutes (lines had been around 2 hours for this ride). "
957,4,17-Jun,Philippines,A bit dated but the Disney magic is very much alive,"Kids (and the ""kid"" at heart) will enjoy Tokyo Disneyland. The happiest place in the world (with a Japanese flavor) was packed even on a weekday. We arrived there an hour before it opened as advised by the local residents; it was an advice well appreciated. Although the rides and attractions are a bit dated (renovations are being done in parts of the park), visitors are still lining up patiently for their turn. Not much variety on food and drinks though. Tokyo Disneyland is very accessible via the Tokyo subway/train network Just a ride away from the Tokyo Station."
958,5,17-Sep,Philippines,Good for kids,"Like any other theme parks, do not expect the place to be empty.  Since this is Disney, even weekdays are packed!  However, I think it is part of the experience.  The kids really loved it and you can see the joy in their eyes and that makes all the trouble worth it."
959,1,17-Nov,United States,0 out of 5 stars. Crammed like human cattle all day.,"If you want to experience what its like to ride the Tokyo Subway during peak hour for 10 hours straight then head to Disneyland. I could barely move in this park, it was shoulder to shoulder everywhere, absolutely crammed with Japanese high school students, mums and kids.  The entire park was absolutely flooded with visitors as far as the eye could see.We went on the supposedly ""quiet"" Wednesday when crowds were supposed to be at their lowest and it wasnt school holidays either.To give you an idea of why this park should be renamed ""Sardine Land"" instead of Disney Land, we got there at 8:30am and the line for Space Mountain was already 90 mins. Yes, that's 30 mins after the park was 'open'. Apparently 1000's of people camp outside the park from 6am, queuing inline so they can sprint to the ride of their choice when the park opens 2 hours laterAt 10am, the earliest ""fast pass"" for Poohs Honey Hunt was 9.10pm at night.After 9am, the queues for the major rides exceeded 3 hours.To even buy popcorn the queue was 40 mins.I wouldn't be surprised if Scrooge McDuck himself was the CEO of this park attempting to flood the park with visitors to maximize money for himself.Its a real pity for the great staff who work here having such selfish and greedy Bosses.Management need to cap visitor numbers.I wont be visiting anymore Disney theme parks."
960,5,17-Oct,N/A,fun day,Awesome rides and service it was a good fun day. Cues sometimes long but moved effivciently. Lots of free activities and no additional cost except for fast tracking the popular rides if you chose to.
961,4,17-Nov,N/A,DisneyLand is good to child and family,"If you think about visit DisneyLand with your family or child, That's very good choice! I love DisneyLand!!"
962,5,17-Nov,Singapore,Fairytale,"My third visit, still enchanted. Escape from reality and into fairytale land for a day . I love Disneyland in Japan because people and polite and behave and queue in an orderly manner. No stress, no temper just plain old fan . Was there on Halloween and it was so much fan . Lovely."
963,4,17-Oct,Singapore,a magical rain!,"My trip was a week before the typhoon. So, it was raining all day. I didn't take a lot of ride during the visit as mostly I could find elsewhere (I visited Anaheim and Shanghai as well). But, it turned out the Winnie The Pooh ride was very lovely and the queue was quite long until night. I was able to secure my Fastpass ticket. I collected around 10 am and got my time on 8 pm. OMG! Most fastpast tickets were sold out at 10pm. The ""it's small world"" attraction was being upgraded and we were disappointed to not try it as my mom was requested. Nothing is enjoyable while is raining intensely all day."
964,1,17-Oct,Australia,Awful,"Despite arriving at opening time, this place was bedlam. I have been to other resorts and was pretty appalled at the queues , the fact that even getting in to eat lunch took an hour of queueing . Give it a big miss. Bloody awful"
965,4,17-Oct,Australia,Nice day out. ,We had a nice time at Disneyland. It was raining all day which probably made it a little harder to enjoy with 3 children but we made the most of it. The rides were more suited to younger children. The shows were all in Japanese so we could not understand what was going on but it was a good experience. The food was reasonable price. To be honest I felt Disneysea was 10x better then Disneyland. 
966,5,17-Sep,New Zealand,Most magical place on earth (or one of them),"Disneyland is simply magic! That is the best way to describe it, absolute magic! We bought a 3 day pass for both Disneyland and DisneySea. We loved both of them!The whole place is absolutely delightful!! All the staff are wonderful, friendly and happy! The rides are lots of fun and there's heaps to do.The parades are absolute magic! There's a few parades throughout the day and they are all as good as each other. It really is the happiest place on earth! Seems very obvious but for English speaking tourists, most of the rides and shows are in Japanese so be mindful of that. The performances around the park are in Japanese too and it is beautiful ! The level of talent of all the performers is insane!Important to get there early in the day and try and get fast passes for the rides. The way the fast passes work: Take your disneyland ticket to the ride you want to go on (choose one with a long wait time that you really want to go on). Go to the fast pass machine located nearby the rides  - there should be a clock nearby to tell you what fast pass times they are allocating. Go to a fast pass machine and scan your ticket under it. The machine spits out a little ticket with an hour allocated spot for you to return for the ride. Return to the ride at the allocated time and skip the queue! (you will still have people in the fast pass line with you but not nearly the same as lining up without one). Look on your fast pass ticket for the next time you are able to get a fast pass and make sure to utilize that!!Well worth the trip there! We stayed at the Hilton which was very close to it and we caught the monorail there and back. Such an incredible place! Cannot miss this one!"
967,5,17-Oct,Indonesia,Childhood Reloaded,"We have visited many Disneyland, but in Tokyo they take it to the next level, we visited on October 2017, so we have the Halloween event. The parade was wonderful, the attraction was superb, and in Japan whether you want it or not, they always queue,  and no tricks bypassing the queue allowed. [in Hongkong there's many times it happens]There're souvenir shop along the road, and when the fireworks ended, there were shopping frenzy, every one, I mean every one literally fill the shops, and they spend 10.000 yen minimum."
968,5,17-Oct,Australia,Amazing ,"Yeah Disneyland was fantastic ! Even with rain , it didn‚Äôt stop us from having a great time and enjoying the rides ! what a magical place :)"
969,5,17-Oct,N/A,Magical for all,"Loved this Disneyland very big and many restaurants the queue goes fast and shuttle busses very often from Kasai station , it must be a day trip , plan to spend whole day there Will highly recommend it ManalOman"
970,4,17-Oct,Japan,Another visit,Several attractions were closed for refurbishment. Was very busy this time but we really enjoyed Stat Tours which had a reasonable waiting time
971,5,17-Apr,Australia,Magical,"We had a fabulous day at Tokyo Disneyland.  This place just oozes happiness.  Adults and children alike will absolutely love it here.  The queues to get in weren‚Äôt as bad as we‚Äôve experienced in California and the security checks weren‚Äôt as time consuming.  All the rides were great; with wait times of varying length.  Make sure you organise your day so you can see all the attractions and parades and make wise use of fast passes.  We didn‚Äôt think much of the food on offer at Tokyo Disneyland....there weren‚Äôt enough food stalls selling lunch items, but quite a few popcorn stalls.  You can refill your novelty bucket with popcorn all day if you want, but you might be waiting in line longer for popcorn than you would for a ride!  We ended up booking a restaurant for lunch/dinner at a ridiculous time of 3.30pm but that was the only time available.  I‚Äôd advise that if you are wanting to eat something more than popcorn all day, I‚Äôd make time to book a restaurant earlier in your day.  The meal we did have in the restaurant was terrific and worth waiting for."
972,5,17-Oct,United States,Awesome,"Luckily we visited in October when everyone is allowed to come in a Disney-themed costume. So many people were dressed up (the best was a mother & father dressed as Burt & Mary Poppins on Jolly Holiday - with their two small children dressed as penguins.) The Japanese love Disney and show it in their attention to detail. Most of the rides are very similar to their American counterparts (Pooh's Honey Hunt is quite different and the best Pooh ride I have ever been on.) The parades are over the top and include a lot of the older Disney characters (one float was dedicated to the Aristocats.) Their Electric Light Parade is so much better than the one that is now in California (coming from Florida); it is almost worth the price of a plane ticket just for that. People are allowed to stakeout a spot and to sit during the parades, so lining up in the back is much better and I was (finally) able to see the entire parade.  I found the fireworks to be rather lame, however. The Magic Kingdom's are much bigger and fantastic. "
973,5,17-Oct,Australia,It was a really fun day,"I'm not sure why people are complaining about the crowds and long waits? It's Disney for heaven's sake, of course, it's going to be crowded. We are a family of 3 and we enjoyed our day thoroughly. Yes it was crowded, yes there were queues but it's pretty much what we expected. Rides were about a 20-minute wait, food wasn't long at all, maybe 5 minutes. Except for the turkey leg queue. That was a line that went on for about 100 meters and they only sell turkey leg. We waited for 20 minutes and enjoyed our turkey!The parades were very entertaining so make sure you see some.All in all a very fun day."
974,5,17-Oct,Australia,Fun even in the rain,"We only had one day in the park so we ventured out even though it was raining. Disney just have it all under control.... and even in the pouring rain the park is buzzing and busy. The parades still go ahead and cast members are still smiling as the entertain the guests.  The rides out in the elements were not all running and rides that were indoors had reasonable wait times as crowd numbers are obviously down.We watched a parade, did a few rides, ate great burgers (Mickey sandwiches) and did some shopping.  Sadly the rain didn‚Äôt let up and the cold got the better of us after about 3 hours of fun at the park... we headed back to our hotel for showers and to dry off. A great day, just cut short! "
975,5,16-Nov,N/A,The MUST!!,"After the 1st day at Disney Sea, my 2nd day was spent at Disney Land. Feeling younger than the first day. Everything we're so lovely and brought back the feeling of childhood. Unluckily, it was too windy that night, therefore the parade was cancelled. It might be the sign that I must find a chance to go back again :) PS. Prepare a lot of money, because there are many lovely item for you to spend. :)"
976,4,17-Oct,Malaysia,Family overseas trip,Kids paradise lots of fun n activities for kids n adults to enjoy.  Within 1 day there were 3 events for Halloween October month. 1) Happy times event at 1pm2) Halloween at 4.30pm3) evening parade + fireworks after 8pm.  It covers 115 acres but we only visited a portion of the famous areas. Wl take at 3 to 4 days to actually visit the whole area.
977,4,17-Oct,United States,Charming and cute attraction in Disneyland,"It was a very nice theme park with family. If you are adult, the attractions are kind of boring, but they are so fantastic for kids. They are so charming, cute and sweet."
978,5,16-Dec,Singapore,Tokyo Disneyland - It Never Fails,"We love Tokyo Disneyland. We had a 3-day pass this time round. But between Disneyland and DisneySea, if given a choice, I would choose DisneySea since there are more similar Disneyland around.Rides, fireworks, parade etc. Always enjoyable. Manageable queue lines."
979,5,17-Oct,Singapore,The happiest place ever.,"Tokyo Disneyland is always fun on every visit. Tips would be to buy your tickets in advance (e.g. Disney hotels, online, or Disney store at Shibuya sells tics too). Go early at opening 8am to get on the best rides (e.g. space mountain, splash mountain, big thunder mountain) and also make sure you get your fast passes once you reach. There are also fast passes and long queues for certain kids rides like winnie the pooh. Go back for the night shows, the night electric lights parade starts at 730pm, fireworks 830pm and night show 850pm. It is always packed but you should be able to get a spot where it is all viewable. You are allowed to leave the park and go back later in case you need to go back to the hotel for a rest. Maihama is only about 20mins from Tokyo station though the walk within Tokyo station to get to the line is pretty far. So about 30mins travel time."
980,5,17-Oct,Singapore,Now I know why magic happens in Disneyland,"Reach there about 9:30am thanks to the shuttle bus provide by my hotel. Absolutely two thumbs up. The place is pretty neat and nice, they are so thoughtful that they even have a budget dining table on their guide map. The reason why you have to spend a day there is mostly due to the ride queues. I spent like 30 to 40 minutes waiting time per ride. Therefore I suggest to do a park exploration before joining the queue for any ride so at least you are able to hop onto the rides that interest you should you do not have enough time. In addition, those souvenirs store are absolutely magical. Once you enter into a store, you will come out with a few bags and the magical store will make your wallet thinner and credit card fly. Remember to eat more POPCORNS LOL. DON'T FORGET THE PARADE TOO!!! "
981,5,17-Oct,Australia,"Rides, Spectacle and Pageantry ","Can be difficult to get to with traffic but don't be put off. This venue has spared no expense in representing the Disney brand. It embodies a spirit of excellence in customer service and experience which one hopes to see. The rides are fabulous but in some ways, to the Western eye, the crowd watching is just as special as cosplay blends with Disney dress up. I'll bet no other nation gets into the spirit of Disney like the Japanese. As a tip rainy days are good for smaller crowds and shorter queues."
982,5,17-Oct,United States,Fun day,"Had a fun day at Tokyo Disneyland. It reminds me a lot of the Magic Kingdom park in Florida, but with a slightly modified layout and a few unique rides such as Monsters Inc Hide and Go Seek and Pooh's Honey Hunt. Cast was super helpful even though we didn't speak Japanese and we really enjoyed how many of the guests were dressed up for a day at the parks."
983,4,17-Oct,United States,It's Disneyland ,"Similar to the US but the staff are much more pleasant and the grounds much more cleaner.  They have different treats as compared to the US, but overall the same. I actually feel like the rides are shorter than in the US. "
984,5,17-Sep,Australia,AMAZING!,"We stayed overnight at Tokyo Disney hotel, and spent one day at Tokyo Disneyland and the next day at Disney Sea. They were all amazing. Our favourite ride anywhere was at Tokyo Disneyland, which was space mountain. Its probably the best ride i've ever been on. Make sure to use the fast passes - we used ours on space mountain straight away, and we were really glad we did! The whole day was a great experience, I will absolutely go back! Also - if you're in two minds about whether to stay at the hotel, do it, you can get in 15 mins early to the park, which means you are at an advantage for the fast passes all day long, it makes the day much better."
985,4,16-Dec,N/A,Very fun and interesting experience day,"This area is very wide and many interesting games which our children are very excited to participate in and they are happy to see the girls /boys are transformed into disneyland characters in the cartoon film.With many areas to relax, eat and drinks, will be able to play and enjoy some famous Japanese food. It is worth experiencing full day here."
986,5,17-Apr,Japan,Be Prepared to Wait,"We love Disneyland! We lived in CA for many years, and we had season passes. The park was crowded during times in California, but there were times when it wasn't crowded. It's always crowded in Tokyo. ALWAYS. We've been twice, and both times it was just so many people. Even the least complicated and mundane activities seemed arduous."
987,5,17-Oct,N/A,Your legacy continues Walt Disney,"None of this would be possible without the vision of Walt. A vision where everyone can have fun. It was a public holiday when we went, so it was insanely busy. But we managed to go for the popular rides, and had no problems getting our fast pass. The line for the food was so long, it was like waiting for a ride. We really didn't bother with the shows as they were in Japanese. And to top it off at the end of the day, stay back for the electric show followed by the laser and fireworks. Although it was packed, we enjoyed every second of it.Walt Disney legacy lives on in us."
988,1,17-Oct,Japan,Caters to high paying Fastpass visitors,"What a headache!  I cannot believe how Tokyo Disneyland (and Sea) operate!  Basically this company caters to high paying fastpass clients only!  ""Regular"" visitors (aka Standby visitors) wait in line for hours only being let in by a ratio of 1:3, while ""Fast Track"" elites just walk in.  My experience for Space Mountain And Tower of Terror was that they would let in 6 standbys for every 28 fast trackers.  Thus moving at a torturous snail pace.  What a rip off, lost total respect for this company.  Never going back."
989,5,17-Oct,Japan,Wonderful! Busy! Fun!,We visited on a Thursday before a long weekend and managed to get on 8 rides while stopping often for food and snacks in about 10 hrs. The park was busy but not manic. We went straight to Pooh's Hunny Hunt when the park opened and only waited about 20 mins to ride it as opposed to 2 hrs during peak times. I would recommend getting a Fast pass as soon as you arrive as the times fill up very quickly. My favourite ride was Splash Mountain! We didn't have a Fast Pass for that but only waited an hour so it wasn't bad at all. My least favourite ride was Peter Pan's Flight; it was very short and the track was jerky.The food at Disney is great. I tried the milk chocolate popcorn which was absolutely delicious. Curry popcorn was OK. I loved the Halloween special churro which was maple pumpkin flavour and also enjoyed the new Star Wars mochi! We ate lunch at Tomorrowland Terrace which was reasonably priced and filling.I think Tokyo Disneyland is unique for the guests that dress up in fantastic themed costumes and groups of friends and families who coordinate their outfits. It was really cute to see.Make sure you wear comfortable shoes and clothes as there is a lot of walking!
990,1,17-Oct,N/A,Burn it down!!,"This was a horrendous experience that left 3 of us crying. We arrived when gates opened and missed out on FastPasses. The queues for the big rides were between 2.5 and 4 hours long. The crowds were unbelievable with the park at capacity. We could barely move. There were queues for the queues. Haha. The queues for food and drink were minimum 1 hour. Including water. There are no vending machines or other quick way to grab a water, in the end we barged through an exit to get to a water cooler we spotted as one of us was feeling so faint. (We realise now there were a couple of drinking water fountains in the park but would never have spotted them through the crowds). I generally enjoy theme parks, but this was horrendous. We basically shuffled around with 80 thousand other people, consoled crying teenagers when it became clear they weren't going to get on any rides, queued up for 30mins for popcorn, waited an hour for a short canoe ride, missed the parades by being stuck in queues. You get the drift. We also barely saw any disney characters roaming. There were a couple just inside the gates, but again, queuing for an eternity for a photo was horrible. I would never recommend this place. Ever. "
991,3,17-Oct,Norway,Arm yourself with Fastpass,"Seriously, do not go without a Fastpass if you plan on doing more than 1-2 rides in one day. Not only that, some rides they simply close to general population (that is, without Fastpass), so even if you want to wait 2 hours in the line, you can not. Apart from that, its a fun park, with pro's and con's in comparision to elsewhere in the world. But then again, you are in Tokyo and not Paris, and comparing those is pointless. Facilities are OK, even with a proper crowd in the afternoon there was no major cues for food counters and restrooms. I recommend to visit, lots of fun for smaller and bigger kids."
992,5,17-Sep,N/A,Fun for all ages,"Disneyland is an entertainment paradise for all ages. Whilst lines can be long, utilising the FastPass option and being flexible on your route around the various sections you will have no problems getting on the rides you want. Unfortunately a number of key rides were closed for construction and maintenance when we were there, but it was still a great day out! Entertainment central with parades, shops and rides...there is so much to take in. "
993,4,17-Oct,Australia,Great fun for all ,"Disneyland Tokyo is great. My kids (4 and 7) loved it, particularly the night time light parade.  It gets busy especially weekends and Monday and we noticed (while we were there) it was noticeably busier than Disneysea. Food was average. Use the Fastpass - it took us a day to get the hang of it.  Grab one (if he queue isn't longer than going on the ride itself - which sometimes you see). Then when grab the NEXT as soon as the time allows (it's printed on your Fastpass) then go on the ride for the first Fastpass.  Splitting up is easier to get one adult to grab the Fastpass.   "
994,4,17-Sep,Australia,A bit of fun.,"Having visited Anaheim Disneyland many times over the years since the early '80s, I decided to weaken and take in Tokyo Disneyland. Strange mix of Japanese and English language used. I was familiar with original rides so language barrier no real problem. Amazing number of locals arrived dressed up in theme outfits. Unfortunately a number of attractions were closed or under construction/renovation. Was still worth a bit of a look. Fun time but I've satisfied my curiosity now."
995,3,17-Feb,N/A,Little disappointed,If you do not know how fastpass works... be prepared to spend time waiting in the lines!I was there with two children on holidays for the first time. I was a little disappointed. Enclosed food areas are small (especially in the winter).  Food service is poor.
996,5,17-Oct,Philippines,An Asian version of the happiest place on earth,"Those who are familiar with the original Disneyland park will feel very much at home here. All of the best loved attractions can be found (in Japanese, of course), and some of the issues with the original park have been corrected. For example, the thoroughfares are much wider; the space in front of the castle is HUGE; there are more spokes leading from the center of the park; and the crowd capacity is better at most attractions. There are also some unique gems found nowhere else such as the delightful Pooh's Hunny Hunt."
997,4,17-Sep,United States,Things to be aware of while visiting Tokyo Disney,"Tickets are less expensive then the American park, 3 day tic was $170 (BUT you must spend one full day in Disneyland/one full day in DisneySea and the 3rd day the ticket becomes a park hopper.Fastpass is the paper system used in CA, be sure to make use especially on popular rides (and yes the Pooh Honey Pot is worth it) Don't expect folks to leave as they do in America when it rains..nope..these folks put on ponchos (super sturdy and $9) and stay put.Don't expect to understand the words spoken on any of the rides. Ask for a translation sheet that tells you the story of the ride. Some rides have actual translators that you can read along with the ride but then you would miss the amazing visuals.The park itself, the rides, parades are amazing in scope and detail.Don't expect to find park merchandise or ride tie-ins at the gift shops..expect to find tons and tons and tons of Duffy Bear everywhere.Don't expect the monorail to be free UNLESS you stay at one of the three Disney hotels. If you stay at any others (even those on Disney property or good neighbors) you have to buy a ticket but can purchase a multiple day one.Food venues all seem to offer really cool souvenir plates and cups--definitely worth the money and geared toward that particular restaurant. Lots of strange flavored popcorn and tons of different buckets to purchase ($25) but remember they are huge and difficult to pack so bring extra suitcases or check in advance as to which ones you really want."
998,4,17-Oct,United States,One of the Top Disney Parks,"A great Disney park that is comparable and slightly edges out Disney World in Orlando and exceeds Disneyland in California. There are several rides that surpass their U.S. counterparts at Tokyo Disney. Not the least of which is Pooh's Honey Hunt. What is a so-so ride in the U.S. is a highlight and a ""must-see"" at Tokyo. I know what you're thinking - and we didn't believe it either! - but there is a reason for the 1-2 hour wait for this ride!Splash Mountain is another improved upon ride at Tokyo Disneyland. More drops, better theming, and a longer ride, Splash Mountain in Tokyo was a welcome surprise!Finally, Tokyo took a tired Space Mountain ride at DisneyWorld and made it so much better. For starters, double the riders with a 2 by 2 by 2 car format helps move things along. Also, a longer ride with better special effects breathes fresh air into this ""tired"" U.S. ride.Most of the other attractions are pretty similar to the U.S. Disney Parks; however, I will say the Tokyo parades are fantastic and seem to occur every couple of hours. The parade routes are long and the energy is sky-high.Overall, Tokyo Disneyland is a world-class Disney park that shouldn't be missed if you're in the area."
999,5,16-Nov,Malaysia,Second Visit,"This is our second visit to Disneyland Tokyo, this time with new family member addition ..my son.I been to all Disneyland in the world except Disneyworld in Orlando, but Tokyo Disneyland got the best magic vibe among all of them, that is why I decided to re-visit with my family again.This time with my daughter we had enjoy more ride than when she visited here first time, we had some really enjoyable time  here  father-daughterOne of the Tokyo magical moment is their Parade, a MUST see for all visitor as Tokyo Disneyland Parade is really magical, entertaining , far more enjoyable than other Disneyland which I had visited.Regard the ticket , unless there some discount online, or else dont even bother to buy online ticket, get them from Disney Store the day before or even earlier.. If that is not desirable just get them from ticket booth.But there are days where the park is full, they will not sell you one at the ticket booth. All disney ticket is dated, even if you buy multiple day ticket, you need to specific days & date you going to Disneysea or Disneyland prior So if you at Disney Store to get tickets for tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, then you will have a guarantee entrance to avoid disappointmentBack to disney, well.. don't worry about food, Disney Tokyo has a great range of food available, especially the turkey leg.. that is really delicious. Beside restaurant, a handful of food counter and stall is well located across the park. Do not miss out their souvenir shop, they got huge selection of merchandise where you hardly will find in other Disney store. We stay will the end of park operation hour after enjoying the spectacular firework show and magical projection show. Both my kids enjoy the show alot, especially the night parade, is really brilliant light show.I love Disneyland Tokyo, absolutely recommend for everyone to visit here. Come and experience yourself !"
1000,5,17-Jun,United States,Tokyo Disneyland,"Such a lovely place for children. We have young children and teenage, and Disneyland is suitable both of these ages. We spent 2 days in Tokyo disneyland and that‚Äôs one of our best leisure times ever. There is one thing that we had pity so much was at that night, the fire work did not work without clearly reason (although it was not rain)."
1001,5,17-Oct,N/A,"Besides d disney world, my fav disneyland","I‚Äôd been to tokyo disneyland for eight times and everytime i come, its still as perfect as everAbsolutely in love with the disneysea MUST SEEBuy a three days pass if u want to get the best pics and get on all d rides in both the parksRemember that there are certain popcorn carts who sell the soecial editions of popcorn buckets if u r a collector like me hahahahaGood food everywhereLove the crepes and the desserts they sellRemember to queue politely as japanese are very disciplined peopleIf u have kids, get a disney strollerRegister upon entry"
1002,1,17-Sep,Australia,Online Tickets to Disneyland and DisneySea in Tokyo,"There is an Online Tickets on Tokyo Disney Resort website. Tried to book the theme park tickets to save time at the entrance. But they don't accept any foreign credit cards. We tried all our Visa, Master and AMEX. None of them works. It keeps telling you to verify. We called our bank and nothing wrong with the cards as they were accepted by direct hotel bookings in Japan. So don't bother to purchase Online. Just go direct to the gate. The queue was only 5 min wait on The day we visited."
1003,3,17-Sep,N/A,Too crowded big lines Very odd,I have been to Disneyland in Anaheim and love it We went to this one but it feels odds everything is the same but it's in Japanese I know I was in Japan but it was like owning a Mustang but with a Toyota engine what the ! It is very odd very odd plus the Japanese love their fake entertainment so you have to fight your way through them . Ride waits are up to 120 minutes !!!! for a three minute ride again what the ! There is the traditional turkey thigh you can buy . it's hilarious watching Japanese folk chewing on a turkey thigh :) But what ever you do don't buy the hot dog it's so different to our hot dogs . Basically very happy we left
1004,3,17-Oct,Australia,An a-okay place to be :) ,"Disneyland is great for young children and young teens under the age of 16 :) the rides were very G - PG rated and it's more of a park where you explore the makings of Walt Disney,  Disney movies and characters.  We went at the beginning of Autumn and it was actually so hot!  The prices of food inside the park were decent and affordable. The curry sold at the hungry bear restaurant is really nice so this place is nice to eat at in the park for an early dinner.  There were a couple thrilling rides such as Space Mountain, Splash Mountain and the pirates of the Caribbean ride :) the views are incredible on each ride! It's like you're actually in another world! Oh and the waiting times for each ride were so much faster than other parks! The waiting times at Disneyland were pretty fast moving and the most that you would ever have to wait for a ride would be 1 hour or just over.  The lines continuously move and the wait is worth it because whatever ride you go on in the end has amazing views I'm sure :) "
1005,5,17-Apr,Australia,Love disneyland!,"I am an avid disney fan so this was a must see during my stay in japan. We did this disney park after having done the disney park in America. Obviously it is smaller, and most of the rides are in japanese. However, this did not bother us we had done the rides in the American disney. It still has the classics such as peter pan, snow white, madhatter teacups, and small world attraction. The longest we waited was 30 minutes for a ride. There where two parades during the day and light the night one at night time which was awesome. We left the park for dinner, as across the park there is a food court which was well priced. Inside the castle is a cinderella ballroom which is beautiful, and there are many beautiful statues around the park. There are fireworks and a light show on the castle at night too. The park is easy to get too via train, the attendants at the train station where very helpful when we asked for the disneyland stop. Highly recommend this park!"
1006,5,17-Jun,Singapore,Tokyo Disneyland is Great with various points explained,"Summary : Tokyo Disneyland is Great , so no doubt about it , you must definitely visit It is difficult to explain everything in this small review but I would try to summarize below, pls give THUMBS UP on it if it helps ... 1. Do your research first before visiting 2. Buy cheap tickets ahead (no discount at the park) and check weather forecast 3. Reach early ( 7 - 8 am ), and better to stay in nearby hotels ( there are many )4. Each Parks must be visited for 2 days to enjoy completely 5. Disney SEA is slightly better than Disneyland ( at least I felt that )6. June is a great time to visit, we went in June and it was SUNNY & yet GREAT weather7. No point buying Mickey Glass, T-Shirts on high price on the Park, you can buy those at cheap price ahead of your visit 8. DEFINITELY try to make use of FASTPASS as much as possible, without that you will be in long queue Let me know if this helps, let me know if you have any questions and pls give THUMBS UP on it if you like it. Thanks C Saha"
1007,5,17-Feb,India,Amazing fun for the whole family here!,"It was really cold when we went in late Autumn, but light on crowds so the longest wait time was less than one hour. Hubby and I and the kids all had an awesome time here and stayed for the night lights parade. Definitely worth the wait - even the Disney princess dresses were lit up!Most of the attractions were open and you can take a ticket and come back later on selected rides to save wait time.We were disappointed not to see the Fairytale castle open, but everything else was available. Space Mtn, Pooh Bear rides and the classic tea-cup and It's a Small Wall rides were good. Not as expensive as we'd expected either."
1008,3,17-Oct,Australia,Disney Fun,"We went on a Saturday (so very busy) and a little overwhelming compared to our trip to Universal in Osaka. This was a bucket list item for me and whilst I‚Äôm glad I went, it did not quite live up to expectations. It is more geared towards small children, which is expected, but it didn‚Äôt seem to have the ‚Äòmagic‚Äô I imagined it would. Disney Resort looks more magical than the park itself! Good rides and lots of eateries and street food. Easy access from the train station is great. "
1009,3,16-Nov,N/A,Great rides and facilities,Well its for children to enjoy...better go in disney sea if you were for adventure...fireworks were not that amazing unlike im disneyland hk.
1010,5,17-Sep,Australia,A great day out for the family,"We spent a day at Disneyland with two couples, two 5 year olds, a 3 year old and 10 month old. I think that was enough time to see what we wanted to.There are rides and activities for all ages. To get the most out of the rides, you need to be over 102cm. Make sure you get there at least half an hour before opening time and pre- purchase tickets online. Make sure you know which rides are a must and go directly to them when the park opens. Otherwise you may miss out or find yourself in a queue of over an hour.They have a fast pass system that I would read up on before you go as it seems to change regularly (based on what people who had been before have told me). There was plenty of food on offer with some particularly interesting popcorn flavours including curry!The nighttime parade was fantastic and a must see. The floats were incredible!For people with young kids, you can hire a stroller for 100 Yen (about $11 Australian). I would recommend you do as there is a lot of walking to be done.Definitely a great place for people of all ages. "
1011,5,17-Feb,Philippines,Disneyland,2nd Disneyland we have visited. So much bigger than Hong Kong's disneyland. Some of the attractions are almost the same with a twist Food here are expensive we were over budget as early as 5pmUse the fast pass to your advantage. Make sure to use it on your favorite rides only.
1012,5,17-Sep,United Kingdom,Magical Place,"This was our last Disney we needed to visit worldwide and well we saved the best for last.Yet another magical place, where at any age you feel like the child inside you again comes alive.This Disney is so well organised, nothing feels stressed or rushed, people queue in an orderly fashion and there is no pushing or screaming kids anywhere.We were lucky enough to attend at the time of year when public are allowed to dress up as characters and well this just made the whole day even more magical. Some were dressed even better than the real characters.The parades were the best we have ever seen and again so well organised. Everyone is made to take a spot, but no one can stand up in front of someone, you can't block people's views, you can't overcrowd an area, it was just magical and the organisation made the whole event better.Now there were some queues and some were an hour long, and this was on what was one of the quietest days of the year, but get there early run round like a mad man and do what you want to do and then enjoy the rest of the day at your leisure. Fabulous fabulous experience not be missed even if it's your first Disney experience. "
1013,5,17-Aug,United Arab Emirates,Happy Happy Happy Land,"Yes It is crowded but what can you do its Disney. Just try to avoid holidays, like I did. But every thing about Disney  land and Sea are fantastic, from polite & professional stuff, variety of restaurants, rides, showsÿå parade...etc, I dont know where to start, just fun fun every where.Even after I cam back they still make me happy,  see I lost my favourite cap when I was in Disney land, after two weeks since I cam back I got call today that I have package from Japan !!!! ?????  They send my cap to my address in Dubai just like that .... Honestly I didn't expect that.  As some one told me before nothing get lost in Japan I love you JapanSUGOI"
1014,5,16-Nov,Singapore,Disneyland = Dreamland for everyone,"Its everyone's dream to visit Disneyland.  I went two years ago during winter.  Be prepared with lots of warm clothings, drinks and snacks.  Food is extremely limited and expensive.  Long queue for rides that are popular.  Try to get Fasttrack or Express coupons when they make announcements over the PA System so that you do not have to wait long for your turn to take the rides.  Most popular place among tourists are the souvenir shops.  Most popular items to get are the Disney characters for the popcorn holders.  Different areas sell different Disney characters.  Check it out with their Information Centre or the map."
1015,5,17-Aug,Australia,Fairytale sensation. ,"I had long dreamed of raking my family to Disneyland and it didn't disappoint. Easy to get to and a fair price for entry.All the classic rides; space mountain,  the teacups etc.Unlike every theme park in the west, this one provides good foods at fair prices...family of 4 fed, lunch, dinner and snacks for under ¬•10000. We will be going back and will explore Disney sea too next time."
1016,3,17-Sep,United Kingdom,A good day out.,"I have been to Euro Disney and this is somewhat smaller. For me the disappointment was that two big rides, Thunder Mountain which I was looking forward to and a Small, small world which I wanted to go on for nostalgic reasons, were both closed for refurbishment. This wasn't mentioned on the website and not even when you enter the park. It rained for a lot of the day, although Disney can't be held responsible for the weather they didn't deal with it very well, cancelling a parade and a show because of it...having come to Tokyo many times over the years I know it rains! Overall though, we had an enjoyable day.  The food and drink was not overpriced as it can be in theme parks and they did sell umbrellas üåÇ at a reasonable price!"
1017,5,17-Jun,United States,Tokyo Disneyland,"Awesome time, purchased a package deal through ITT travel in Okinawa.  Spent one day at Tokoyo Disney with 7 and 10 year olds.  No problems getting on rides with either of them.  Good english speaking staff and ride wait times were not outrageous as expected.  Max ride wait was 20 mins for the newer attractions.  Popcorn of different varieties is for sale throughout the park, each stall sells a specific popcorn bucket for $25.  Pick the one you want before you go and buy that first.  Good snack for kids while trying to choose between restaurants.  Bucket refills are only $5 or 500 yen.  Downside was that there was not enough drink vendors and water is a hot commodity.  I suggest loading the backpack with enough water bottles for everyone in the family to have one and refilling them at the drinking fountains.  The restaurants only sell one type of food which is bad with two picky eaters.  We never did decide what we wanted to eat so we snacked the whole first day. Plan meals ahead using the map on the Disney website.  The shops were priced as expected of Disney but you don't choose Disney as a vacation without planning to drop some money.  Overall it was a wonderful trip, I can't wait to go back."
1018,5,17-Sep,United Kingdom,Loved the parades,"Had a wonderful day here in mid September. We deliberately chose a midweek day to come to avoid weekend crowds and we weren't disappointed.We arrived 45 mins before the gates opened and we managed to get on everything we wanted to do in a day using fastpasses. We saw all three of the parades and the show in Tomorrowland too. For any Disney fan this place is a must, the merchandise alone makes it worth to visit. There is something unique in almost half the shops so if you love souvenir shopping then this is ideal, but do it early, there will be frenzied biscuit buying at the end of the day. I've noted a few times in reviews that people complain about the lack of English and difficulty in communicating. However I found that we had no problems at all, there are pictures to point at and you/cast members usually get the gist of the conversation. Just be polite, the cast will do everything they can to help you and when they can't they will go and get someone who can speak English.Great park with the most wonderful entertainment of any Disney park anywhere. "
1019,5,17-Sep,New Zealand,Magic! ,Such a magical place. Tip: most common attractions are splash mountain and the buzz lightyear one. Do those first or get fast passes as by the time we realised the lines were a 100 minute wait or had to come back at 930 with your fast past. After being on our feet all day neither was a great option! Gutted we missed those two but everything we did was great! Disney sea is better so I'm glad we did Disneyland first :) 
1020,5,17-Sep,Singapore,2 days in Disneyland!,"Amazing time there! The cosplayers made the place more interesting, probably the only Disneyland in the world where you can see so many visitors dressing up like Disney characters."
1021,5,17-Jan,Australia,It is really a magic place,"The happy feeling is catching even as an adult. This place is amazing and if you have never been to disney and worry that your too old to enjoy it, please don't, you will have the best day. This place is massive! and even in winter we found that the wait time was around 30min to an hour, so the fast passes can be worth it. There are many different sections to the park each with there own theme, music and foods!.The light shows at the end are beautiful and worth staying for. The food within the park is average."
1022,4,17-Aug,Australia,Great day out,"If you haven't been to Disneyland you must go. The place is amazing, beautifully designed and extremely well laid out. The park is clean the staff are friendly and helpful and all of the attractions are great fun. It's great value and you can easily spend the entire day as there is so much to see and do. The only downside for me was the length of the queues, when we visited they were up to 2 hours by the end of the day. You can get a fast pass for some rides every two hours so get there early to make the most of this system. "
1023,4,17-Jul,Indonesia,Finally visited Tokyo Disney,"Tokyo Disneyland in my honest opinion is a bit old..you can see it in the looks of some of the rides and unfortunately a few of the rides were also closed for renovation at the time of my visit, not to mention the scorching hot summer weather and oh so crowded visitors everywhere with long queues in almost every ride, together with unusual (at least for me) lottery system to get a ticket for the musical show. It all made my visit somehow less impressive than what I had previously expected. But after all it is still Disneyland, and you can't help feeling happy and amazed going there. Star Wars 4d ride there was great and they did great job with the parades (I watched all 3 parades of the day:Tanabata parade, mid-Day Parade, Night Lights Parade).They have a few restaurants with different themes, as well as snacks stall with yummy popcorn and ice cream too..Oh and the Cinderella grand castle is indeed majestic and magnificent, the way it was lit up at night time along with projection fireworks show is also something you should not miss!All in all still a great day out at Disneyland Tokyo, but for more sophisticated rides, less tiring walk around the theme park, shorter queue time for each rides, and easy access to the musical shows, you might as well consider going to Hongkong Disneyland."
1024,5,17-Jan,Poland,best day EVER,"it doesn't matter if you are young, a teenager, mum or dad or even in the autumn of life. Everyone will find something interesting, funny, exiting there.Experience of a lifetime. I've been there more times that i am willing to admit and i would go there even tomorrow if it would be possible.I will give you all one tip i picked up - be there as early as possible. stand in line (if you are not staying in Disney Resort), be ready to buy your ticket and then...run :) before you even go there research attractions you want to visit. For some of them you can take fast tract tickets, for some you need to take part in lottery to get in. Internet is your friend in this case. Either way just go there and enjoy your time - it will be unforgettable experience!"
1025,4,17-Aug,Kuwait,Wonderful  day,"I love Theme park and I went to this park for my daughter tammy to see Micky mouse and others.The great thing about Disney tokyo no long waiting to take photo, we wait 40 mins for Micky,15 mins for Donald,20 mins, for Mini,10 mins for Daisy and it easy to take photo with pluto and Gofey.This park like Magic kingdom park.we enjoyed in the games like Jungle cruise,Pinocchio's Daring Journey and splash with take more than 1 hr waiting.It is worth visit and I will come back I visit Tokyo"
1026,3,16-Nov,Singapore,Nice place to enjoy...,"Disneyland Tokyo is a nice place for family and friend to enjoy,but the price too expensive  it would better if have discount for family size."
1027,1,17-Sep,N/A,Disappointing,"The fast pass thing is a mess. I went to Disneyland on weekday, but the ""standby"" queues didn't forward a step for several minutes. "
1028,5,17-Sep,Australia,One of the best disney parks i have been too....,"Not much merchandise but still a great day out, you will need to get a fast pass on splash mountain but everything else was 10 to 15 min wait....."
1029,5,17-Sep,United States,Disney Day ,"I love Disneyland.  I love how everything in this park is themed to top, namely the food and its packaging and presentation .  The hamburgers have Mickey buns, pizza is Mickey shaped, being in close proximity to Halloween, items were featured had a fall appeal. Plus items stayed consistent to area you were in at the park.  So cool to see versus the generic Disney stuff back in the U.S."
1030,5,17-Sep,Japan,Familia ,"Very nice place.more more fun and activities.good for adults and kids.lots of rides and stores for souvenirs,cloths for kids and adults.delicious foods anywhere."
1031,5,17-Sep,Australia,Best day!,"Tokyo Disneyland was so much fun! Tips: check the crowd prediction websites and go on a weekday and choose a day with low crowds (this is probably what helped us to get on so many rides so quickly by choosing a day with low predicted crowds); buy a ticket in advance (saves you time in lines if you already have your ticket); use the fastpass system for Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, Pooh's Honey Hunt & Buzz Lightyear; watch the Happiness Parade it's sensational; try the different flavoured popcorns for sale throughout the park; if you're going to eat dinner at the Queen's Banquet Hall go early (we went in at about 5:30pm) to try miss the mega queue. The only disappointing thing from the whole day was that the night-time electrical parade was cancelled due to bad weather (damn rain), otherwise Tokyo Disneyland is a magical place and heaps of fun :-)"
1032,5,17-Sep,China,Fun for all ages,The atmosphere is always so magical which makes everyone feel excited and young. Wednesday is a good day to visit as less crowd. The beautiful story time after the fireworks is beautiful. The Japanese food at Hokusai is good and quite reasonably priced. The curry rice is also a good choice for lunch. 
1033,4,17-Apr,Australia,DISNEY!!!!,"I went when it was 10degrees and pouring with rain but it was still one of my best days in Japan! Very easy to get to from Tokyo ( just follow the Mickey ears on the subway line). It's everything you would expect from Disney- bright, happy and slightly over-priced. I went only to get my hands on a pair of Mickey Mouse Ears so I left a very happy person :) Rides have both single and multi rider lines for all rides so if you are a solo traveller chances are you are going to get through the rides faster"
1034,3,17-Aug,Australia,Long lines and hot humid weather in late summer,"Out of Tokyo, Orlando, L.A and Paris, Tokyo Disney was probably my least favorite, or on par with Paris. It get very hot and humid in late summer so expect to be dripping with sweat from head to toe within 5 mins. There is limited airconditioned rooms which can make the trip extra exhausting. Make sure to have a fastpass and rides app to try to skip the 300min lines as they can really exhaust and damage a trip. The food is all delicious and the drinks are great too but be prepared to wait about half an hour to make your order as the ques are long everywhere. I'm not sure if this Disney has a maximum capacity as it seemed that there were always people coming in.  "
1035,4,17-Aug,United Kingdom,Second choice for Disney in Tokyo,"This park is not as good as Disney Sea, our toddler could barely go on any of these rides although the indoor play area was amazing. Our bigger kids enjoyed the tower of terror and the Buzz Lightyear ride and we all enjoyed watching the parade. There was a small range of characters that came out for photo ops but it was difficult to get a photo with them as there was no queuing and plenty of pushing in. The best ride for our toddler was the Winnie the Pooh ride. "
1036,5,17-Sep,N/A,Best day ever! ,We went to Disneyland on Friday and it was magical we arrived at 9:00am and left at 11:00pm..You have to go on the Pooh ride it is exclusive to Disney Tokyo - it can have a big wait time but will be so worth it get a fast pass if you can.   
1037,5,17-Jul,Denmark,Disney party,"For all Disney fans, recommendations. Even with a huge crowd there is great organisation, a lot of activities beside rides or while wait for the raid. It was like a fairy tale. One day is not enough :("
1038,4,17-Aug,Australia,Busy Disney,"Disneyland is great but the crowds are hideous.  Some rides weren't worth the wait with the popular ride wait times up to 2 hours.  I would suggest picking out two or three best rides and where a fast pass is available, go straight to the fast pass ticket counters asap.  We got there a bit later hoping to avoid the early crowds, worked well to get in but the fast pass times were very late, after 8pm or gone altogether.  We stayed until 5, then got a pass out and walked about 10 minutes to Iksbiari shopping centre where we had dinner at TGI Fridays, then returned to Disneyland for night light parade and some more rides.  Ride times were quite a bit less after the parade.  The night parade is by far the best parade due to the spectacular lighting.  Even with the crowds however, this is Disneyland and lots of fun at any time."
1039,4,17-Aug,United States,Super busy (during Matsuri season) and rainy but still beautiful!,"How do I rate this? 4 stars or 5? It almost seems a crime scoring a Disney park less than 5 stars. It's beautiful, it's magical, it's Disney! To be as fair as I can be, here are the facts: 1.) This was not my first Disney experience. 2.) We did not stay on property (too expensive! More on this later) 3.) It was super busy (as mentioned, this was during Summer break so families flooded it 4.) Super rainy I tried to ignore these factors when assigning my rating but I'm sure they impacted my experience and therefore I have to acknowledge that it is entirely possible that if even one of these factors were different, this might have ended up a 5 star review.  Having stated that, four stars is nothing to sneeze at. And having been to Walt Disney World - perhaps nowadays the definitive Disney experience - during a non busy time of year with nearly perfect weather the entire trip, it's fair to say that I am holding Tokyo Disneyland to a VERY high standard. The pros: - Park tickets (""passports"") themselves are relatively inexpensive. We got 2 day passports for I think about $120 each. Not bad, that might be a single day at WDW. - This has all the charm of the Magic Kingdom, it's a true Disney experience with all the parades, shows, fireworks, magic and of course... - The ""attractions"" (I still like to call them ""rides"", even if that makes it sound like a rusty travelling carnival) --> we made sure to hop on all of the exclusive ones that are only available in Tokyo - Pooh's Hunny Hunt was AMAZING, easily my favourite ride. The Roger Rabbit ""Toontown Spin"" ride is also quite cool, and the Monsters Inc Ride and Go Seek was a lot of fun as well. We also got to check out the Japanese version of the Haunted Mansion - it's still my all-time favourite Disney attraction ever.- Even with the huge crowds, getting food was pretty quick. There were lines, but they all seemed to move rapidly. Chalk it up to Japanese efficiency and work ethic, I suppose? - Theming is up to Disney standards. Still the best reason to choose Disney over, say, Universal Studios. The Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall, for instance, in spite of being something of a cafeteria in terms of both service and food, really does make you feel like you're in Wonderland. This alone is worth the wait and money. Cons: - As mentioned above, the resorts are CRAZY expensive. I guess it's because they have fewer hotels and fewer rooms in Tokyo than say, Orlando. Also luxury accommodations in Tokyo seem to be pricey in general, so it could just be a continuation of this trend. Finally, it was during the Summer/Matsuri season, so perhaps you'll have better luck. We had an hour and two train rides (and maybe a can ride if the rain was bad enough or our feet hurt too much) separating us from our hotel at the end of the night. So, like any other Disney park: If you can swing it, stay on property. It was just too pricey for us. This time. - Lines, lines, LINES! And crowds. Okay, so again, we went at probably the worst possible time. Ankle biters everywhere. Also, the nihonjin seem to have this weird thing where they don't course correct for ANYONE, so they would apparently rather collide with you than to do what we in the states do, where both parties shift slightly to make room for the other. So expect to be bumped into a few times and to have to abruptly stop as children run directly in front of you (parenting in Japan is similar to 1980s America - which I think is a good thing, really) but honestly, it's Disney. We expect children. Goes with the territory. Learn from my mistake - don't go during Matsuri season. - NO FASTPASS + (this makes me so sad): I have never had to deal with the oldschool, paper fastpass system before. It was... less than optimal. At least we got to use a fastpass (for Haunted Mansion) but after using FP+ at WDW, this felt like a huge step backwards. - Honestly... that's about it. As I said, I almost rated this a 5 star experience, so you know this was good! It's Disney, it's iconic, it's fantastic, it's fun. Go and have fun!"
1040,4,17-Sep,N/A,Like Florida but even busier,"Great park, as big as Florida with all the favourites. Everything works well and is in order, but boy was it busy. We were there well before opening time, in a Thursday and we couldn't get on most things. Better than Paris, bigger than Hong Kong, very friendly and happy - but get ready for the crowds and long lines. ( major lines for popcorn!!!)"
1041,5,16-Sep,Australia,Does Disney proud,"I have been to Disney theme parks in three other locations around the world (France, Florida and California) and Tokyo Disneyland is easily one of the best locations. The theming is wonderful, the park is well maintained, and the staff are friendly and professional. What a great day out."
1042,5,17-Jun,Australia,Great fun for the entire family,Spent 2 days at Disneyland and 1 day at DisneySea and we had a ball in both parks. Queues for the rides were not overly long and we were able to experience most of them. The place is very well run by a team of dedicated and friendly staff. Looking forward to returning in the future
1043,5,16-Sep,Australia,"Two amazing days, could of stayed 20!","Absolutely loved visiting Disneyland! Magical from the moment you stepped off the train at Maihama station. A Disney lovers dream, but also highly enjoyed by the less fanatic. Can be crowded with waits up to 2 hours for some rides, but utilising the fast pass system helped ease this. My favourite place in the world!"
1044,5,17-Jul,United States,Happiest place on (Japanese) earth!,"The Disney magic works just about anywhere. It's about 45 minutes by subway from the Shinjuku station to the Maihama station. We went on a weekday and the place is packed. If you're short on time, you can get an After 6 pass for 4200 yen (1 Day pass is 7400 yen). The Japanese really get into the Disney spirit. You can see groups of people wearing matching Disney and non-Disney attires, including kimonos. There is a little bit of language barrier. It's weird to hear Mickey and the other characters speaking Japanese, but still entertaining though. I give it a 4.5/5 because the evening fireworks were canceled on the day we went."
1045,4,17-Aug,United Kingdom,Magical experience for all.,"Disneyland Tokyo was lovely and the people who work there really help make the experience better. They are very kind and try their best to accommodate for everyone of different age, size and race. The light show at the end has got to be one of the best parts of the day by far. I would highly recommend staying until the show starts. The only downfall to the experience would be the extremely long queues. My sister, my boyfriend and myself waited in line for Big Thunder Mountain for two hours and it we were all uncomfortable due to the heat. However, if you're well prepared with food and drink then the day should be grand!"
1046,5,17-Jul,Australia,Best day ever!!!,"We recently went to Tokyo Disneyland with our four children aged 14,13,10 and 6. We had the most amazing time. It was not our first visit but I recommend  really planning your day and taking advantage of the fast pass system they offer. We all had such a great day and managed to ride all of the rides at least once or twice.We also enjoyed all of the shows even though they were in Japanese! Can't give this place enough praise, absolutely loved it! Can't wait to return!"
1047,5,16-Oct,Philippines,Disney is love,I fell like i am a princess in a fairy tale. I love the place. I remember my childhood and how i acted like cindirella lol
1048,5,17-Aug,N/A,One of our favourite days in Japan!,"The last time I visited any Disney resort was in the early 00's when I was only 5. I don't remember a lot so I persuaded my parents to come here so I could relive a lot of the experiences in those photographs that I wish I could remember. I was almost 18 this time, and this park did not disappoint me. We had such a fun day despite queues for the bigger rides being over an hour long. We actually took time to go on some smaller rides which were just as fun (Rodger Rabbits cartoon Spin was one of my highlights!) All of the other rides were great and my whole family enjoyed them. We didn't miss a parade either, and they were all brilliant too! Especially the beginning one - we didn't know we would get drenched in water but it was welcomed in the Tokyo summer heat (34C!) The food was lovely- we ate in the Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall which was beautifully decorated, however, I would recommend going to eat there just after dinner as we went right at dinner time and had to queue for a long time, but it was worth it!Everything at the park is done perfectly, none of the rides or decorations that we saw were under par. The staff are all incredibly friendly and welcoming. The park is so big, we only got to spend one day there but I would spend two! This park provides whatever you want out of it, whether that's small rides, bigger rides, parades, meet and greets, it really has it all! And I love it."
1049,1,17-Aug,N/A,Don't do it!,"My wife and I have visited all of the Disneyland parks in Southeast Asia (and Disney World in Orlando) and Tokyo Disneyland is by far the worst. If I were to put the Southeast Asia Disney parks in order of precedence, it would be Shanghai Disney in China, then Hong Kong Disney, then any other amusement park anywhere else, and then Tokyo Disney. All three of the good rides have 90 to 130 minute wait times and they are dulled down versions of the originals at the Magic Kingdom in Orlando. The restaurants in the park serve food that tastes like it was straight out of primary school lunches in the 1990's. If you are going to buy souvenirs, be prepared to pay three times what you would pay in the United States for the same item. We truly love Disney Parks but Tokyo Disney is a complete disappointment. "
1050,5,17-Aug,Brazil,Great as always ,"This Disneyland is way better than LA... It looks more organized and clean, more tech and less crowded. The attractions are pretty much the same but as always they provide entertainement and fun for all ages. Watch Disney characters speaking japanese is great. Lovely place to visit. Spend the dar um this place."
1051,5,17-Jul,N/A,Mickey!,"Grew up going to Disney World and Disney Land, have yet to experience Disney land somewhere else in the world.It was a great experience, friendly and childhood memories. I loved the different flavor popcorn and the mickey burger"
1052,4,17-Aug,Australia,Where dreams come true ,I don't think you can ever go wrong visiting Disneyland! We had an amazing time at Tokyo Disney. The fast pass system is very handy and made the experience much more enjoyable. Plan your day before you go so you get to ride on everything. We didn't get to see the fireworks because of wet weather but nonetheless it was a magical day! 
1053,5,16-Sep,Bangladesh,Dream comes True,"My first ever Disney Park visit - possibly the best start!! Amazing Disney with Japanese way of doing things make it a perfect experience. Make sure you start early to get the best out of the day - strategize to grab the fastapsses. There are some helpful apps which is helpful. The parades are simply amazing. Familiarize yourself with the park map, show times, ride rtings - so that u can best utilize the time for a memorable experience."
1054,5,17-Jun,Malaysia,Among the best Disneyland parks in the world,"This was our 4th visit to a Disneyland park after Los Angeles,Hong Kong & Paris. More or less the same layout for every park, but Tokyo Disneyland must have got the most accommodating staffs despite the language barrier. Every one of them was so friendly and helpful that any request ( as simple as asking for the guide book) would be met instantly. There was not even a 'no' answer. The only spoilers were a few Japanese ladies in kimonos who rudely asked for money when we asked to have them photographed with us. Not sure whether it's the park's policy though as I thought those wearing kimonos are only entitled to a discount on park entrance fees. All in all, we really enjoyed our time there even though it was a rainy season and a rather wet Disneyland visit."
1055,5,17-Aug,United States,Awesome fun in Tokyo,"If you love Disney you will really love Tokyo Disneyland.  My wife and 2 daughters have been to Disney world, Disneyland California, and Disneyland Paris.  In our opinion this is the best Disneyland (Disney world is a whole other place and Disneyland can fit in Disney world's parking lot).  However, this park was very well done.  The Japanese people are very into Disney making it very fun.  We never waited for more than 30 minutes on any ride and they have fast passes.  They have great parades and awesome shopping for gifts.  The food caters to the Japanese taste but Western food is available.  There are many of the classic rides and it is amazing to see it in Japanese!! An absolute must when going to Tokyo"

1057,5,17-Jul,United States,So fun!,"Of course it's the happiest place on earth! I loved to be there lots to see and do was there 10-10 and still didn't finish!One note, there are NO places to charge your phone. None! And if you want to use a plug you randomly find they will ask you not to use it lol I don't know why but everything is amazing "
1058,5,17-Jun,Australia,Dreams come true at Disneyland ,"We visited Tokyo Disneyland with our 3 young children aged 9, 7, 6 years. Our daughter is in a wheelchair and the staff at Disneyland were very helpful. We were given a special access pass which helped hold our spot in the sue without waiting. The disabled facilities were incredible- much better than in Australia. The park is very clean. The fast pass system works well. Our trip was even better than we could have imagined. We would highly recommend and look forward to coming back! "
1059,4,17-Jul,United States,Classics embraced,"This trip and this park took me back to my very first trip to Disneyland in California many, many years ago!!  I loved the classic rides like 20,000 leagues under the sea!  That was a favorite of mine and even though the story was told in Japanese I was happy to share this memory with my grown children and 7 year old Goddaughter.  They also had a ride from Pinocchio and the old Snow White adventure ride.  We had heard the Winnie the Pooh ride was worth riding even if you were an adult and we were so happy we rode it.  The characters from the Aristocats were walking around as well as many other characters, no meet and greet with long lines here!  "
1060,4,17-Aug,United States,Wonderful Experience,"Loads of shows, parades and attractions to keep you having a good time.  They still run the Electrical Parade, which is still a wonderful parade to see.  There are a lot of rules though that you typically do not find at other Disney parks (i.e. you have to sit while watching the parade and you can't set up until 1 hr prior).  The restaurants are bit on the mid-range price scale for the food you get."
1061,5,17-May,Australia,So much detail...,"One of the best things about visiting Tokyo Disneyland was looking at all the incredible detail in buildings and displays throughout the park. Look up, look down, peer around corners - the entire park is full of tiny details relevant to each themed area. Looking at the overall picture is amazing, but we found that looking at the details makes for a much more enchanting experience. Added to that, there were so many groups of people who dressed up in costumes or matching outfits for the day! Food wasn't too expensive, gifts were priced about where we expected. Overall, a long, tiring and thoroughly enjoyable day (and evening) out."
1062,4,16-Nov,United States,"Crowded, but fun.","This was my first Disney experience, I had never been to any in the states before I went to this one in Tokyo. I knew there would be long lines and a lot of people but it was a bit overwhelming how crowded it was! Aside from the crowds, my boyfriend and I had a wonderful experience. The staff were very friendly and spoke excellent English. The park was easily accessible via train. The park itself was very clean and there were many exciting attractions for all ages. I spent my 23rd birthday here it has certainly been the best birthday I've had so far!"
1063,5,17-Jun,Malaysia,Nice Disneyland ever!,"Visited after 8 years back, the park is very well maintained and clean. You can feel the excitement when enter the park! It is very crowded, just to prepare to line up for all attractions. Grab your fast pass too!"
1064,5,17-Jul,Netherlands,A Park so as not to get bored.,"We were there during the week gone, is really beautiful. Almost 80% of the visitors had certainly war by Mickey. Many Restaurant there cakes with coffee, and souvenir shops. I will find Tokyo Disneyland much more beautiful than Euro Disney."
1065,5,17-Jun,Australia,Best Disneyland in the world!,"The Japanese are great with organisation and courtesy which made our visit to Tokyo Disneyland very pleasant despite the rain and queues. Most of the fast pass rides did not require a fast pass - only a 30 minute wait. The pooh ride had the longest queue so save that to the end. And start at toon town and Mickey Mouse's house if you have small kids as small kids tend to get tired and fall asleep after a couple of rides. Most of all, you come out feeling happy and feel like a child again! True spirit of Disney here. "
1066,5,17-Jul,Australia,Who doesn't love Disneyland! ,"If your a Disney freak and going to all the Disney Parks than you must go! I found the park very spread out lots of walking between each land We went on Wednesday Thursday and Friday (Disney Sea as well) crowds were ok Large lines to get in each morning arriving an hour before park opens Fast passes do sell out very quickly you do need to have a plan when you first get into park, send the fastest to get the first fast pass while the rest of you go and line up for the first ride We we're disappointed with the characters hardly any and when you did see them they weren't interested in having photos with you almost ignored you if you were an adult the merchandise not even one Tshirt with 2017 on it actually almost nothing with 2017 lots of tin sweets and cookies Loved all the flavoured popcorn! "
1067,5,17-Jul,Australia,Get there early on a weekday.,"Loved Disneyland Tokyo. If you can go on a weekday and get to gates at least 1/2 an hour early it definately helps. Focus on getting quite a few rides done before stopping for character photos or shops. We got 7 rides done before 11.30am. We used a fast pass for splash mountain so waited no longer than 20 mins for a ride, with some being only 5 to 10mins. We did stop for the occasionally snack which were not too over priced. Then get a passout for some lunch and a rest. Then go back taking it a bit slower and expecting some longer waits. "
1068,5,17-Jun,United States,Great park ,"Very similar to magic kingdom , but with an Asian twist. We had fun . If you are a Disney fan you'll love it . If you have time to just visit one park go to Disney sea "
1069,5,17-Jul,Ireland,Fantastic Disney Park,"We had a fantastic time at Tokyo Disneyland. We were expecting high crowds, the same as what we experienced at Disney World in Florida, Disneyland California and Disneyland Paris but there was a low crowd here. We were able to go on all the rides that we didn't queue 2 hours for in other parks. It was great. The atmosphere was lovely. The cast members were friendly and helpful. I loved the way the cast members asked everyone to sit down for the parades so that everyone could see it. Every Disney park should do the same so that it's fair for all to see. I've been in Disney Parks before in which adults push kids aside so that they can see. Tokyo Disneyland allowed everyone a chance to see everything no matter how tall or small you are. It would have been nice if the park stayed open for longer (up to midnight) The night time show was on very early and there were few fireworks. It didn't have the same spectacular feel that you get at the Disneyworld light show and fireworks. Overall, we loved our time there and we would certainly return and recommend it to others. "
1070,4,17-Aug,Malaysia,Worth going to,"Tokyo Disneyland cost 7400 yen for an adult and 4800 yen for a child. This price is for 1 day pass. If you guys planning to go there, I would suggest you to go around 8am because the rides and entertainments are many. You will waste your time queueing, unless you have the Fastpass ticket which is sold at additional cost."
1071,5,17-Jul,United States,Wonderful Time,"I love Disneyland!  I like Tokyo Disneyland better than the park in Anaheim.  The cost of admission was much cheaper than in CA (7400 yen, around $68).  My daughter paid $125 a few weeks ago.  Everything is cheaper here.  A large coke was 300 yen (less than $3) and the pizza spring rolls (really yummy) were 270 yen.The rides are a little different than their California counterparts.  Space Mountain was better.  Peter Pan not as good.  No Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.  They still have the Spacejets (rockets in Tomorrowland).  Some of the CA Disneyland rides like Indiana Jones are in Disney Sea.The Electrical Parade was awesome.  The Queen of Hearts Dining Hall was neat but a little higher priced...stick to the desserts.Popcorn seems to be a big deal here.  It's a bit pricey if you buy a character container (about 2100 yen) but you can refill it for 510 yen both here and Disney Sea.  They have more than five varieties...shoyu butter and curry were the best.Attractions they don't have in CA are not to be missed.  Mickey's Philharmagic is a 3D musical show that was really good (and it felt good to sit down in an air-conditioned theater).  Pooh's Hunny Hunt was awesome.  Monster's Inc. Ride N Go Seek was good.Just a hint...ride Space Mountain and Splash Mountain as a single rider.  Just walk up to the fastpass line and hold up one finger (preferably your index finger and not the middle one) and you don't have to wait.  When we went, the standby line for Splash Mountain was 130 minutes...we were on in 10.  We rode multiple times.  The standby line for Space Mountain was 100 minutes, we were on in 5.  You don't get to ride with your friends/family, but we don't talk on the rides anyway.It's a Small World was closed.  It's weird hearing the narration on the rides in Japanese if you don't understand the language, but you get used to it.  "
1072,4,17-Jul,Sweden,similar to magickindon,"It is a Disney park so it is great, but do not expect modern toys, this one is more like magic kingdom."
1073,5,17-Jul,N/A,Happiest place on earth!!,"Totally recommend, the vibes of the place brings you joy and positivity which makes you never want to leave. I would recommend getting the fast pass for the ""Mountain"" rides because the queue tends to last forever and you might spend 120 mins waiting while by using the fast pass it wouldn't take more than 10 mins of standing in the queue. "
1074,5,17-Jun,Singapore,Worth it!,Who said Disneyland is for kids only? I beg to disagree! Me and my partner were so happy with this place! With the disney music all over the place plus disney characters walking around and please dont get me started with the food! It was amazing! It was cute and tasty and everything that you would expect food in Japan would be!
1075,4,17-Apr,United States,It's Disneyland in Tokyo!,"We managed to find the one major difference between the SoCal Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland:  somehow my husband, who is extremely frugal and anti-corporation, got super excited about the various types of popcorn available (he does love popcorn).  So, we got a big BB8 shaped bucket to refill the popcorn throughout the day - our favorites were curry, soy sauce, milk chocolate, white chocolate, and sea salt.  Totally worth it!"
1076,5,17-Jun,United States,Wonderful Theme Park,"This is a great theme park and one of if not the best Disney ""castle"" parks in the world.  Well run, clean, and wonderfully themed.  Pales a bit in comparison to its neighbor DisneySea, but great if you have a small kids.  The cast members are enthusiastic and friendly and go out of their way to help even when there's a language barrier.  It was very easy to get in the park (very efficient security and ticket checks) and the price is very reasonable especially in comparison to US parks.  The food is fantastic.  Loved the chocolate and caramel popcorns and came home with an awesome BB8 popcorn holder. The chicken waffle sandwiches are fantastic - you get those at Camp Woodchuck. Lots of funky snacks and things that are worth trying.  We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel and got the Happy 15 early entry which enabled us to ride a couple extra things during the day.   Very worth it.  The parades especially the electric parade are great.  The rides are the usual Disney assortment with a few unique ones thrown in.  Pooh's Honey Hunt was great but was broken a lot of the day so we could only ride it once.  Monsters Inc we found to be overrated, really nothing special.  But the usual rides like Haunted Mansion, Pirates, Splash Mountain, Big Thunder, etc, were all wonderfully themed and fun.  Lines were manageable in the middle of the week but fast passes helped a lot. Very sadly both Space Mountain and Small World were closed during our visit.  Boo. Also the fireworks were cancelled when we were there due to ""high winds"" but the winds were pretty light.  Disappointing.  But overall this is a park not to be missed.  Get there early and stay late - it's lots of fun!"
1077,4,17-Jul,United States,Classic Disney,"This park is classic Disney.  Growing up in S Florida I'm a 3-4 times per year Disney World visitor.  Tokyo Disney Land felt like Disney World back in the 90s (and it's not a bad thing).  They have rides here that have long been removed from Disney World.  The parks seems to be more spread out vs Disney World which gives the sense of it being leas crowded.  But then you try to get on the more popular rides and you are reminded that you are at a Disney park.   As an international traver it was a bit of a challenge to find food for my kids.  They are a bit picky, and traveling internationally doesn't help.   One thing i wasn't used to was having to pay to ride the monorail.  You can get a one way ticket or an all day pass.   Having to pay to ride the monorail really left a bad taste.  We stayed at the Sheraton Grande which is on property and the monorail station is right in front of hotel.  i dont know why, but there is a Disney shuttle that takes you from the station to the hotel.  it didn't really make sense to me since the station is literally across the street.  Although the bus is really Disney-decorated so i guess you have to ride it once.  I also was not very impressed with the .merchandise offered at the various shops.  The one thing that bothered me was the stores did not remain opened much longer after park closed.  Disney World in Orlando will keep stores on Main Street opened a significant amount of time after the park closes.  They want to ensure they get as much money out of you as possible.  Last thing that i disliked was the covered structure over Main Street.  It just takes away from the feel of Main Street.  i understand it is to protect guests from the elements, i just didn't like the look and feel.Bottom line, if you are a Disney fan you dont want to miss going to Tokyo Disney if you are in Tokyo.  "
1078,5,17-Jul,Australia,Fantastic,"Disneyland is everything you expect and some things you don't. Being the first Disneyland I have ever been to it didn't hold a lot of surprises for me. It was everything I expected, except the prices. the food and drink prices were amazingly cheap as was the merchandise. I was totally blown away by the cheapness of everything. we went on a weekday where the crowds are less, however this didn't stop the lines for the rides. You can get a fast pass and basically book a time so you don't have to wait in line.We went with out children and still had a good time, but I think the magic of Disney is for those of a younger age and would be a memory your children would keep forever, its a big day but is totally worth it."
1079,4,17-Jul,N/A,Not the best but still good,Obviously being at Disneyland already gives off amazing vibes! Tokyo Disneyland was definitely great to see and enjoyable! The best part was the amazing light show at the end of the night as well as the projection show on the castle. So beautiful!The shops were a bit disappointing as it was all generic and there was nothing that said 'Tokyo Disneyland' as a souvenir on it. No characters around it to get photos with. Overall good but not great.
1080,5,17-May,United States,No complaints on price - it is worth it - everyone will love it!,"With good access by metro train or by using buses from different locations, one could comfortably reach Disney Land.   We went in May and hence Easter attractions were addition and they were very colorful.  (Winne the) Pooh hunt, Monsters Inc,, Haunted Mansion were few of the key attractions that we went and used Fast Pass for two of them.   Pooh hunt wait for us (without Fast Pass) in the queue is little more than 2 hours.   Pirates of the Caribbean set was amazing - our travelling boat looks like miniature next to a gigantic ship setting.   We went a lot of rides and my kids enjoyed them thoroughly.  Small world attraction was closed when we went, but the Usatama song in the parade was similarly catchy and nostalgic.   I have  been to Disney World Fforida, Disney Land Los Angeles and Disney Land Paris earlier - Tokyo one was equivalently great.   One thing I noted is lot of locals here against what we experienced in other places - rarely we seen foreigners like us when we went, this is not a complaint but just an observation.   Souvenirs sold are expensive as expected, but no complaints.  Enchanted Tikki show is lovely and the commentary by a host there was interesting.   Different flavored  popcorns are available and everyone make effort to eat as many flavors as possible.   At the end in the night, grand finale of million LEDs parade, light shows and fire works are absolutely stunning.   If you are in Tokyo and have time, do not miss this attraction."
1081,5,17-Jul,N/A,What Disney is supposed to be!,"The cast members at the park were well trained and polite, Everyone used at least a little English to  greet us."
1082,3,16-Aug,Kuwait,expected better,its not for adults... mostly for children..we enjoyee the themed snacks as each area had a specific popcorn UNUSUAL flavours ..(strawberry..milktea...etc) .. if you go during a holiday the queue can reach 180 mins!! plan your trip ahead and come VERY early..plan to RUN if you wanna see all the attracions
1083,5,17-May,Indonesia,Best Disneyland,"I've been to Disneyland Paris, Disneyland Hong Kong, Disneysea. And this place top it all.It is fun to see not only the park itself, but also the visitors. Japanese definitely know how to do cosplay! Watching the young-Japanese visitor is half the fun of this place.Anyway, whoever responsible to run this place, should be proud to themselves. Everyone did an amazing job. Almost cry when i have to go home.. "
1084,5,17-Jul,Saudi Arabia,Wonderful place to be!!!!! Worth the money,It is a wonderful place to be. Kids enjoy it a lot. Many rides for both adults and kids. Enjoyed the rides with kids. Monsters inc. Star Wars. Space mountain. Buzz light year critter city fantasy land(was closed for maintenance) cinderellas castle too much to write but best to experience it yourself. Worth the money spent. Trick bring your own food and water for at least half a day. If you r visiting Muslim family try to bring your own food for whole day. It gets very crowded and waiting time for rides can be as long as 70mins or more. Try to check online before you go to choose appropriate day by looking at crowd calendar anything under 50 should be good. Try to choose your rides if you are specific about them. You can choose the fast pass option avaialable per ticket every 2 hours only. Overall great place to visit full of fun activities. Loved it and the kids want to go again as soon as possible.
1085,5,17-Jul,New Zealand,Definately worth it,"We made the mistake of doing a full day at Disneysea and were bored by 1pm.  Disneyland we did a twilight pass and it was a much better park for us with more to do.  The splash mountain rides was fun and space mountain plus thunder mountain and we did the pirates ride which was more of a float down the stream of a movie set - the scenes were very good though.  The show was amazing and the park is well kept.  Most vendors close stores just after the show and we were bit slow to get some themed items, so shop just before the show for popcorn and drink buckets etc.  We didn't want to drag them along and had intended to get them at the end but it was too late.  The twilight pass was good and we got in quite a few rides.  Easy to get to on trains and imagine our surprise we had rush hour on the train from tokyo station back to hotel at 11pm on a weekday!  Adds to the fun."
1086,5,17-Jul,India,Back to childhood fun!!! ,"Undoubtedly a must visit if one is on a leisure trip in the fast moving city of Tokyo. FOR ALL THE CONTEMPLATING MINDS, YES IS THE ANSWER,  PLS VISIT IT. it is so so much fun to recall all the cartoon character s st Disneyland. The Disney parade is fabulous and an experience to repose in. Every things is so so so immaculate. The Disney castle is just so true. I truly enjoyed the visit with family and yes if u r running out of time it has post 6pm half day entry packages also.  So explore and customize Ur visit at ur convenience. Strongly recommended visit. "
1087,5,17-Jul,Australia,Loved it!,Great rides and shows! Staff very helpful. Easy to get to. Stay for the night show very beautiful!!!
1088,5,17-Jun,Philippines,Enjoyed every second,"The moment you step through the turnstile, you already feel it, the atmosphere is just so... fun. Disney characters are taking pictures, and nothing changes once you go inside. Tip: Head left to Adventureland, because most people go right. While you're there at that side of the park, don't miss Jungle Cruise. It's probably the best one (with the best skipper) I've ever ridden. If you don't understand Japanese, don't worry, the gestures tell you everything you need to know. Then head clockwise, towards Fantasyland. The kids will have major fun here, and usually some short-line steals are Peter Pan's Flight and the PhilharMagic show. Don't forget to nab fastpasses for Splash Mountain and Pooh's Hunny Hunt, as those are in that area. A pleasant surprise in this Disneyland was that you could actually go inside the iconic castle, and this one has a walkthrough Cinderella-themed art exhibit. Then last but not least, Tomorrowland. A lot of good rides are located in one complex there (Space Mountain, Monster's Inc.) and there's a stretch of walkway there with snack carts left and right, and one of my personal favorites is the flavored churro :) You can get one in many places around both parks, but the flavor depends on where you are. We were there at dusk, and I loved seeing all the lights turn on :> After dark, do not miss the Once Upon A Time show projected on the castle. The montage of Disney films (set to gorgeous music) is the magical cherry on top of a tiring day, making you forget how much your feet hurt at the time. It just shows you the perennial charming quality of Disneyland that makes it worth going back to, a little pocket of timeless magic in our ever-changing world :)"
1089,5,17-May,Malaysia,Little Family Trip,Is very nice of a place.........üòçüòòüëçif have a time i will think go againüë™‚ùÑÔ∏èi will choose winter season  if goüòáüòá
1090,3,17-Jul,N/A,Disney Sea has more to offer ,"If you've been to the Disneyland in LA then you can give this a miss. Instead I would recommend Disney Sea. If you've never been to a Disneyland before then I would still recommend Disney Sea, my friend was in that boat and even she said she wished she went to the other one instead. If you do go however, do make sure to try the caramel popcorn and the big turkey legs. "
1091,5,17-Jun,Spain,Second time in Tokyo Disneyland,"I'm a big fan of Disneyland ! I have been to This one and the one in HK and of course all the parks in the US! but I would say that the Tokyo Disneyland is suit for you to go with your children because they always give you some convenient and unexpected by nice service when it comes to with the kids! I love everything here and I do enjoy the show and the time there for sure. There is only one pity thing is that we didn't see the fireworks due to the big wind .. It was like first time happened in my life which is a bit disappointed, but still more good memories there !‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è "
1092,5,17-Jul,United States,Summer family vacation,"The park is just as large as California theme park, If you can get there early in the morning, you can just about complete the park before closing time 10:00PM. Are family had the time of their lives especially the two grand kids 9 & 10. Memories forever, lots of places to eat and rest from the miles of walking.   "
1093,5,17-Apr,Australia,Happiest Place on Earth!,"I took my 3 kids and my wife there and i cant be more happier! the people were friendly, the venue was clean, the wait is reasonable acceptable for major theme parks. cant recommend it more as a must visit in Tokyo!"
1094,3,17-Jul,N/A,Average,Not as it should beVery big difference between disneyland paris and in the USFriendly staff but they don't understand english
1095,5,17-Feb,Malaysia,Wonderful day in Tokyo Disneyland !,"Very popular attraction for local and foreigners. I bought the ticket via online and we just need to print out the e-ticket and scan the bar code to enter the park. We woke up real early that day to queue up because we want to get the fast pass as soon as possible so that we can play more games. At the end of the day, our mission accomplished, we able to play all the games that we wish to play except we gave up the thunder mountain the night parade. Upon entering the park, warm welcome was given by all the staffs and everyone inside the park is feeling joyful and happy. Make sure you got the leaflet & map from the staffs so that you know what time is the parade will start and the location of the games. You wouldn't want to miss any of the parade because it was amazing.I will definitely come back again and i wish to visit the Tokyo Disneysea for my next visit to Japan."
1096,5,17-Jul,N/A,More then just one day,This would be the 10th time we have been to Disneyland everytime we come there is always something a little different that keeps the magic alive . Our kids stay awake some how to 10 at night for all 3 days . We spend 2 days a Disneyland and one at Disney sea. Disneyland is more shows and rides for smaller kids with meeting spots all around and a great light and fireworks show at the end of the night . Can always find something to eat or sit down. I found everything and everyone was english friendly so had no problems.  If kids like mickey mouse the toontown is a must . Go to mickey mouses house and you get a video and photo with mickey in his house . Always a line up but as normal everything seems to run smoothly.  A note if you or child has birthday in or around that time tell staff and ask for sticker. Every staff that see that sticker will wish happy birthday and some even give little sticker gifts . Then you cant wipe smile of your little ones faces.  We spend one day doing shows and one day doing rides.  And pictures in between.  Use fast passes wisely can get every 2 hours woryh the line up to get means you can plan your day.  And one mans dream is a special ticket show where you have to win tickets ro see. There is a area in tomorrowland that yuou go to see if you win tickets. Not many visitors get the chance to do . All in japanese but the show is easy to understand . Just remember if you go just enjoy yourself . Disneyland has everything else. 5 starsKids have it a 7 hahaha have fun people and hope it helps
1097,5,17-Jun,N/A,Amazing!,"We got the 4 day pass for Disneyland and Disneysea and I would definitely recommend this! We spent the first 2 days at Disneyland and the second two at Disneysea, heading back to Disneyland for the last few hours of our last day. This was our first visit to a Disneyland and we were not disappointed. We took our 9 and 11 year old daughters and we had just as much fun as they did. Our 11 year old is not a thrill seeker at all (neither are my husband and I) but really enjoyed all the rides at Disneyland. Splash Mountain was a bit of a push initially but she ended up doing it 3 times and she absolutely loved Big Thunder Mountain. The drop on Splash Mountain is pretty steep but isn't as bad as it looks. This ride is amazing on the inside and lasts about 8 minutes - really worth it! The majority of the rides are aimed at children so there is nothing too scary.The Disney fast pass system is fantastic! You don't need to pay any extra but are only allowed a fast pass about every couple of hours. After the first day, you get this system pretty well sorted. We went straight to the ride we wanted a fast pass for. The fast pass machines are normally by the ride queue. The ticket tells you the hour time slot to come back in and you could go and enjoy the other rides. The fast pass ticket also tells you the time you can get another fast pass so we just made sure we always had a new ticket when we were allowed one. They are only available on the most popular rides but really are worth it as it cuts the line time considerably.The morning parade was ok but the afternoon and evening parade as well as 'Once upon a time' are not to be missed - just breathtaking. I was blown away by 'Once upon a time' as they project the story images onto the castle - amazing! After you have seen the parades once, on the next day, these times are the best to get short queues in the rides as most other people are at the parades.We were pleasantly surprised by the cost of food. There is a huge range of options and for a theme park, they are really reasonably priced. Because the main purpose of our trip was Disneyland, we stayed at an airbnb in Urayasu. This was perfect as we just got a bus 5 minutes up the road to Disneyland for 150 yen. We were also able to easily navigate the bus and train system to get to other areas of Tokyo (with the help of Google Maps). We flew into Narita airport which is about an hour from the city!! Next time we would fly into Haneda. However it wasn't too bad. We got the airport limousine bus to Urayasu and then the Narita Express train from the Tokyo station back as we were leaving early in the morning and the Limousine bus hadn't started yet. I downloaded the Tokyo Taxi app to get us to the ShinUrayasu train station at 5am that morning. I checked this worked when we were in Tokyo city a few days before and it was fine. When I went to use it that morning it told me I was out of range for the app!! Eek! So Uber it was, however, the Uber driver had to come from the other side of Tokyo so it took him half an hour to get to us. We were cutting it fine but made it in the end. Overall, we were blown away by Disneyland and had a fantastic time!"
1098,5,16-Aug,Greece,Magic!!,I can't even begin to describe the joy and magic one feels when inside this place. Try not to miss the opportunity to visit it!
1099,5,17-Jun,United States,Great experience ,As an American who has experienced the multiple Disney parks in the US we went in with high expectations and weren't disappointed.  We went on a weekday and the park was crowded but the wait times were still very reasonable.  We were able to ride most everything in 6 hours.  The park is exceptionally clean and everyone was friendly.  We anticipated a language barrier but most everything we needed we could communicate or the cast member spoke English.  The Disneyland park is very small and can easily be navigated.  Many of the rides and attractions are identical to the ones you see in the states but are still fun.  If you find yourself with nothing to do in Tokyo I recommend checking it out. 
1100,5,16-Oct,Bahrain,Young at Heart,Tokyo Disneyland is a place for the young and old. It is always a happy place.  One day is certainly not enough because of the long qeues in the rides and in the restaurant. But its beautiful and well organized.
1101,5,16-Aug,United States,Beautiful Park Filled with Happy People,"What a beautiful Disney Park by the Sea. The people were the highlight as they dress in anything that has to do with Disney. We loved every minute of our visit. The highlight was the Indiana Jones ride and seeing all the people dressed in Disney anything!We've been to all the USA locations several times and Disney Paris as well and can recommend this Disneyland Tokyo Park as a wonderland way to spend the day!There are long lines, you do need to plan ahead. For more photos see my Disney By the Sea Review."
1102,4,17-Jun,United Arab Emirates,Well organized and great service quality,"Went on a week day and the park was crowded but not to the limit. Although I started panicking expecting long lines at every attraction, things ended up going very smoothly mainly thanks to the very professional and efficient staff (This makes a big difference to other Disney Parks). Long lines were indeed a fast transit , never went beyond 30 min, most were 20 min avg. Only two downsides were the total lack of Wi-Fi and the fact that Fast-Pass is actually a system that makes you acquire a ticket to enter the line several hrs later. Say, you get it at the machine at midday and you can ride at 1800. Tends to be a closing times.... some fast pass lines were longer than the standard! not a lot of sense on this. In any case, food was great, all attractions were very good, except for the space ride closed.......... this seems to be a doomed attraction though, is always shut off. Again, weekday, early comer and late leaver."
1103,5,17-Mar,Australia,Disneyland is huge,Its a fantastic place to go and one day is certainly not enough I would suggest a 2-3day pass if you have the time we certainly look forward to going back there again
1104,4,17-Jun,N/A,Had a good time ,"My family and I had a great time at Tokyo Disney. The staff was great and everyone was quite helpful. My children (11, 9) grew bored during some of the rides because of the language barrier. We went during the week (Monday), so the wait time was no more than 15 minutes. As native Floridians Disney lovers, our expectations were probably a bit high, so that might have jaded our experience. Overall, it was a great experience. We would definitely visit again. "
1105,2,17-Jun,N/A,Racism in Tokyo Disneyland is quite true.,"At the entrance, Mickey Mouse and other figures greet people especially children. Everybody was taking photo with them hugging, hand shaking etc. It is mentionable that all of them were Japanese. But, when we insisted taking a photo, he crossed his arms giving most unfriendly posture."
1106,4,17-Jun,Thailand,Feel like back to school ,We have been there last year with families. We love parades at Main Street. Mickey Mouse and his band of high energy drummers. Transportation is very convenient. We booked at Air BnB we take a bus to Disneyland very easy. We took a lots of images around the castle area with lots of Jap girls wearing Disney clothes. Such a great time and feel like back to school ;)
1107,4,16-Dec,Australia,Had Fun,"The review was written by my 8-year-old son and un-edited:It was pretty nice. We had to wait a long time to get on rides. Splash mountain was my favourite ride. We had to wait about 2 hours and I got tired, bored and hungry by waiting.Some rides were painful because I moved too much in the seat, like space mountain.Donald Duck tried to hug me, which I didn't really want. I felt like punching him because he got too aggressive by trying to hug me. The pizza was pretty nice but not the best and I expected better like Italy's pizza.Overall it was pretty nice (except for Donald Duck trying to hug me)."
1108,5,16-Dec,N/A,Not as beautiful as Disney Tokyo Seas,"Although we had a great time at this park, Disney Tokyo Seas was a lot more picturesque. Our favorite ride was definitely Pooh Corner. Even though the line for the Fast Pass was long (20 minute wait), it was much better than the stand-by line which was 3x the wait. What stood out for us was the Train (Western River Railroad), which is a mode of transportation around the park at Disneyland, is actually an attraction which travels at the outskirts of Adventureland and Westernland. "
1109,5,17-Jun,Vietnam,Amzing,"We went to Disneyland for two days and DisneySea for two days. Well what can I say amazing. The staff were all super friendly waving all the time, the people were all very friendly and polite. It was well organised at the parades everyone sits down which means you can see everything and there is no pushing. The tickets are good value for money. There are new rides being built at the moment so it may be worth waiting for those to finish.Loved the food and did not spend to much  money!"
1110,2,17-Jun,N/A,"""Fast"" pass","70 minute wait for the Tower of Terror ride, 3pm in the afternoon, the park closes at 10pm and the fast pass is closed. Go figure. What's the point of ""fast""pass if you close it over 7 hours before the park closes? All of the shows are in Japanese and very few staff speak  English. Olympics in 2020 - good luck with that"

What an exhausted day and boring to allow me for writing this message during waiting.....
1112,3,16-Dec,Australia,Bit outdated,"Thought Disneyland Tokyo was one of the best in Asia, but it seems to be a bit outdated.  Heard it is Disney sea is the place to go, but didn't go because it was winter and it was very cold.  All shows are in Japanese, so we didn't understand what the shows are about.  But I guess it is like that in all non english speaking countries.  Good for young kids.  The food was good."
1113,4,17-Jun,India,"Its Disneyland, what else to say","What's goodThe access through rail system is easy. Disneyland is easily navigable. There are staff planted everywhere to help you. Tomorrowland is amazing.What's not goodToo many shops make it feel like a mall. There are few rides which are clearly for children below 5. Need to put some rating. Built in 1983, the park does seem old and little out of date but then it's Disneyland.What to doTry the roller coasters which are really fun. Tomorrowland has a Star War 3D tour which is amazing. Splash Mountain had a long queue but was fun."
1114,3,17-Jun,Singapore,"Exhorbitant Charges, Trying Experience - If You Can't Communicate in Japanese","The visuals attract. The fairytale castle, the quaint period buildings housing shops and diners, the costumed crew, the themed coaches, the delightful Parades, the unique rides.In general, the hardware pleases. The software - the human touch, failed miserably. I felt this. My take is that Tokyo Disneyland is meant for Jap speakers specifically.There was an obvious lack of roving Disney characters for photo ops. My entire day there only sighted Goofy & Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum. Both acts were chaperoned by crew members who, without exception, set up photo ops for Jap speaking visitors. I needed paracetamol tablets. I approached 5 crew members gathered at the water cooler shed, next to the First Aid cross signage. I showed them the box I had bought in Tokyo. They chorused "" Sorry"" with clenched fisted arms crossed ""x"" before their chests. I pointed to my head, said ""pain"", and pointed to the First Aid cross signage. All I got were crossed arms, although with beaming smiles - which I registered as fake.I rested at the same shed. Near Parade time, the crew chased me out. No one was allowed in the shed except those who need to drink water from the cooler .. and then go. I complied, hobbling on my walking stick to stand behind the shed, in the hot sun.Just before the Parade started, the rope barrier was released and a group of Japanese visitors were allowed to sit where I was chased away. Not good.I asked how long to queue to do the Pirates of the Carribean ride. 20 minutes, I was told. And how long will the ride take? 20 minutes. I was told again. I don't think they understood me.After queuing for 30 mins, I was ready to board the boat. I signaled to the crew manning the admission that I was travelling alone, with my walking stick. She waved me on to queue no 4. I struggled onto the boat. No help was offered or rendered.Having settled in, 2 crew members came and gestured me to move to the boat at the back. There was no finesse or politeness in their communication. I lifted my walking stick to show them moving is an issue for me.Regardless, they continued their Japanese jabbering. Embarrassed and upset, I struggled out of the boat. Again, no help was offered or rendered. The crew didnt bother to help me to the alternate boat. When I left the ride area, none the crew cared. The smiles weren't there anymore. Also, no smiles showed on me. For Sure! Yes, I forgo the ride after the lengthy queuing. There was definitely no Disney mood to be had.Look closely at some pics I have attached. Benches meant for 5 to 6 to sit were occupied by lesser numbers... with bags etc taking up the empty spaces. Crew members aren't monitoring this enough. In the heat of the day, there is no shaded area set up for the infirm, the very old or very young.My experience is that Disneyland Tokyo need to be more humane. I am wishing upon a star for that to happen."
1115,4,17-Jun,Japan,Great Time,Our family really enjoyed Tokyo Disneyland. Going during the week was a great idea.  The park was not as congested.  We rode a majority of the rides and watched the parade with ease. Did everything in one day. Great family day. 
1116,2,17-Jun,N/A,Over-hyped & Over-crowded,"Star Tours - the Star Wars themed building makes the 45 minute queue more bearable and the 5 minute ride itself was allot of fun. A second viewing around 6pm the queue was about 20 minutes long (online, the queue was apparently 5 minutes long) and I noticed some differences in the second movie showing - no spoilers. This was mine and my older boy's favorite ride.The  movie Theater was also enjoyable with the cinnamon smells, water splashes and curved-screen 3D.Small-World was closed and the queues for Splash-mountain were so long the entire day we didn't even bother.Nasa rockets, dumbo and tea-cups were fun but far too short-lived. These are basic (but still fun) rides which probably would have no queues somewhere like Drayton Manor or Alton Towers.The Roger-Rabbit ride lasted a bit longer but the ride itself was a very disappointment experience.Got the fast-pass at 9am and the earliest time for use was 7.10pm.The adventure island is fun for small children - especially the rock and tree-house. I would advise a picnic lunch and eat it on this island since there was hardly any people there and there.The fast-food is terrible, but the ice-lollies, pop-corn and drinks are OK. Bring a tooth-brush.The toilets and park in general was exceptionally clean. The staff are exceptionally helpful and friendly, but there are too many rules on do's and don'ts and directing traffic, waiting lines, no-go areas, etc... you start getting annoyed at the staff anyway.Having been to many theme-parks in my life, I can say without doubt the queuing for the nicely themed rides vs the reward and time spent on those rides is the lowest I've ever encountered.Tokyo Dome is more fun than this place. Ueno zoo is more fun for kids and adults  than this place.The prices for tickets, parking, food etc... is too high for what you get. Your paying for the brand and a ""themed"" experience, where you will spend almost the entire time queuing for what amounts to children's rides you can find better at Gypsy fairs on bonfire night with less queuing and cheaper prices.Disney seem to own or control the entire island so no visible convenience stores, restaurants or drink machines outside of the park like you see everywhere throughout the rest of Tokyo.Perhaps the American and French Disney theme parks are better! Adverts in Disney films and TV would have you believe there are people dressed-up as Disney characters everywhere in the park. (It would be a nice touch if they entertained the kids along the queues). That's not the case, but there are a few photo-opps here and there if you don't mind queuing 45 minutes+ for a picture with Donald-duck. I didn't see any Mickey-Mouse of Minnie-Mouse photo-opps.Apparently if you go during winter when it's raining and cold it's possible to avoid the crowding and queues. The colleague at work also mentioned having time to use 4 fast-passes in one day with his family."
1117,5,17-May,N/A,Vacation that requires planning and strategy.,"We bought the tickets from the partner hotel we stayed in. We traveled tail end of May 2017. Have a game plan on where to go/ride first and what to fast pass while you're in line. Download an app that will show you wait times for attractions. The lines are indeed long but nobody cuts in line or whines in line, hence if they say 1hr 20mins in line, then expect no more than 1hr 20mins.  Shows, dialogue are in Japanese so don't expect subtitles or English shows.  Cast members actually call people to sit in designated areas to watch parades - as long as those areas aren't filled up yet.What makes Tokyo Disneyland different from other parks would be the Japanese culture that you feel in the park.  Their own unique theme park culture is part of what makes Tokyo Disneyland worth experiencing."
1118,5,17-Apr,Australia,Exciting,Summer my 4 year old granddaughter loved every visit here. There is just way too much to do to see Disneyland in one dayWe went on all the rides spent hours in the kiddies sections. She loved everything about it and we adults also enjoyed ourselves. Her absolute favourite was  meeting Princess Aurora. Plenty of food and drinks around the park and very good maps of the layout
1119,4,17-Jun,United States,Great Park for Disney Fans,"This was our first park to visit while in Tokyo and we found it nice and charming.  The cast members are extremely friendly and we had no issues asking questions.The park has a lot of the same rides that the US parks do, but the main one that it does not have is the Pooh's Honey Hut.  We rode this about 4 times.  It is a trackless ride and there are 3 cars per group.  Each car does something different, so be sure to ride each car at least once.We also found that the food was not as expensive in the states and also of much better quality.  We snacked a lot on different types of foods and they were all delicious.The only thing I definitely recommend is that you need to get here before rope drop so you can get on as many rides as possible and work to get your fast passes quick.  This park fills up fast and the locals know how to work the fast pass system.  We came on a weekday to try and mitigate the crowds and we got on all the rides we wanted, but I am glad we did a weekday with extra magic 15."
1120,5,17-Jun,Taiwan,The Best Place in the Earth,You really feel you are going back home as they are so welcome you!  My fist visit this time and starting to plan to come back next year.Staff are so professional and talented.  I appreciated their smiles and shows.  Sweet memories to us!
1121,5,17-Jun,United States,Disney Magic,We have visited Walt Disney resort in Orlando more than 10 times. We have visited Disneyland California and also Disneyland Paris and in spite of other opinions I have to say that here is also the magic of Disney. Our experience was fantastic! Even at breakfast they helped us find hidden Mickeys. Do not stop visiting it! Every park in the world has its magic!
1122,4,17-Jun,N/A,Disneyland ,Good for children Disneyland i came here on April so hot that time. There are many people in there at that time because it was a holiday.
1123,5,17-Jun,United Kingdom,Fantastic !,"You really feel you are in Tokyo with a beautiful pond full of carp and wonderful buildings.We ate in the Tokyo restaurant. You need to book but it is truly authentic setting. You can book to sit round the griddle or just book a table. With little ones we booked a table . The children's meals were wonderfully presented in stacked bowls. The service was good . The food was fantastic. The tempura was wonderfully crisp and light( try the tempura lobster) . Great sushi and noodles. Good drinks , wine and cocktails list.Well worth a visit"
1124,4,17-Jun,Iceland,great day,"awesome day lots of fun for my 1st disney visit , loving the negative comments about to many japanese and japanese language hilarious.. people feel so entitled these days just chill and enjoy"
1125,4,17-Jun,China,Good,"Really good experience. Lines were pretty short. An hour at the longest. I went on June 14 and there still was the Usatama (Easter) parade. Compared to Tokyo DisneySea, Disneyland definitely has less thrill rides. Disneyland has more rides for younger children. The best thing to eat that I highly recommend are the Pizza Spring Rolls in Toontown. Those things are seriously heavenly. Cast members are really nice and considerate. Merchandise is adorable. Tokyo Disneyland is a great amusement park."
1126,4,17-Apr,United States,Fun!,It feels the same as the Disneyland in Anaheim - in terms of the rides and themes.  The Pooh's hunny hunt ride was closed during our time there so we were very disappointed as this is supposed to be different from the one in Anaheim.  Still an enjoyable visit to the park.  The easter parade was very well done.
1127,4,17-Jun,Singapore,Pure Disney Magic,"Had an excellent time with my kids 4 and 6 years old. They have rides for all ages. The popular rides had very long lines. Get the free fast pass for the popular rides as soon as you can. There is time limit before you can get a fast pass for the next ride. The fastpass machines are located next to their respective rides. Just scan your ticket at the machine to be issued the fastpass. The fastpass will designate a specific time for you to return to take the ride. For popular rides such as Buzz lightyear and Star Wars, the standby lines were quite short past 9pm (I was there on a Monday). Managed to take the Star Wars ride only once in the morning but 3 times after 9pm. Splash mountain was fantastic but the lines were long, even with the fastpass the wait was 10-15mins. If you have young children, do get a contact sticker from customer service next to the main entrance and stick it on their shirts in case they get lost in the park. After you write your details on the sticker, do cover it with the Disney logo sticker also provided with the contact sticker. In the event your kid gets lost, the staff will peal off the Disney logo to reveal your child's name and contact info. There is a centre for lost children next to the entrance. Hope this helps. Have fun!"
1128,5,17-Jun,N/A,Very nice place to visit,"Nice place, all their staff very friendly. Food a little bit expensive but worth for money. Enjoy happily inside üëçüèø"
1129,5,17-May,Malaysia,wonderful Tokyo Disneyland,its a great place to spend time with family or friends or couple whether honeymoon or holidays. best time of the year to visit is March & April where weather is cool. when I was there in May its already hot & sunny
1130,3,17-May,N/A,Lack of English announcements or signages ,"I was a first timer to Tokyo Disney. Frustrated by most staff speaking only Japanese. Regardless of listeners understanding they kept speaking their native language only... Going thru long lines everywhere, neither signages nor announcements in English. All made me more tired. "
1131,3,17-May,Indonesia,Tokyo Disney is worse than Hongkong Disney,"According to my opinion, Hongkong Disney is much better than Tokyo Disney..several games and attractions are same. no fireworks when i went there, due to the weather problems,so i got double dissapointed. But its okay because i went there with my husband to celebrate our 11th wedding anniversary."
1132,5,17-May,Australia,Better than USA Disney...,"This might be a controversial statement, but I think Tokyo Disneyland is way better than the one in LA (and probably Florida, too).The Magic Kingdom parks are all pretty similar, but I've found there are way more characters out and about to get photos with (YAY!) in Tokyo. There's a really good range of non-rollercoaster rides (Winnie the Pooh ride is VERY popular).The food is lovely (much nicer than the USA parks) and pretty affordable, by theme park standards.But what I really couldn't get over was how NICE everyone was. Even in the crowded sections, people were very considerate, spoke at a quiet level, and were just purely happy to be there. We also noticed there seemed to be more of a young adult audience than families with young kids (aka no sea of prams to avoid bumping in to)."
1133,5,17-May,United States,Great for Disney fans!,"Look up tips for visiting the Tokyo Disney Parks, its extremely helpful when deciding the length and time of year to go. I didn't have any ""I wish.."" regrets with a day and a half, but it wasn't crowded and we went on everything within the first half of the day. We dedicated more of our stay to DisneySea.Get in line an hour before the park opens, there will be at least 40 people already there waiting. When the park opens every goes to get fast passes for Pooh's Honey Hunt and Monster's Inc Ride & Go Seek. I'd recommend getting a fast pass for Monster's Inc, it's closer, then getting in the stand-by line for Pooh's Honey Hunt. We went on these rides multiple times, they were that fun. I would recommend going on everything, it is Disneyland, but these were my favorites: Monster's Inc Ride & Go SeekPooh's Honey HuntHaunted MansionSplash MountainSpace MountainCinderella's Fairy Tale HallMUST-SHOWS- it's mainly in Japanese, but still very entertainingOnce Upon A Time- (it will close permanently in November 2017)-there is a pretty identical version that was recently placed in Walt Disney WorldWe ate at the Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall, a great Alice in Wonderland theme. It was cafeteria style dining, and a cast member seats you after you have paid."
1134,4,16-Jul,Kuwait,Small park ,"I was disappointed to find out the park was small comparing to the ones in Florida and los angels , but other than that , the park was worth to visit , with the same theme and songs ."
1135,4,17-May,Australia,To tick of the list,"Tokyo Disneyland was my first Disneyland and thankfully we went pre school holidays - although it was still substantially busy. Since we stayed at a Disney hotel we managed to get early gate access tickets (so 15 minutes). Every bit of audio in the park and on rides was in Japanese and there were no subtitles, we were also turned away from a couple of theatre and digital experiences for this reason. Still worth the trip however we purchased a 2 day pass and the park can be done in 1 if you get there first thing; also baring in mind the park is open until 10pm. But the additional day can be used on Disneysea"
1136,5,16-Sep,Australia,Big Kids,"Childhood dream to visit and we finally made it im our late twenties! Rides are so much fun its not just for kid's, make sure ypu dont miss out on space mountain its pretty trippy. "
1137,4,17-Jun,Singapore,Magical place,"As with all the Disney Parks, very entertaining. Tokyo version is very clean. However, more fun to go during Christmas season."
1138,4,17-Apr,Australia,Fun day,It was a fun day at disneyland. Feel like child again. My kids were had fun. It was good experince and we really enjoyed the varieties of popcorn hahaha. The food was lovely too. The place was very clean love it. It was busy but not too crowded. Had to be strategic with the fast pass. The water show at end of night was excellent. Only the fireworks was cancelled due to windy weather. But overall nice experiences for family.

1140,3,17-May,United States,I guess I was lucky...,"I visited Tokyo Disneyland on Sunday May 28, 2017. After reading the terrible and poor reviews (and listening to friends who previously visited), I expected the worst. So, I made sure I got an e-ticket ahead of time, wrote out a ""shopping list"" of rides I wanted to ride and got to the entrance to the Park (not the ticket booth since I had an e-ticket) at 6am. I would say that there were already 100+ people in line for an 8am opening (bring a book to pass the time away). Just before 8am, all the people who are staying at the Disney Resort got to go in first; it seemed like a 100+ people. So, I thought, shucks, all these 100 people are going to Pooh's Honey Hunt (PHH) and there will be a long wait. Well, when it was my turn to enter, I went straight to PHH, but it was temporarily closed due to mechanical problems. So I went straight to Splash Mountain and got a FP. After getting the FP, since the line was short, I stood in line. All in all, for being in the Park for 10 hours (I was away for 4 hours in the afternoon from 2-6pm to rest/shower in my hotel room which gave me energy for the evening), I got to ride PHH 3 times; Splash Mt 4 times; Pirates, Jungle Cruise, Haunted Mansion, Mark Twain, Western River Railway all one time. Get your flavored popcorn early because the lines get long. (I was wondering why all these kids were carrying these cute little character buckets (like Halloween. It's for the popcorn!) Hint: The only ride that allows for single riders is Splash Mt. Even if there are 4 of you, if you go as a single rider, you won't have to wait the 120 minutes. You may have to wait 20 minutes as single riders get on when a single rider is needed to fill a log. Highlights: the Electrical Parade (Baroque Hoedown brings back memories to Disneyland's Electrical Parade) and PHH. PHH is such a cute ride (especially for the young at heart). It's like being on a bumper car without getting hit. You go in all different directions. Wish the ride was longer, though, since you have to wait a long time to ride. Even the line for a FP was long. Because of the weather, Fireworks show was cancelled. Also, Autopia ride closed in January 2017 to make way for something else and Small World is being refurbished. And if you miss hearing the English language while in Japan, some of the rides are spoken in English. I was going to submit the following complaint to Guest Relations (but decided to ride more rides instead); when there's no one in the FP line for PHH, then let the people in the regular line go in. No, I had to wait because I guess so many FP people are let in at time and then just 5 regular people and then FP people again. Also, I was able to take my backpack on Splash Mt."
1141,5,17-Apr,Philippines,Where Dreams Do Come True!,"Amazing day with two teenagers on this trip with family.  It is cold and raining when we visited but did not hamper the child spirit within us all.  Most of the lines are super, super long... but we enjoyed every minute spent here.  Japanese are all so patient and quiet, and the line is just a breeze when we got to the attraction we are lining for.  The costumes of the group of teens walking around is also a sight to behold."
1142,2,17-May,Philippines,The worst Disneyland Ever!,"Space mountain & Small world were closed. There were no fireworks because it was cancelled. No free wifi inside. Everything was in Japanese (literally everything). I got lost buying my stupid magnet. I couldn't find my family inside so I went outside. I couldn't find them there so I decided to enter again (10pm). The pass that I had with me was a junior pass, maybe I interchanged with my nephews while trying to access Fast Pass. So they wouldn't let me in. I was getting furious because it's as if I can still do anything at 10pm there. I even showed them the magnet & receipt that I got to prove i was already inside. So I asked them to tell me where the nearest free wifi is because my wifi is with my husband who was with my family waiting inside. One of them accompanied me going to the free wifi spot near the train already. So I was able to get free wifi and called my husband. Indeed all 9 of them were inside waiting for me."
1143,5,17-May,N/A,The Magic that is Disney!,"We spent one day of our 3 day pass here and to be honest it was the right amount of time. We visited as a family of 4 ( 2 adults and 2 kids aged 10 & 7). We had prepurchased tickets which saved us a lot of time at the entry. There's a tram loop line that runs constantly between 4 stops ( Disney Sea, Disney Land, Metro/Train station & Tokyo Bay Hotels Stop). We used the tram loop line from our hotel (Sheraton Grande) and it was a 5 minute ride). We visited on a Wednesday and I was surprised at the size of the crowd. - Fast Passes- How do they work? Basically, each entry ticket is also your Fast Pass ticket. You can't purchase additional express tickets. On your Map, it will highlight which attractions offer Fast Pass entries. At the front of each attraction, there are FP scanners with a clock that shows you what the allocated return time is at that point in time. Once you've scanned, you are given a 30-40 minute window of time to return. Depending on how busy or popular a ride is, you may scan at 9:30 am and be told to return at 7pm! Be advised, once you have scanned your pass, you cannot obtain any other fast passes until your current FP allocated time expires. There are no limits as to how many FP passes you can have however you are limited due to the crowds and them selling out. - Take note on their website with regards to what rides will be closed during your visit. We missed out on Space Mountain which was an absolute shame :(- The rides at this park are quite tame and suitable for kids of ages 5+. Our favourites were Star Tours, Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain, Haunted Mansion, Mickeys PhillarMagic and the Tea Cups! - At around 4:30pm a huge wave of school kids appeared, not sure if these are locals with annual passes coming in for a quick ride however it added to the wait times. Average wait times were 30-90 minutes depending on the ride (splash mountain was the longest wait). - Some rides are very repetitive. These were mostly in the Fantasyland area. - We gave the night show a miss the first night which was a great opportunity to ride some of the rides as this alleviated wait times. - Definitely try a Mickey Waffle at the Great American Waffle Co! Amazing!!- We had lunch at the Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall. It was quite surreal inside and offered some whimsical desserts. They were fairly priced however, I did get sick from the swordfish here which resulted in us ending the night earlier than anticipated.All in all, a great visit and a memorable one for the kids. I would give it a miss if your kids or group are aged 15 or over as the rides are very tame and attractions not so elaborate! "
1144,5,17-May,India,Amazingly friendly staff and truly family friendly holiday,"The rides are all amazing and once you get the hang of getting fast passes, you can time it right, the parades and kiddo rides ensure there's something for all age groups ... if however you are looking for a bit of excitement go for their splash mountain "
1145,4,16-Sep,Philippines,Not the best,"I am a Filipino, and an English speaker. Felt bad that there was no English translation for the shows. The characters all speak Japanese. It's as if the park was really intended for the locals only. :( So yeah, not tourist-friendly."
1146,5,17-May,Malaysia,Dreamland,"Very busy place,do the shopping first then lunch wait till about 4pm to go on rides. When they show the parade in the middle of park big crowds watch that's the best time for lunch or rides that happens three times a day"
1147,1,17-May,Australia,QueueLand,"Everything is a queue, the fast pass is a joke that you have to laugh at.We got our Pooh's Honey Hunt ""fast pass"" at 8:50AM, and our time was 2:20PMWe got our Splash Mountain ""fast pass"" at 10:50 AM, and our time was 7:45PM! You can only get another ""fast pass"" every two hours.You get the idea..food options were terrible, and the queues for food were almost as bad as the rides. Avoid like the plague, if you don't like massive queues and massive crowds! I admit we went in school holidays, but nothing can make the day enjoyable, we got here an hour before opening. Finally..3 of the major rides were closed."
1148,5,17-May,N/A,Great place ,"We took our two young kids here and there was so much to do, we ended up staying the whole day and night. Very clean place and everyone was polite. The night parade at the end was amazing and our kids loved every minute of it."
1149,1,17-May,Philippines,"Dont go there, overcrowded to the max","Terrible experience wait 2 hours for every attraction! Then lunch time you wait for over an hour for chicken nuggets, to find out you cant get a seat! The food is horrible on top of that..... honestly i dont understand why people go here. Sat on the stage but got kicked off, so ate standing up.I reccomend you spare yourself and your kids from this horror!"
1150,4,17-Mar,Australia,Very interesting to visit this version of Disneyland,"I am a huge fan of Disneyland. I have loved visiting it ever since my parents took me (from Australia) when i was 9 years old, and i have been back quite a few times to the disney resorts on both sides of the states. So i was not sure what to expect  when i took the kids to this Tokyo one at the end of our family ski trip this year. I was not disappointed though - it was great. I loved that it was all in Japanese, so we couldn't actually understand anything. it made it fun. especially the jungle boat ride - that was hilarious. The lines were absolutely terrible it was taking nearly 3 hours to get on rides without a fast pass, so that part was bad. however, we did go on a Sunday and i would not recommend that to anyone else. The Japanese are so polite. Everyone is just great at lining up. They line up for everything. Popcorn... taking a photo... it is all extremely civilised. that part was really nice. The children had an absolutely amazing time, and we really enjoyed our visit, even with the long lines. "
1151,4,17-May,Australia,Disneyland - what can you say?,"It was extremely busy waiting lines were averaging 120 minutes and was hot.  But the kids had fun - that makes up for all the little problems like crowds, waiting lines etc etc."
1152,4,17-May,Australia,Good fun,"My friend and I (two girls in our mid-twenties) spent a full day at Disneyland and had a lot of fun! It's a tiring, jam-packed day with lots of queuing, but fun nonetheless. I'm not a big Disney fan so didn't know all of the characters, but the general feel of the place, plus the rides, attractions and parades makes it impossible not to have fun."
1153,5,17-May,Indonesia,What an amazing 2 days in Tokyo Disneyland,"Soooo much fun in the full 2 days we spent at Tokyo Disneyland. After months of preparation we were finally here and it even more amazing than we could ever imagine. Since we arrived in Tokyo Disneyland during their Easter Time, we had fun finding those cute eggs around the park and also laughing at Usatama naughtiness (their egg bunny character made especially for this year easter). the most memorable ride for my kiddos are the Pooh Hunt and  We managed to get Pooh Hunt Rides 2 times. One with the Fast Pass. Also got to ride Monster's Inc 2 times. We enjoyed our dinner at Queen of Hearts and Grandma's Sara. and dont forget to mention all those popcorn and the cuteness of popcorn buckets. i managed to grab 3 buckets to bring home hehehe... Such a sweet memory that will last forever in our hearts"
1154,5,17-Feb,N/A,Disneyland similar to hk but got a bit more attraction like toon town,same as the other disneyland in hk during this time lines were pretty long even for a weekday weather was great thou for feb month..food so so...typical burger fast food
1155,5,17-Feb,Malaysia,Truly a Magical Wonderland!,"Disneyland need no further introduction. It‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs dream to visit this magical wonderland. There are rides suitable for all ages.Tips:Super crowded park. Purchase your ticket online and get to the park earlier (1 hour before opening hours). The queue with pre-paid online tickets to enter the park for non-peak season is still overwhelming! Go there early!Get fastpass for popular rides. Check the queue time before getting the fastpass, if the queue time is short then it is not worth getting a fastpass for the ride. You can collect another fastpass even before using the previous fastpass, after a certain duration. Go read up some guides of the fastpass in the web.There are apps to check live ride queue times.For dinner in restaurants, make sure you prebook it to avoid disappointment! Mostly fully booked."
1156,2,17-Jan,Australia,Disappointing,"We went in January and knew to expect the crowds - the lines were probably half of what they could have been and they were hugh very crowded so would not like to see when it was crowded but that was not what was disappointing - I found the staff not as friendly and they were very regimented when trying to meet characters - my daughter got a ticket with her friend and I went up and stood with them to take my youngest - no one asked me if I wanted a ticket I had assumed I was on my daughters - after we waited in line and it was our turn I was not allowed to put my youngest in the picture because I did not have a ticket because my elder daughters ticket said two even though I had lined up and waited - then they only allow one person to take another photo so only my friend could take a picture I was ""shooed"" away it was bizzare - I understand waiting and process but in comparison you go to USJ in Osaka and OMG amazing service and a relaxed atmosphere where they encourage participation with the characters and overall much friendlier. Disneyland Hong Kong hands down much better than this one - from the staff to the rides and shows."
1157,4,17-May,Australia,Nice experience,"It was nice experience to visit Tokyo Disneyland. The attraction, parades various popcorn flavour, and staffs also friendly as well.Fast Pass is good idea to tried on to skip the long line.However, i reckon do not coming on Golden week (end of April till begin of May) because it is packed and you have to waiting in line for more than 1 hour to get a ride and the food in restaurant bit pricey though they only selling fast food. "
1158,3,17-May,Japan,Fun theme park but a little disappointed ,"This is my first time visited Tokyo Disneyland. Quite crowded and the queue line is long enough. Every restaurant is full, we need to wait at least 2 hour to get a table. But the attraction is so attractive and fun, and the souvenir was really cute. But for any traveler who visited this park, we need to pay attention to our belongings. Because if we want to enjoy an attraction or eat in the restaurant we need to parking our stroller out side, at first I tough it was amazing that everyone let their belongings stay in their stroller while they enjoying the attraction. So it means this themed park is safe from any lost or thief. But something bad happened to us, we lost our ergo baby carrier that we put in our stroller outside the restaurant, even though there is a waitress standing and waving for new customer near the stroller parking. But they can't say nothing about our complaint that we lost our stuff. Poor us. After eat we enter an attraction then parking out stroller ""again"" then ""again"" we lost our thing. This time is my daughter balloon. ‚òπÔ∏è so for any traveller, kept your belongings save by put your important things on your bag and carry them every where you go."
1159,5,17-Jan,United States,SO AWESOME,I would say this Japanese version is better than the one we have in America! Loved how the Japanese have their own spin on things. 
1160,3,17-May,United States,Beautiful and Clean Park,The park is beautiful and very clean. We're from Florida and aren't comparing it to Disney World. The problem we encountered with this park is that several attractions were closed. Space Mountain was undergoing refurbishment.  Small World was closed and many other areas were blocked off for refurbishment. The staff we encountered was very helpful and friendly. We hope we can return in the future when more attractions are operating.
1161,5,17-May,Australia,amazing,We loved Disneyland it was so lovely amazing. The only thing we didn't like is when the character came out they don't line up for them and everyone pushes their self or child onto the character and some the children are pushed away. The parades are great we loved watching them. Great night shows they are must to see. 
1162,5,17-Apr,United States,Best Disneyland overall.,"We have been to every Disney park in the world & Tokyo was clean, the staff efficient & the other guests polite & orderly. It was probably the most relaxed Disney visit of all considering we were there during Golden Week. We stayed at the Ambassador Hotel & the access to the park was easy & frequent. Unlike Disney World I actually didn't mind taking the bus to the park. Worth the visit, but Tokyo Sea kind of steals it's thunder. All the crazy popcorn flavours were fun to try!"
1163,4,17-May,Germany,A lot of Disney - no action rides ,"In general - a lot of Disney fun- get fastpass for popular rides (for free available next to the attraction)- soysauce and bitte flavored popcorn üçø - loads of funny dressed Japanese people- not a lot of touristsBe aware- food is very expensive in the park (ice-cream 320¬•) but you are allowed to bring food into the park My highlights - 4D starwars ride - mickeys Philharmony- 19:30 Electrical ParadeSkipable- ""Oh Minnie"" show including Latain Music was rather boring "
1164,3,17-Apr,N/A,Releasing the kid in you,A fun and entertaining park for children and bringing out the child in you. A very big and clean park compared to the 1 in HK. Only downside is the shows and parade all in Japanese. But still pleasant experience. Will want to visit Disney Sea next time.
1165,5,17-May,Singapore,Stay for the night shows,"Rides are easy but formulaic (Shooting arcade, roller coaster, animatronic), suitable for almost all ages. Great vibes from the staff who are absolute pros and visitors at the park, makes you feel that you're reliving your childhood. Please stay for the electrical parade with gleaming floats and the fireworks parade at 8:30pm."
1166,5,17-May,Bangladesh,Child's Paradise,This is for the kids as most of rides are for children. Adults would enjoy too! Rides are less scary. You have to study a bit before your trip so as to enjoy the most. Use fast passes to avail and enjoy maximum possible rides. Parades are must watch.
1167,4,17-Apr,N/A,ENCHANTED,"This is my fifth time in Tokyo Disneyland. And it is always a place that will bring out the child in everyone. I think Springtime is the best time to go to Tokyo.Better to check-in at one of their hotel to avail of their ""happy 15"". This will give you an advance 15 minutes to enter the park."
1168,5,17-May,United Kingdom,Great park ,"We spent 2 days in the park as well as 1.5 days at Disney seas and loved it. There's a great Disney atmosphere around the park just like the Florida one with all the same music and smells. All the rides are great and so are the parades.They use the old style of fast passes around the parks where you need to go to the ride to collect a fast pass ticket to return later. Which I think is better than the new system in Florida.So when you first enter the park it's best to go straight to the ride you want a FP for first then a short time later you can get another fast pass. It was fairly busy when we went but we still got on everything. I can see why people get a FP for the Winnie the pooh ride as Well, it's a lovely ride and well done. Again all the food was delicious, the honey and curry popcorn is worth trying, didn't like the soy sauce one much though as it was just like salty popcorn! We ate at the Queen of hearts restaurant which was very nice and was about ¬£28 for a drink, two mains, a dessert and a kids meal set. Also the pizza in the Toy town area is very scrummy and the cakes from the bakery.The only thing that disappointed us were the fireworks. We we sat waiting for them a 3 mins before they cancelled them due to bad weather, it was a lovely night with no rain or wind. They also did this the next night and when they did do the fireworks on our last night we watched from our hotel balcony as we were packing and you couldn't see them properly due to the thick cloud and it had been raining all day, so no idea what happened There! The electrical parade was very Good, much better than the one that was in Florida. There is quite a bit of merchandise but as they are not Disney owned your find more in the official Disney store in the down town area and they had a huge sale on. "
1169,4,17-May,Indonesia,Nice and fun,"Disneyland has a very good method of fastpass. We do not have to pay extra unlike Universal. And it really saves us a lot of time. It is packed with visitors but the waiting time for each ride is quite reasonable. We still can enjoy the park and rides.Overall, it is a very nice experience especially the eletrical light show. It was so beautiful and nice."
1170,4,17-May,United States,A nice Disney excursion,"We have taken our kids multiple times to DL Anaheim and Disney World. This is our 1st family visit to Tokyo Disney.  I was so happy to visit here.  The Japanese visitors set a wonderful example of how to behave. They sit down patiently, weather permitting, awaiting the park doors to open. They do not push, shove or toss food on the floor and rarely eat in line. They speak softly and politely. It's the visitors speaking in Korean or Mandarin who I find are more obnoxious in line or at restaurants. It's the cleanest Disney park I've seen and they have popcorn trucks everywhere. In the US, popcorn would be strewn all over the place.  No dirty paper towels on bathroom floors, cigarette butts or gum and sticky drinks stuck on the pavement. Makes for a much happier experience. We let our adult kids navigate and because Space Mountain and Small World were both closed, we were able to see everything we wanted to see. The food trucks have unique items. We liked the hot, sweet potato tipa torta Y3.60 the best. Long sticks resembling churro with a sweet pasty center. Crunchy on the outside. We didn't like the chocolate one.  We didn't like the melon churro either.  Consistent with DL pricing, a lot of the food is overpriced with small portions. We tried the cinnamon churro rolled so when you look at a cross section, resembles a Mickey head. Very gimmicky and was hard and dried out. My 2 funniest experiences here was when the doors opened and people were running to the rides. I was laughing so hard as we don't see that in DL Anaheim often. One 5-7 yr old fell and picked himself up and kept running. Staff members everywhere holding signs advising not to run.  Another time, 2 young ladies behind us were talking softly, laughing and taking pictures in line. On the ride, they started building momentum with sounds that contestants make on Japanese game shows per my kids, then the girls would scream on the ride. I couldn't stop laughing.  It's like watching a reserved person suddenly let loose and go wild in Disneyland. The rides are fairly identical to the Anaheim DL with some variations. Poohs Hunny Hunt was very cute.  I thought Pirates of the Caribbean and Haunted House were darker rides due to lighting. Voyage of Simbad was cute with nice music and singing of the song, Compass of Your Heart, by K. Sakamoto.  The ride is similar to It's a Sm World.   The place is very large and spacious not congested like at DL. My kid liked this DL the best. I enjoyed the different types of food offerings, even if some are hit or miss, and really liked the civility of the Japanese. The last ride of the day, we were on the Jungle Cruise. I saw one of the Disney managers chatting with staff in his suit with name tag on. Later, he removed his tag, climbed into the boat and observed the staff at work while riding with us. At the end of the ride, he stayed behind, replaced his tag and chatted with staff. I've never seen suits at DL Anaheim visit with staff to either check in, make observation visits or hang to talk to staff and this was 9:45 PM.  Maybe DL parks in the US would run better if managers took a more hands on approach to get feedback from front line staff.   "
1171,5,17-May,Australia,Dreams Do Come True,"Wow, this place is the best. From the moment you step off the monorail till you leave you are greeted with smiling faces. The staff were unbelievable and courteous."
1172,5,17-May,Philippines,Best place for kids!,"Some tips for FP(Fast Pass) ticket!!1. Get FP ticket of Monsters Inc. first because it is located right after the main entrance and it is occupied really quickly.2. Download TDR wait time check application from Google Store. It gives you the information of waiting time and the map.3. Note that you must wait for 2 hrs to take next FP ticket since it needs ""cool down"" time"
1173,5,17-May,Canada,Always fun at Disney ,"In Tokyo for a few days before our return to NA we decided to go to Disney. We r fans, we did all the parks in USA & Paris. It's easy to locate, 40 minutes by train, clean and awesome. They always have great ride, great food and Awesome FIREWORKS....It's a must G"
1174,3,17-May,Australia,Pretty much the same as California's park,"If your a first or maybe second time Disney visitor Tokyo Disney is probably still worth going to, having Disney Sea next to Disneyland is a big plus as nearly all the better rides are in Disney Sea. If you only had one choice of park I'd pick Disneyland for the younger children and Disney Sea for the older children."
1175,4,17-Mar,Singapore,An Experience that you must get!!.,"1) Start your day early. 2) I bought my tickets from Singapore, so i did not have to wait in the already long queue that was present there when i arrived @ 0800hrs. 3) My mistake was that i did not buy the express pass. If you are not a local, BUY the express pass, you will save alot of time and energy. I had  to wait an average of 40-80mins for each attraction in queue while those with express passes were just ""Zooming"" through. 4) If you are going there with young kids, pack some light food (sandwiches, mineral water, etc..) The queue for buying food and water is equally long. Plan your route early. They have lots of shows at specific time, so do identify the ones that you wanna go and be there early. 5) Make sure to take all rides and i'm pretty sure your kids and adults alike will have a wonderful and magical experience. 6) Allocate an entire day for this outing. I was there from 0800hrs till 1900hrs."
1176,5,17-Mar,United States,The flowers were beautiful and the park was fun!,"Plan your visit carefully. Lines can be really long, so run to the one you want most and get fast passes right away, then stand in a line you care a little less about."
1177,4,17-Apr,United Kingdom,Disney Day Out,"An enjoyable day out, and something different after exploring Tokyo for a few days.Very similar in terms of attractions to Disneyland California - except much more space at Tokyo Disneyland. No barging into people and feeling cramped.We spent the full day there, making use of the Good Neighbour Hotels shuttle bus from our hotel in Daiba. Unfortunately the fireworks were cancelled due to 'weather' (not sure what weather, maybe it was too cloudy?) but we watched the parade, then made use of the no queues to go on Space mountain twice in a row in the space of ten minutes while people were watching the projection mappings on the castle.A good day out for all ages, and cheaper than any other Disney park as well! (ticket was ¬£50/ 7500Yen/ $65)"
1178,4,17-Apr,Australia,Good fun for all ages,"A must do in Tokyo, a day where adults can be kids without judgement! We had a fantastic time although you will queue up for hours at some of the major rides. Be sure to make use of the fast pass machines if you make it in early enough! Also, a lot of the rides are in Japanese only so if you don't speak the language you'll have to wing it like we did haha"
1179,5,17-May,Indonesia,"Just incredible, beautiful and is a 'MUST VISIT'.","I really had a very great time here. The staff are very kind and helpful. The parade is just as brilliant as it is. If you're going to ride some attractions here, you can skip the line by getting yourself a fastpass ticket. I really had a great time meeting my Disney friends like Mickey, Minnie and many other Disney characters."
1180,5,17-Apr,Philippines,a MUST-GO Disney park,"This Disney park is a beautiful version of the usual Disneypark with the Cinderella's castle in the middle. If you have been to Disneyland in Anaheim and Hongkong, it will seem familiar yet interestingly different at the same time. The crowds can get big but waiting for rides will be worth it. I love their special popcorn buckets  and browsing through their shops with interesting stuff can easily take much of your time. While the crowds can get big, Japanese are very polite and considerate that it never gets too busy or rowdy. "
1181,5,17-Apr,Australia,Amazing day,"It's easy to see why Disneyland is called ""the happiest place on earth"". Everything is considered from constant music going, to food throughout and of course the rides and characters. The most amazing part was the attitude of the staff who were so pleased to see each and every kid. We had a ball. Expect cue's for rides and expensive food, but it's an awesome day out the kids will remind you of forever... and not bad for the adults either!! "
1182,5,16-Jun,China,The best Disneyland in the world...and definitely the cleanest I have visited!,"This Disneyland really felt like a dream...the visit was close to perfect! The good: large and spacious park, clean, polite staff, doable in one day (if you are quick!)-I really have to commend the cleanliness...I couldn't even see a single speck of dust on the parade route!-Highly suggest watching the Minnie Oh Minnie show (you may think it's for young children, but it is actually VERY entertaining and has lots of latin music)-One Man's Dream is great too (when I went there was no lottery so that was even better)-the explorer canoes are great for those who want to see the critter country lake faster (although it gets tiring paddling for so long)-highly suggest going to Toontown as well (there are things for adults to do too!)-You MUST DEFINITELY watch the ""Once Upon A Time"" fireworks. It will really ""ignite the dream in your heart"", and the accompanying music still has me singing a year from the visit. Another amazing area is the Bazaar. If you need gifts and souvenirs, you will go NUTS when you see the things on offer. I suggest spending at LEAST one hour in the shops because there are so many cute things to buy. The prices are a little expensive though.I couldn't really think of anything bad, except maybe the lines for some rides (I did not even attempt lining up for some like Winnie the Pooh because the line wait was like 50 minutes)"
1183,4,16-Jun,Bahrain,Very charming but needs more thrills,"I went to Disneyland in October 2013 with my friends and I enjoyed my time there. The staff at both Disneyland and Disneysea are probably the nicest and most polite you will ever meet in a theme park which is very common in Japan. The ride I was looking forward to the most was the Winnie the Pooh's ride which was closed for maintenance. The Flume ride and the ghost mansion were amazing; however, the grizzly mountain roller coaster and the space mountain were a bit lackluster compared to their counterparts in Hong Kong Disneyland and they needed more thrills added into them. Overall, it was an amazing experience but if you are out of time and can only visit one of Tokyo's Disney Parks, go for Disneysea. Also, plan well and go EARLY!!!!"
1184,5,17-May,Singapore,A must do!,"Coming to Tokyo Disneyland is one of the highlight of my JAPAN trip. This is the first Disneyland I have visited and yes, long queue for each attraction. But surprisingly as an impatient person, I was able to patiently wait for around an hour for a ride. I read a lot about fastpass before my visit but as I arrive at 12pm, I did not manage to get any. Well it's not the end of the world though! In fact I find the rides I done was far from memorable as the daytime parade, electric parade, firework and Cinderella castle light show. Dining at the queens banquet was amazing too and we managed to avoid the crowd by having dinner at 4.30pm. The queue was twice as long when we left! Winnie the Pooh ride was a WOW ending to my visit (the queue was still long even at 9pm) as it really amazed me how they designed the routes for the electric cars. To end with, please do visit Tokyo Disneyland and spend more days if you can!"
1185,3,17-Apr,Singapore,Another day at Disneyland.,"Tokyo Disneyland is a 5 mins walk from the Maihama train station. There are numerous rides here with the better rides being those with the Fastpass. The better few attractions in my opinion are the Winnie the Pooh, haunted mansion (cool computer graphics and lightings) and the Buzz lightyear. Food option were nothing spectacular, and the queues were all very long. Plan things to do while waiting in line for your turn."
1186,4,17-May,Australia,Crowded and a tad disappointing,"It is necessary to arrive early and line up in order to beat the crowds. Having visited Disneyland in both the US and Hong Kong, I found Tokyo Disneyland to be much the muchness. Lines for rides were ridiculous with wait times up to two hours, so a fast pass is a must. The most intriguing part of the visit was observing the Disney outfits worn by visitors to the park. Bought the three day pass but only spent one day here. Tip: it is cheaper to purchase from the Disney shop at Maihama Station than to purchase in the park."
1187,4,17-May,Australia,Great place for all ages but long queues ,Visited with my kids aged 5 & 7. We had 3 day passport but still we couldn't finish Disneyland rides as average waiting time is around 30-40 minutes and on few big rides is 80 minutes.Suggest that one should go and take fast pass on the post famous rides as they are marked on the map. Remember to carry a jacket for sure and don't wear summer clothes as it gets really windy there and a jacket and jeans is must.Loved it but had to have lots of patience to wait to get on the rides.
1188,4,17-May,United States,Full of originality but remain traditional Disney theme,"Its fun, signature parade in Spring was Easter parade- funny enough, it sounded like performing till mid June. I assume people don't know much about Easter concept. Anyway, the on-going parade was all about bunnies and eggs called Usatama. The story was the bunny like eggs, Usatama were running away, Mickey and friends were trying to capture them. The parade song was half Japanese and half English. Costume, dance and parade itself was full of originality and very interesting that visitors could enjoy the uniqueness of Tokyo Disney Land.However, most of the attraction was solely operated in Japanese. I personally wondered if they should hire more casts who can speak multiple languages or install some subtitle board displayed English and more languages electronically for non Japanese speakers at each ride or show.Other than language barrier, they have offered unique food, interesting snack and fun and collectible souvenirs that we can't find in the US."
1189,5,17-Apr,New Zealand,Great Disney experience,"This was my first trip to a disneyland and the size and scale of ecerything took some getting used to. Huge amount of people but in true Japanese style, its ordered chaos and you dont feel over crowded and everyone is respectful.The park is huge and we didnt really understand the fast pass system at first but went in an anticlockwise direction from opening and we seemed to walk into each attraction with minimal wait times. I enjoyed the ""Star Tours"" attraction the most as we didnt know what we walked into and although it was all in Japanese it was still fun. Not sure what the hype is about the Winnie the Pooh ride is as it was the most boring for us, over all the rides here are not thrill rides. The fast passes have an hour or so wait time on them, so once you get one for a ride you cant grab one for a different ride straight away. We also didnt realise the lines at the front gate were to get in, not actually purchase the tickets, so if you are buying at the park, look for the ticket booths (in between the massive lines waiting to get in).Other than that, explore the park and enjoy the night light parade, its amazing."
1190,5,17-Apr,United States,Friendliest place on Earth,"After having visited all the Disney parks, I have to say this would be my reccomendation if you could only visit one park outside the US, make it this one.  Tokyo Disney and DisneySea are the friendliest parks out there.  The Cast Members are friendly, helpful, and willing to go out of their way to help you. They are always smiling, the park was always clean, most people ( not Americans) dressed up for their visit to the park, so it was a great atmosphere.   It was sad to see so many big ticket rides closed at once - We were unable to ride Pirates, Winnie the Pooh or Small World due to closures.  But over all we had an amazing time, well worth a visit. "
1191,4,17-Apr,N/A,Great nostalgia hit and beautiful Nighttime parade,"First time to Disneyland and it was a long but worthwhile day. I went as an adult with a group of adult friends, but we all enjoyed reliving our childhood and having fun. Food was more reasonably priced than I expected too! If you can make it out the whole day, DEFINITELY stay for the final electric parade. The floats are incredible!Unfortunately, some rides were also closed during April 2017. Check online before planning the trip. We were a little disappointed by this. I took as much advice from online as possible: - go early - go on a weekday - try not to catch school holidaysIt turned out wise to follow this advice. Still, by lunch time you should be expecting to wait in lines for a while.If you are going with your friends as an adult, realise that the rides aren't going to blow you away. The best picks when we went were Big Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, and Astro Blasters."
1192,5,16-Nov,New Zealand,Feel like a child again!,A fantastic Disney park! The customer service really doesn't need a mention as the Japanese have this naturally at the best level possible! Easy to get to by train but check the crowd calendar as this park does get extremely busy! Loved the experience and we will return upon our next visit to Tokyo!
1193,4,17-Apr,United Arab Emirates,Bursts of Magic & Fun,A happy family visit which lasted 8 hours with great rides and enjoyable meals. The park was not packed but that still meant queuing for 10 minutes in some cases and 2 hours in others. The relatively short rides in between were bursts of magic and fun. Our boat ride through the jungle was particularly enjoyable with our most dynamic and engaging guide. The fast track option at the park was not clear. An App indicating attractions' queuing times would be great.
1194,4,17-Apr,United States,Not so impressive if you've been to other Disney parks,"While I loved my experience at this park, I have to say that I wasn't as impressed compared to when I visited the DIsney World  Orlando parks. The rides are all nearly the same and the park is a tad bit smaller. Great for kids and adults, however did not see any alcohol being sold."
1195,5,16-Dec,United States,Another Great Disney Park,"Simply another great Disney park. Very similar to the other Disney parks, but the fact that it is located on Tokyo Bay and the customer service by the Japanese is second to none, makes this particular park a must visit. Make sure you pay attention to the crowd calendar for this park because it stays pretty busy. Definitely worth the visit though.  "
1196,4,17-Apr,Bahrain,Nice for the family,I viaited the park with my wife and noticed how small it is comparing to Disneyland in Orlando .. queues here are extremely long and you MUST buy a fast track ticket .. overall its good but small with not good food
1197,5,17-Jan,N/A,Kids paradise,We visited this place with a group of kids and our friends.  We had such a good time here and I can recommend everyone to bring your kids and have a good time here
1198,4,17-Apr,N/A,A great place for families,"My husband and I recently visited Tokyo Disneyland and had a great day. The ride system was good with the 'FastPass', however no one told us about this and we only managed to figure it out half way through our day. It would be great if there was clearer information before entering the park. Many of the rides were suitable for children and the clear focus is on child rides. Some of the rides we went on had no english. This is understandable and expected, however it would be good if this was made clear before going into the ride/show. We still enjoyed the shows and had a great day.The food is good and not too expensive (considering the location and attraction)."
1199,5,17-Mar,United States,Amazing park with great retro feel,"Tokyo Disneyland was easily my second favorite of all of the Disney parks in the world (impossible to beat the original in California).  Very clean, rides were well maintained, food was good and not as expensive as expected.  A number of rides and experiences were spoken only in Japanese, which added to the fun - especially the Jungle Cruise.  Ticket prices were also significantly cheaper than the US parks.  I"
1200,4,17-Apr,N/A,Awesome rides,Loved the rides - but takes planning Suggest getting toy story ride express ticket first up Then rush to line up rides of your choice The night parade and sound/light shows are also great
1201,5,17-Apr,Malaysia,"Very clean, colourful and fun park",Friendly and helpful cast members.Park is extremely clean. Colours are very bright and cheerful. Rides are well maintained. Totally worth it!
1202,4,17-Apr,United States,"It's Disney, you know what you're getting","Great fun at a well run, clean park. The kids loved all of the rides and the lines weren't nearly as bad as they could have been. We were there during the second week in April, which may be a small sweet spot for lesser crowds. The parades were cool, especially the light parade. Tried most of the popcorns, liked them all especially the soy sauce and butter.If you're a Disney fan, you have to go."
1203,5,17-Apr,N/A,First timer,Took my family to Tokyo for a week and we made the park there final 2 day ending and must say it was wonderful. You can't come into this Disney park thinking it's like all the rest cause I'm guessing you will sadly be disappointed. Yet they hold there own an sure 98% of the workers and rides are Japanese but i promise you if you open your minds an follow the motions you will be fine plus just point to what you want if you can they understand.  
1204,5,17-Apr,Australia,"Amazing, great for kids from young kids to teens","We loved it. I am not a Disney fan but I loved it. The highlights were the boat safari ride, country train ride and haunted house ride and the electric light float parade was amazing. Wear good shoes, be patient and expect cues and you will love it."
1205,5,16-Dec,United States,Magical Place!,Loved all the kid friendly rides for our 5 year old!There were some rides I was a bit bumped she couldn't ride due to height restrictions but overall loved all the rides! We could stay here for 2 days!
1206,3,17-Apr,United States,Beautiful but not Disneyland or Magic Kingdom,"If you live in LA like I do, and if you go to Disneyland (or Magic Kingdom for those of you who live on the East Coast) frequently as I do, then you might be disappointed.  Tokyo Disneyland is nice and clean, just like you'd expect and Disney attraction to be; however, it's smaller and has less rides.  It's also super crowded.  If you've never had an opportunity to visit Disneyland or Magic Kingdom, I'd definitely go.  However, this is probably one of those places I could have skipped.  We went because of our teenage kids.  They liked it, but they both said they preferred ""our"" Disneyland."
1207,4,17-Apr,N/A,Great visit but very crowded,"You need to plan to pick the right day to come here, we landed here on a Thursday and Japanese spring break had just started and it was packed, had to wait for couple for hours for each ride. But it is nice to be out in the park our 8 yr old daughter loved the experience being in the park. Good fun not to be missed."
1208,3,17-Apr,United Kingdom,Ok but very long lines,"I had very high expectations but really it was just ok. By the time we got there the only fast pass we could get was for after 7pm so we were reconciled to queuing for a few rides. We went on Monsters Inc, the Pooh Hunny ride (which was really good and worth the 40 minute wait), the Star Wars ride (might be oldish but still good) and the spinning teacups. That's all we had the energy to queue for. We were disappointed that two rides were closed (Pirates and small world). We mostly enjoyed watching the people who really do throw  themselves  into the whole experience. I thought the food was reasonably priced compared to other parks we've visited (e.g. About ¬£3.50 for a very generously sized Micky waffle with cream and sauces).  All in all a nice day out but not as great as I'd hoped. "
1209,5,16-Nov,Thailand,Disney's never been disappointed,The safety is excellent. Clean and calm if you want. Fun and amusement if you like. Worth every YEN paid. Also with the enthusiasium of Japanese here makes it more interesting. Lovely and Funny.
1210,5,16-Jul,Denmark,Great day at a great place,"We went there early when they opened and stayed until the park closed. The weather was perfect and very hot. The first thing we experienced was a very beautiful Disney-parade with everything Disney and on top of this water... lots of water, which the actors and dancers shot out over the croud... epic. Afterwards we went on to try all the rides (unfortunately Space Mountain was closed for repairs), but Star Tours had been updated since last time I visited Disneyland in Paris, so we tried it 7 times in a row... that's how great it was. All the rides were just pure fun, just as we're used to and we just continued until late evening until we had to leave. The different restaurants around the park are also very nice, although they could be a little crowded, but what else could one expect?!In the evening before leaving the park we went shopping for all kinds of Disney-stuff and to top off an excellent day we enjoyed the incredibly beautiful evening parade.If you haven't experienced Disneyland Tokyo it's really about time you do."
1211,4,17-Apr,United States,Disneyland Tokyo,"Great time at Disneyland Tokyo.  Best to arrive early and take advantage of fast past for favorite rides.  Some rides were over an hour wait.  Currently, the It's a Small World ride is under renovation and won't reopen until 2018.  "
1212,5,17-Apr,United Kingdom,It was raining almost whole day but still enjoyable!,"I believe Tokyo Disneyland is the best Disneyland in the world (probably just behind Florida's Disney World).We didn't have a good weather when we were there because it was almost raining non-stop from 8am until 6pm. However, the rain did not stop many at least us to go and enjoy here. The experience was awesome.Few tips:- Buy the ticket from Disneystore in the city- If you have the budget, stay at the Disney resort hotel and visit both Disneyland & sea.- Try the food here, is awesome! The buffet is great too. I heard avoid the western food.- Get the popcorn basket deal- Plan properly for the attractions you want to play and get the fast pass. Recommend rides are Splash Mountain.- Don't miss the electric parade, fireworks and the final show at the castle. Make sure you get there early to secure a spot in front of castle at least 30 minutes before the fireworks, so you can watch the final show from the front line. It is awesome!"
1213,4,17-Apr,Switzerland,Very clean and professional set-up,"It is amazing how tens of thousands of people can be in one place without it being too chaotic and remains spotless clean. Everybody seems to enjoy themselves and live the ""Disney dream"". For me, there are too many people and too long lines for the attractions. Anyhow, I accept I am not the right target group. The kids loved it, and that was the aim of the trip to Tokyo Disneyland"
1214,5,17-Apr,United Arab Emirates,Awesome day!,Took the 2 boys (9&5) for the day. Had an amazing time. Yes there were a lot of people even on a school day (20 adults for every child) and the queues were relatively long (averaged about an hour) but if you go knowing you will have to wait then you will have a great day. First thing to do is get an express pass for one of the big rides and then enjoy some other ones until it's your time. We visited Universal in Osaka a few days later and the kids much preferred the Disney experience. 
1215,5,17-Apr,Japan,"For the disabled,  TIPS N HINTS!!","Well I'm partly disabled. I can't stand for long periods so waiting in line is out of the question. So here's how to get around Disneyland in comfort. Head straight to your right once entering DL. Look for a house with PINK circular walls just under the roof. There you can hire normal wheelchair, baby carts, electric 4 wheeled scooter. This scooter you sit in and turn the throttle to move, it's ¬•2000 a day. Batteries work great. Now!!! you have to plan ahead on what you want to do, see and ride. There are passes called FAST PASS. Google n check what they are. So pick one of the main rides you want to do. And use fast pass for that. NOW YOU HAVE AN electric scooter, this entitles you to receive a SPECIAL GUEST PASS. It works be same way the FAST PASS does. So now go to the second ride you REALLY want to do and use your SPECIAL PASS. Now once this is done there will be a wait till your ride times come up. So this is a great way to do the rides, shows etc that take 20- 40 mins per wait. BUT these and all rides etc you can't take the scooter in the line.  You will have to stand. But if you can't stand for more than an hour without a break I feel Disney will be a struggle in this instance. ( 20-40min wait). Also please be patient while on the scooter. You will have many people not looking where they are going and get in your road while driving around. "
1216,5,17-Apr,Australia,Enjoyed every minute,I never thought I would have had as much fun as I did. Being a male in my early 30 I didn't think DisneyLand would really appeal to me or be that enjoyable. I took my 6 year old daughter who had the best time as did i. I thoroughly enjoy the day and would go back in a heart beat. If you are able to include the nighttime parade in your schedule it is a must.... one of the most enjoyable aspects of the visit. Some of the rides are a little scary so be careful when taking your little ones on them. I learnt the hard way that the rides I thought would be fun were in fact scary. Overall a great day out and would recommend to everyone 
1217,4,17-Apr,France,Tokyo Disneyland ,"Awesome park to go with kids, went there from 9 am till end of last parade.The only disappointing thing is the long wait ... for each attraction.We waited at least 20 to 40 mn - we did 3 attractions only. "
1218,2,17-Apr,Australia,Avoid school holidays - and arrive early,"We arrived 2 hours after the park opened and the wait times for the marquee rides were already over 3 hours, with fast passes only available for night time (I.e. 7:30pm). There were massive lines for everything, including toilets and food. My advice; arrive early and take your own food. On the positive side it is better than the Anaheim original park, but busier."
1219,2,17-Apr,N/A,Only for families with kids under 10 years of age!,"This is a stroller nightmare with attractions that amuses only die-hard Disney fans or very small children. If you include shopaholic to this, you have found heaven. If you don¬¥t arrive with a child in a stroller, love to queue up for hours or spend money on crappy food and Disney merchandise, stare at paint drying for better fun!"
1220,5,17-Apr,Myanmar,WOW,This is my third time at Tokyo Disneyland and I went there with my family. It was really fun and I had so much fun there. My favorite ride was the Space mountain and Splash mountain. They had varieties of popcorn flavors and some of them are really unique. The parades were excellent and the fireworks were just really pretty and amazing. Tokyo Disneyland is one of my favorite places on Earth.
1221,5,16-May,Malaysia,Perfect performance,"The oldest Disneyland outside US opened more than 30 years ago. It is really amazing that the park being very well maintained and kept up-to-date for the steep competition with other parks around the world. We went there on Friday to avoid the crowd which was a good strategy, the weather was very good that all the outdoor activities were also very enjoyable. The night performance was another highlight that one should not miss. Planning the rides with fast pass was another good strategy, with that we managed to take most of the rides within one day visit. Our kids really enjoy the rides and all the performances which we can always feel their passion. The friendly park assistants were always around with smiling face to guide and assist. The park was always kept in very clean condition that everyone can simply sit on any part of the ground. Thumb up and recommend for all the visitor with young children."
1222,5,17-Apr,Malaysia,A.M.A.Z.I.N.G,"Having been to the Paris version I was expecting more of the same - Busy - Massive lines, looking a little tired. I could not be more wrong if I tried. Don't get me wrong, Disneyland is the land of the line but the order, cleanliness and thee upkeep of tokyo disney is outstanding. They are clearly starting to close down parts of tomorrowland and when we went the Pooh Bear, small world and pirate's of the Caribbean rides were closed.We still loved it -certainly loved the 4D star tours rode."
1223,5,17-Apr,Philippines,Always a magical time,"Hands-down the best in Asia -- right park size, variety of rides for young children, least greasy food (expensive yes, but you can enjoy eating at any restaurant here), added with the Japanese orderliness, cleanliness and performance technical expertise, our family is truly in the happiest place on earth.Book your tickets online to get in faster. Bring a mat to watch the parade (everyone's expected to sit on the floor without any head gear). One Man's Dream is a must-watch show. If you're a ""It's A Small World"" fan, best to come on May 2018 as the ride is under renovation. With little kids, maybe better to go after lunch to last until fireworks at 850pm. "
1224,5,16-Sep,United States,Flawless and Unique,"I've been to all of Disney's US properties - this was my first time visiting one of the international locations.  I went with a group of three friends - all serious Disney enthusiasts.  We loved every minute!  The attractions are exciting and different, the park is spotless and top-notch and the staff was wonderful.  There are definitely things that ""cater"" to the Japanese and Asian guests, but we found this charming.  I highly recommend it and would go back in a second, even though we saw literally everything."
1225,5,17-Mar,United States,EXCELLENT ATTRACTION,"My family consisting me, my wife and two teenage daughters went to Disneyland for two days in March.  We took a taxi from our hotel to get there.  The first days it was raining and cold but we had warm waterproof jackets so were fine.  There were many people there as it was Spring Break vacation for students.  It was very fun and exciting.  It was extremely clean and very organized.  At one point I asked an employee where the toilet was and they actually walked to me the toilet.  It was a bit expensive but very much fun."
1226,5,17-Mar,Australia,Memories that will last forever,I went to Disneyland as a 10 year old and Disneyland Tokyo was just as fantastic. We only went for 1 day and it was a little hectic with a lines and we missed a few rides but if we went again I would do it over 2 days just to make it more relaxing but you can do it over 1 if you get the fast passes. The night show is a must! 
1227,3,16-Dec,Australia,Nowhere near as good as Paris or US Disneyland! No Thrill!,"As a 25 year old who absolutely loves Disneyland having been to Disneyland in Paris and Anaheim, I was completely disappointed with Tokyo Disneyland.The rides seem to run at 50-75% of thrill compared to the other Disneylands. The wait times are also ridiculous! I admit we were there on Christmas Day which is apparently couples day, but in some cases the wait was 300 minutes! 5 HOURS FOR A RIDE?!?! (Moreso a ride that isn't even thrilling!!!!). Fast passes also disappear within the first hour of opening. For my friends who has never been to Disneyland, they really enjoyed it but also admitted that the rides weren't that thrilling. For those of us who had been to a Disneyland before we all agreed it wasn't nearly as fun or worth it!"
1228,5,17-Apr,N/A,Perfect üëå üëåüëåüëå,"We spend the whole day on 9th April there. It was amazing for the kids, when it will not be raining, will be more comfortable, but anyway perfect day üòâ with lots of fun üé°üé¢üé†üè∞"
1229,5,16-May,Thailand,Overflowing happiness,"If you are visiting Tokyo, don't miss the Disneyland. It's a happy place for everyone! Staff are nice, rides are awesome!"
1230,5,17-Mar,Australia,Happiest Place on Earth ,"My Mum and sister spent the day at Tokyo Disneyland at the end of March, we had the most amazing day, you'll love it I'm sure when you go! We wore our Mickey Mouse ears all day and visited every section of the park. Our lunch at the Queen of Hearts was delicious and you get to keep the little dessert plates as souvenirs - they're so cute! We went on the train and the teacup ride which was fantastic. We had photos with 3 Disney characters also. The snack carts are all around and we loved the sweet cream cheese pretzel. The flowers everywhere are so beautiful and the park had its Easter theme through which was lovely. The night electronic lights parade was spectacular and beautiful, as was the fireworks afterwards. I enjoyed Tokyo Disneyland more than the original one in Anaheim. A must see for all ages, you won't be disappointed."
1231,5,17-Jan,Australia,Amazing experience,"A must visit for family!!! However to avoid long lines, try visit during weekdays. Went there on Friday, it was long line in every games. For food try the churros and turkey. Its delicious!!! Itsa place where yr disney dream come alive!!!"
1232,4,16-May,N/A,Wanna Visit one more place,"Most of allClean and comfortable booking system.Because of Every 2 hour booking system, We used attraction and bought many gift.If I go to Disney again I will choose a avoiding weekend because of visiting to so many people."
1233,5,17-Feb,China,A lovely place for kids and adults!,"It was the last Saturday on February, we arrived there at 12pm, already too many people, all the rides were sooo long queue... there was 3 different parade shows during the days, so, at least we could enjoy the parades.Remember, don't go there during the Japan school holiday and weekend!"
1234,3,16-Nov,Australia,Lovely place but just so busy!,Don't get me wrong its a beautiful Disneyland but every ride there was such a long wait. The Japanese hospitality was as per usual amazing but the crowds were just too much to be able to enjoy it completely and we were there on a Monday!
1235,5,17-Apr,Australia,A magical end to our holiday!,"Having been to Disney World Orlando, Disneyland California, Disneyland Paris and Disneyland Hong Kong we were determined to finish our two week tour of Japan at Disneyland Tokyo. As we were there on April 6th, which is school holidays and cherry blossom festival for Japan we knew it would be ultra busy but we were pleasantly surprised that we managed to do so many rides. We decided we would not go on anything with a queue longer than 40 minutes but were fortunate that most only had 20 minute waits we did - Pinocchio, Snow White, Peter Pan, Haunted House, Splash Mountain, Canoes, Spinning Cups, Star Tours, Railroad and Swiss Family Tree House. We avoided Space Mountain, Buzz, and Thunder Mountain as the queues were well over an hour. We did Country Bear Jamboree, Minnie Oh Minnie, Enchanted Tiki Birds and we watched the Easter Parade ‚ÄúUsatama on the Run!"" and the Electric Parade. We had an absolutely wonderful day and left just after 8pm as we had a 6.30 am pick up the following morning. The journey from our Hotel Metropolitan in Ikebukuro took approx 1 hour on the circle line and the Keio line and was very easy to follow.As we love The Crystal Palace restaurant in Orlando we decided to eat there in Tokyo and we were not disappointed - see review."
1236,4,17-Apr,United States,Busiest Disney in the world,"We arrived in April and it must have coincided with school holidays in Japan. Crowds were present from the opening time to the closing time. Standby lines for the popular rides went over an hour to two or more within an hour of opening. We booked 4 days so that we could do Disney Sea and Disneyland 2 days each. My kids are 8 and 11 so they are not interested in the smaller kids rides (i.e. fantasyland, toon town rides). So we spent our time at space mountain, thunder mountain railroad, splash mountain, the haunted mansion, monsters inc, and we caught a number of shows. I think that when standby lines get over 2 hours, it substantially reduces the experience for Disney guests. I don't think they hit capacity limits during my time there, but I shudder to think what the park would look like if capacity limits were invoked. Even with the huge crowds, we still managed to have fun. It would just be better if the park management were making sure to manage the customer experience vis a vis wait times. One thing I have to say about Japanese Disney fans, they are very orderly and patiently stand in some of the longest lines I've ever seen at any Disney resort. Even the line for popcorn was 50 deep at times."
1237,5,17-Mar,Australia,DO NOT MISS THIS!,"Hubby and I had 16 days in Japan across March and April and I had allocated my birthday to go to Disneyland.. well there was our first mistake... only allocating one day. Get a 2 day pass bare minimum, its very busy with people and so many things to see and do and be part of. We are almost 40 both of us and we were like a couple of little kids all day and were still in the park after closing time from 9am. We were there for 14 hours!!! Hubby even suggested extending our pass to 2 days and postponing our trip back to Osaka for a day so we could spend another day in Disneyland. Catch the train to Maihama station from Tokyo for a few hundred yen and walk the rest of the few hundred metres to the attraction. The walk is amazing as you can see the castle from outside the park and as you get closer and closer the excitement builds!Number 1 after you purchase your ticket (around 7000 yen per adult for 1 day)..... if your carrying stuff...get a locker just before you enter the main section for a few hundred yen and dump your stuff before you get into the day. You can take your own food and drink.. this is a great way of saving money as some food and drinks inside are expensive and the lines are long. We took some and purchased some to lessen the cost and increase the convenience due to the long wait lines. Buy your Mickey ears or Minnie bows or other things you want to wear during the day at the start, but leave the rest of your merch till the end of the day unless you get a locker, you dont want to carry that around all day and try to shove it in places to go oin the rides.Dont miss the parade, twice a day once around 2pm and again around 7pm for the night parade with all the floats lit up. See both parades, its well worth it. Get your spot along the side of the road about an hour or more before hand to get the full experience.Rides can have you waiting a LOOOOONG time, the longest one we saw was 170 mins and the end of the line will be displayed on a tall sign being manned by a staff member. Splash mountain, thunder mountain and space mountain all seem to be the main rides people want to experience so expect lengthy delays there. We loved every ride we went on! On splash mountain iof you want to skip the line and are willing to ride seperate from others in your group tell the attendant at the end of the line you want to be a single rider.... that will cut your wait by a good hour or more. It just means you will probably go on the ride without anyone you know. We did it, it was great skipping the line. You can also get there VERY early and look into getting fastpasses for rides, you are basically allocated a time to go back to each ride you chose and you dont have to wait as long as if you just jump on the end of ther line.Check out EVERY land, we decided to skip Toontown because we thought it would be more for the little kids but ended up around the area so decided to go in after all.... it was so much fun! Half the fun of places like this is being able to revert back to your childhood and be reminded of watching Cinderella or Snow White and feeling the magic all over again. And you do... you REALLY do! You see the characters and the 6 year old inside you gets excited and next thing your asking strangers to take your photo with Mickey Mouse or escaping from Toontowns dog pound display! Go with it, its amazing. Wear comfy shoes as you will walk and stand in lines A LOT. If you have kids you can borrow strollers for the day and there is designated pram parks all over the park including at the entrance to the rides so you wont miss out.. Plenty of toilets with child facilities too.  Its a small world was closed for maintenance while we were there but the rest was open and fantastic! You HAVE to stay for the light and sound display and fire works that start around 9pm. theres a short display and you think oh that was nice... where are we going next.. then they announce that 'Once upon a time' will commence in 15 mins.. now THAT is something you CANNOT MISS! I almost cried I got so emotional as the childhood memoreis came flodding back, I even video called my mum back in Australia to show her it was soooo good! The lights, the sounds, the fire works and the images displayed on the front of the castle are astounding. Fantastic!I honestly cant say anything bad about that place and would go again in a heartbeat!"
1238,4,17-Apr,United States,The happiest place in Japan,How can you not be happy in Disneyland. It was cool seeing so many people (teenage girls) dressing up in Disney themed outfits. The lines are long we went on four rides. Pick one ride in advance and then go get the fast pass. Because there is so many people you will only get to do this once.
1239,4,17-Apr,Australia,A little busy. .,"Fantastic experience, very close to the original in Anaheim. Clean throughout and very friendly staff. Can become very overcrowded and huge lines, best to get fast passes early as they run out quickly! Not many characters about for photo's.. overall nice disney day out. ."
1240,4,17-Mar,Singapore,Great Disney Experience,went on Tuesday... still crowded with most local and students...having great fun in Disneyland... can re-enter Disneyland with your ticket/pass and hand(stamped)... will revisit again if coming back to Tokyo :)
1241,3,17-Apr,Singapore,No Character,"No Disney character at all (cant blame them as it rained whole day), so rather disappointed. Most rides will take about 60-90 minutes queuing without fastpass. Personally, I think Universal Studio Osaka will be more fun. Well, it suits kids more then adults."
1242,5,17-Feb,United States,Another Great Disney Experience,"I will preface this by saying that I am a HUGE fan of Disney. Being from the United States, I went to Walt Disney World in Orlando quite a few times throughout my life, and have probably experienced it from all perspectives (as an awe-struck 6 year old, as a ""too cool for school 13 year old, as an 18 year old interested in the business side of it, and as a 20 year old with my girlfriend at Disneyland Paris). This trip to Disney Tokyo was everything I could have hoped for. Now, after having been to Disneyland Paris I knew that all of the other Disneyland's don't compare to that of Disney World, so I had a good mindset going in. The park is small enough to do in 1 maybe 2 days, and wouldn't recommend any more time than that. Its just classic disney with all of the classic characters and rides. And its kind of cool to hear Buzz Lightyear speak Japanese while waiting inline for ""his ride"". Only negative experience that I had with the whole thing was really a minor thing. I am a 6 foot 3, in shape (not fat) 21 year old American, and am definitely the minority in Asia in terms of body size. My friend and I wanted to ride in the front car in Space Mountain but I was too big and didn't fit because my legs were too long. Even in one of the bigger carts in the back it was a very tight squeeze and was barely able to fit in the cart. I have never had that problem back home at any amusement park, especially not at Disney. But I understand that I am definitely not the typical customer that they get, so I don't really have a problem with it."
1243,3,17-Mar,Canada,Go early,"We arrived at 12:00 pm on a Thursday and most of the fast passes were gone for the day or were timed for the evening. Walking around there didn't seem to be too many people, yet the rides had up to a 2 hour line up. My kids are 17 and 21, they have been to California Disneyland 4 times over the past 10 years so they are quite familiar with navigating the park and rides. Tokyo Disneyland is similar to California, the main street is shorter. Disney Sea is very different from California Adventure. From 12-9:45 pm my kids only managed to ride 5 rides, so a bit disappointing. Also, the distance between Disneyland and Disney Sea is a bit of a walk so I suggest taking the monorail, which has a fee. I purchased my tickets online in Canada and in the North America the paper size is different so I was fortunate to reprint them in Japan. We purchased our After 6pm Disney Sea tickets at the Disney store in Shibuya. The tickets overall are cheaper then in California, It was good to experience but not the best for rides."
1244,2,17-Mar,Vietnam,Beautiful Disneyland but seriously crowded,"Just like any other Disneyland, beautiful and very detailed but it was extremely crowded. I would go as far to say as this was way more crowded than any other Disneyland. Also Fast Pass system is a nightmare!"
1245,1,17-Apr,Australia,Terribly disappointing - a total waste of money and time ,"We visited Disneyland, Tokyo on 4/4.  The train trip was quick and easy.  However, that is where the positives end.  After paying $AU 100, for entry we were met with huge crowds with inadequate amenities and 3 hour waits for all rides.  I am not sure how parents managed to keep their kids entertained waiting for the rides.   After walking around for 4 hours without having experienced any rides, we left as the lines for food were over 300 m long.  Seriously, it was terrible value for money. "
1246,5,17-Apr,United States,A must for children!,"Brought family here. Wish I visited in the summer months, because waiting in line for certain attractions in the cold and rain was terrible. Many great souvenirs here that you won't find anywhere else. Cast member characters are more enthusiastic compared to the ones in Orlando Disney. Tickets are fairly priced. Bring ponchos, they charge a fortune on them. Great stroller rental. Make sure you reserve your meal locations at least 48 hrs in advance! Will definitely try other locations!"
1247,4,17-Mar,N/A,Birthday trip to disney,Tokyo Disneyland trip was birthday related¬† it was great!Some character meet-and-greets were at the main entranceQueues to get through security checkpoint mvedd very quicklyLines were outrageous with two hour wait times spent time walking around the park in my opinion that was better than any ride
1248,1,17-Apr,N/A,Disappointing & Discriminating,"Multiple negative experience, worse as it is supposedly a fun-filled experience. Long queue for rides and even popcorn.  I understand that waiting can assist in anticipation but 2.5hours for meal and 1hr for popcorn is a bit ridiculous.  Nope, we didn't go on weekend, and it is not the golden week or Holiday. Another really discrimination experience is dining.  Finer table dining restaurants all require advanced booking.  It is ok if it is well mentioned or online booking is easily available, which unfortunately NEITHER is the case!  The website advanced booking is only available in Japanese only makes the situation more disappointing.Overall, we love Japan and Tokyo, but the experience in the Disneyland really leaves a bad taste, worse as it is our last leg of 12-day Tokyo trip...  "
1249,1,17-Apr,N/A,"Most crowded place on earth, definitely not the happiest","Context: We are in our twenties, first time to Tokyo disneyland, have been to Orlando disneyland, went on a Monday in April 2017.Tips for first-time goers: go at opening time, buy and print admission ticket in advance, download TDR app (wait times), get fast passes for the most popular rides first (eg space mountain, buzz lightyear) as fastpasses for these will run out by noon (can get fast passes every two hours), bring snacks/drinks, prepare to wait in queues for the entirety of your time here (1hr for food, 2hrs for rides), bring an entertainment device to pass time.This place is extremely, unbelievably crowded. We made the mistake of going at 10am instead of 8am. We got the star tours fast pass at 1030, then by the time two hours were up at approx noon, fast passes for most popular rides (eg space mountain, buzz lightyear) had already finished distributing. The only ride left for fastpass was haunted mansion - by this stage there was a long queue for the fastpass distribution itself.Overall we spent 8 hours here:- Luckily watched One Man's Dream show (recommend; lasts 30minutes)- waited 40 minutes for pirates of caribbean ride- Star tours ride via fast pass: definitely recommend however such a short ride- Waited 50 minutes for pizza lunch- waited 110 minutes for haunted mansion ride (do not recommend - narration in japanese, not a roller coaster but a swivelling seat)- Various 10-20minute waits in queues for popcorn, pastry, etc- Visited various gift shops that sell the same stuffEssentially you will come here, go on three rides, spend more money on food and souvenirs, and then wait for hours in queues. Also, the place was disappointing as it did not feel like a ""Disney""land at all. It just feels like a large open space with various plain buildings and some decoration inside whilst selling Disney merchandise. I will not be returning.Unhappy visitor."
1250,3,17-Apr,N/A,Vacation ,Over crowded and unable to ride more than 2 attractions. Limits should be set on how many people are allowed in the park
1251,2,17-Apr,United Arab Emirates,Not nice ,"Unacceptable the organization Waiting for 1hr just to take popcorn at kiosk is not acceptable , there shall be much much more than the one present there , this is just an example , I visited almost all Disney world and this is the only one with queue problem for everything ( outside rides and so for which long queue is ok to happen  ) This can be easily can be fixed And by there the way , I visited during weekday , I cannot imagine the weekend "
1252,4,17-Mar,New Zealand,Plan ahead! ,"This was our third visit to the park. It definitely helps to have some knowledge about the most popular rides, where to get fast passes, show times etc. March is the busiest month, so avoid it if possible, but if you're on spring break with everyone else, plan ahead, book online if possible, get there early (park opens at 8am) and be prepared to queue. We were there at 9am and fast passes for the best rides were giving a 530pm return time. My husband queued for 40 minutes just for popcorn! In the end we watched Super Duper Jumpin Time after waiting 40 minutes to save our spot. I recommend it because the characters all come into the crowd and mingle with the kids after the show. We waited 2 hours to save a great spot for the parade and in between rode the train and explored Tom Sawyers island because the lines were shorter. I'm glad we packed lunch because that would have been another long wait. There are two areas on opposite sides of the park with vending machines selling water, coke etc. Water is free in any of the dining areas. We refilled our drink bottles at those.Crowds aside, it's a great Disney atmosphere and very well organised. The only thing is the featured movies are all pretty old- think Pinocchio, Cinderella, Aristocats, Lilo and Stitch etc. Great for nostalgia but don't expect to see characters from anything recent. "
1253,4,17-Apr,United Kingdom,It's Disney ! ,"I have enjoyed just being in front of the gate, the atmosphere is great, and My daughter loved the place. The only thing that made our trip less enjoyable is the crowd! I was surprised to see too much people in the early 2 hours!! I understand it is Sunday, but I hadn't seen that much people last year. Other than that I could say it is worth to visit Tokyo Disney Land !"
1254,5,17-Mar,Australia,Love Disneyland - The happiest place on earth,"I recently visited Disneyland as part of a group.  I love Disney and wanted to see Tokyo's Disneyland.  We only had a few hours to explore and did so at night and take advantage of the cheaper tickets. We were able to get on quite a number or rides as it was quieter but can only image that during the day or on weekends the time to cue would be long. Most of the attractions are in Japanese (of which you would expect), and little English is spoken in the stores. We accessed the park by rail and was an easy 10 minute walk to the entrance.  The Disney Hotel looked very grand at night and is right opposite the park.  We enjoyed our few hours in the park and wished we could of stayed longer."
1255,5,17-Mar,Cambodia,Very nice place to visit,"I went there by tour group,we bought ticket but we can't play or join even one. There are thousand of people who wait for the long line. So we just walk and look around. There are many gift shops but very expensive.."
1256,5,16-Apr,Indonesia,"must get back to this place, once is never enough","one of great themepark, tokyo disneyland, offers a warm and happy of disney. great for family, lots of good photo spot.try to use fast pass, so you need no to queue long in attractions. catch the mascot and get their picture together"
1257,5,17-Mar,United States,Tips for visiting with toddlers or babies,"We brought two toddlers around 1.5 and 3 years old to Tokyo Disneyland and it worked out just fine. The toddlers are allowed to take all the rides which do not set height limits. However, babies must be awake to be permitted to get on certain rides. We highly suggest paying extra to skip the lines. Luggage can also be temporarily stored at the side of the entrance with a fee. Inside the park, most of food are pizzas, so suggest you bringing your own food if you don't like to have pizzas all day long."
1258,4,16-Dec,Malaysia,Fast Pass,Learn about the Fast Pass and beat the line!!! Was there early Dec with 2 kids (8 & 6) & love everything in there. Minnie's show was cancelled due to rain but we still enjoy all the rides. Christmas parade was awesome !!!!
1259,4,16-Dec,Australia,Everyone is clued in on fast pass. Don't be the only who isn't clued in on it',"We are in our 20s. Study your fast pass, download your tdr apps. Don't go on weekends or around holidays- look up traffic on dates. Pack your bag with tonnes of snacks as restaurants are pricey and you will be hungry from all the walking. Prioritise space mountain, it was one of the best. Poohs hunny hunt is extremely popular and very cute and nostalgic. Splash mountain is not bad. Thunder somethjng was terrible, crappy coaster ride.If you can successfully do this you will be able to complete all FP rides and a little more. We arrived 10 mins past opening. We managed during black period in Christmas with more than 60,000 people. Disney sea though is a new hell on its own. Our waiting times at most were 1.5 hrs for rides on disney land."
1260,5,17-Jan,N/A,Magical,"Went there in early Januari, cold weather with heavy rain but still enjoy playing in this magical place"
1261,5,17-Mar,Singapore,Where wishes come true!,"Great place for the adults as well as kids. Do take note of the various parade times so you get a good view of the parades as well as shows. Some restaurants, will need to book exactly 1 month in advance to reserve a slot as they are extremely popular. Especially the restaurant with Mickey. When i mean 1 month, i mean 1 month before at 0001 hrs to go in and book. Japan time. That's how popular they are if you want to secure the best seats in the house."
1262,4,16-May,Australia,"Lots of fun, but not great for English speakers","Having been to the US Dsineylands, this wasn't quite the same. There's a lot that's not in English so that makes it tricky. All else is typical of a fun Disney experience though."
1263,4,17-Mar,N/A,Enjoy the queues and remember the Fast Pass. ,"It really is a place where people of all ages have fun. Being the last school day before holidays there were many school groups. The rides though are fabulous. A hint: get in early get your first Fastpass for one of the rides. Queue for the next two hours at other rides, then get your next Fastpass. Rides like Space Mountain was very advantageous for this. A definite must when visiting Tokyo. "
1264,4,16-Dec,Indonesia,"Magical Place for Every Child Dreams, Don't forget your Fast Pass","We visited Tokyo Disneyland as group of friends. My thought about this place is Magical! Since we have our  ""child dreams"" to be a prince and princess, this is the exact place to see the magical things. Here is the world of imagination, hopes, and dreams.I recommend this place for Family or for Disney lovers out there because we can see more ""Disney"" inside out (compare to Disneysea), but for thrill seeker, this maybe not the right place for you. Because most of the attraction is kids-friendly.Compared to other theme park in Japan, this has shorter waiting time, but first you enter the park, check out the fast pass schedule on Board around the park. You just need to find the time the fast pass open for the attraction and scan your QR code (entrance ticket) to get the fast passes. We managed to get 3 fast pass that day.We arrived around 10 am and going back around closing time 10-11pm. We managed to play up to 10 attractions. Since we visited this around winter so we couldn't make it into splash mountain and unfortunately the big thunder mountain also closed. But we have our leisure time to take pictures and enjoy the beauty of the park. We recommended the Alice in wonderland food area, it's so beautiful yet delicious. If you're looking for tap for drinking water, it's quiet hard there but in every food area there's free drinking station with paper cup available.Don;t forget to get ready to watch the parade, fireworks, and closing show. (The schedule is in map when we entrance the park. Don't forget for each of you to bring the map in case some of you lost inside the park). The parade is so magical! I recommended you to watch the night parade because there's illumination effect and its more beautiful compared to previous noon parade. The best spot for you is near the Cinderella castle in Fantasyland but be ready for the full packed!"
1265,5,16-Oct,Kuwait,A recomended visit in Tokyo,"Wonderful Disneyland, spend a whole day there, specially the parades, I recommend you stay until it is dark to see the night illuminated unique parade, the problem with this park is the long lines! sometimes it is 45 minutes waiting, but it worth waiting, we had really happy day me and my wife"
1266,4,17-Feb,Indonesia,taking the starlight passport,"we only have a half day to visit Tokyo Disneyland. so we bought the starlight passport which allow you to enter the park started from 3 PM it cost cheaper than the 1 day passport. the queue for the rides was long as usual but the queue for the food and beverages was crazy. still, disneyland always amazed the inner child in me"
1267,4,17-Mar,United States,Be ready to wait! Long lines!,"I enjoyed Disneyland, but I was prepared for the crowds. Since we stayed at the hotel, we got the 15 minutes of early entry which helped get us ahead of the crowds. But for instance, we got to Space Mountain at opening and in 10 minutes, the wait time jumped to 130 minutes. We ended up waiting about an hour. Just be prepared. We enjoyed it though. Very clean!"
1268,5,17-Mar,Malaysia,we're back here again.....,"finally we are back here again after 6 years (2010)..but this time with our 2nd & 3rd child. got to love this Disneyland, the happiest place on Earth. we went on the Splash Mountain, my advice is do get the fast lane pass, as the normal line took us 2.5hrs to queue!! do the same for other rides. we went in a public holiday Monday (Equinox Day).. avoid public holidays if possible. purchase ticket online. "
1269,4,17-Mar,Philippines,The Magical Place of Every Child,I must say Tokyo Disneyland is one of the best Disney resort for kids in the world! The facilities are mostly caters to mom and kids. And It was the first time I've successfully watch the parade without crowed people standing everywhere!Frozen was the theme the time and we were just in time to watch the Frozen show projected at the castle! Pretty cool!!
1270,3,17-Mar,N/A,Kingdom without the Magic,"We made a special trip to Tokyo for our three year old's visit to Disneyland. We had brought him before to the Hong Kong Disneyland when he was younger. The park seems smaller than Hong Kong's and the crowds larger which made queues very long. It was very difficult to take photos with Mickey as there was always a long queue of ADULTS! There is no priority given to kids or babies for the queues. We only managed one ride after queuing for 2 hours. FastPass ends by 10am in the morning! The most enjoyable part of the day was watching the FROZEN parade with Elsa and Olaf for him. Many of the local parents brought groundsheets to sit on while waiting for the parade. It was a cold March day, so we didn't stay for the evening show. The Disney shops were interesting to visit and he found some Toy Story characters that are hard to buy outside."
1271,5,16-Sep,N/A,Magical!,"Disneyland will forever and always be a magical place no matter which Disney you visit. This Disney was just as magical as the others, even though it was heavily raining the entire day (it was sun untill we entered the park, haha).Great park with loads of fun to see and do!"
1272,4,17-Mar,Singapore,Tokyo Disneyland,"Tokyo disneyland give us a quite good impression. From the atmosphere where most people queue in good manner (even in rainy day and in a very cold weather), friendly staff (even most of them speak only japanese) and very accessible by using public transport. We also like the fast pass provided at the parks with no additional cost. What we need to do is grab the fast pass during diapensing time by scanning the barcode at our tickets and come during the specified timing. So that we can enjoy more attraction and rides. The Attractions and rides very suitable for kids. So far only one attraction which is stich interaction which is done in japanese and we can't understand a single words.There are plenty snacks available in the park such as popcorn, turkey leg, churos, ice cream but most of the stalls have quite long queue. Food served at the stall also quite nice and reasonably priced. We did not go to more fancy restaurant. "
1273,1,17-Mar,Singapore,Staff of Tokyo Disneyland showed racism against non-japanese,"After watching the Frozen light show at the castle, my helper, Son n I were told that we could wait at the side for the front to open and we could sit there to enjoy the fireworks. As such, we proceeded there to join a batch of crowds. When the barrier were lifted, we all went in and we chose the last row as I wanted to catch a full view of the fireworks and at the middle as everyone moved in tandem to find our space since it's free sitting on the ground. my helper sat beside me on the last row while we let my Son move infront of us. Besides me and my helper, there were Japanese young girls. My helper sat half  to a feet infront of the Japanese girl besides her. Then a male staff from Disneyland insisted tt we move away just bec the japanese gal refused to give space to us when we requested. He and his colleagues insisted that it was too cramp. He  and his colleagues later told me there's only two space. so I ask my helper to go to another place at the side and meet me later. But he and his staff came back again n told us there's only 1 space. They changed their version n asked us to move to the side to join Yati. At this point I stood firm on my position as there's about 2 feet spaces infront of me, I placed my bag infront of me and there were quite a lot of space infront of the girls infront of us and I'm not touch anyone. That lady besides me complaint that I touched her which was untrue. Staff of Disneyland kept insisted that my Son n I shift to the sides because the girl besides me made a complaint. I went to see the customer service manager after the fireworks, he refused to take down my complaint. He asked that male staff to meet us at the customer service and I see no point and left. "
1274,5,16-May,Thailand,The place that bring you back to your childhood memory,The most popular dream destination for our childhood memory is Disneyland theme park the place that made the adult and old man back to be the child. No more comment just come and enjoy with your childhood memory.
1275,4,17-Mar,Russia,Disneyesque,Like all Disney parks Tokyo DIsney is well-organized and very friendly. A monorail takes you around the different parts of Disney including Disney Sea and the hotels. Long waiting lines for the major attractions are par for the course.
1276,2,17-Mar,New Zealand,Prepare to queue!,We spent a full day here and found it a huge disappointment. The queues were horrendous - up to three hours on the more popular rides. We were there on a Monday - apparently weekends are worse. Miss 11 and Mr 9 only got to do two junior rides each because of the queues. Express tickets disappeared so fast we couldn't even put them to use. The rest of the time we spent being crushed in the hoards of people. On the bright side the parades were awesome - especially the electric parade at night. However unfortunately a downpour struck and there were so many people there wasn't enough shelter so we ended up getting soaked to the skin! We left with both kids in tears. We definitely won't return and feel we wasted a valuable day of our holiday. Unless you are a die-hard Disney fan I would suggest giving this place a very wide berth. 
1277,5,16-Oct,Indonesia,Might not be the best but the atmosphere was the best,"Compared with DisneySea, the Land feels very average. It might not be the best Disneyland, especially if you compare to those in USA. But what I like the most is the atmosphere. Japan certainly can brings out the ""magic"" in Disney. It could be the staff, it could be the technology, it could also be the visitors. You just cant feel it in any other Disney parks.The rides here are mostly aimed for kids. If you are looking for adrenaline rush, go to FujiQ instead where they have one of the scariest roller coaster in the world, and the scariest haunted house ever in life.Make sure to plan ahead before your visit. It can get very crowded on weekends, public holiday, and high season. Avoid national holidays for neighboring countries too, such as China, Korea, etc. Chances are they will come to visit Japan during their holiday, and visit Disney parks. Do some research beforehand. Land is usually less crowded than Sea. When we came last October, it felt like the park belonged only to us.Buy ticket online to avoid wasting 1 hour to queue up for the ticket. Once you enter the park, run to the most famous attraction and grab the Fast pass, then you queue on the least famous attraction. That way you can maximize your fun."
1278,4,17-Mar,Singapore,Wonderful trip,"There were a lot of fun rides at Disneyland, such as It's a small world, Peter Pan's adventure and many more. My family had thoroughly enjoyed it!!!"
1279,1,17-Mar,United States,"Horrible, crowded, unfrienndly experience","I've been to all but Shanghai Disney and Disney World 12+ times. Never, ever had experience like at Tokyo Disneyland/DisneySea. Lines are 4+ hours. Fast passes are completely gone before noon. So you get to ride 3-4 rides in a day.  I would never suggest anyone visit these parks. Stick to the other ones. This is what happens when Disney doesnt own the park, this company (Oriental Land Company) doesnt care if it ruins the Disney brand, since they arent Disney."
1280,5,16-Apr,Canada,Amazing experience,"As someone who never visited any Disneyland before, I was awestruck.The lines took a while, and it's highly recommended to learn how the fast-track ticket system works prior to arrival, but we had a blast!Get as early as possible. it's worth the early awakening. "
1281,5,17-Mar,N/A,hell with very sweet topping,"I had two kids with me. First time.Choosing the date:We checked from the internet when there will be fill rate of max 50%.Choosing the restaurant: Always book in advance. We were in cristal palace. Very good and worked for us nice.Where to go: everywhere. I loved the boats and the train and of course thePuh....Popcorn in robot is a must.It feels that you will die there, because of the ques and big crowd around you, but you know it is Disney World where everybody are happy and at the end will be you!!!ENJOY.."
1282,1,17-Feb,Australia,Too crowded.,Be prepared to stand in line all day.Park is way too small and they let too many people in. It can take 30 minutes just to buy a snack.lines for rides are around 2 hours long. The fast passes are the worst idea ever. The lines would move faster without them. Park is really tiny and only takes an hour to see everything if you don't want to go on the rides.
1283,5,17-Jan,China,Amazing,"Lots of fun! So Amazing! Everything is very wonderful! Mark your favorite one and get the fastpass to enjoy it again, or you will have to take it next time as there should be SO MUCH people who are also very much excited to queue for it! The food is also nice, also staff, casting etc.."
1284,3,17-Mar,Costa Rica,Nice but way too crowded,"As always Disney is a wonderful dreamworld! Lots of fantasy, magic and fun! Nevertheless it was way too crowded; most of the attractions had a wait time of 2 hours. To be honest I just made the line for 5 of them... and I walked the rest of the day and return early to my hotel! It's a shame that the visitors can't enjoy the majority of attractions because it's extremely crowded! Besides there was only one ride with the option for single riders...which was bad for me! I guess the management should try quality vs. quantity... a bit less visitors, but happier ones! "
1285,5,17-Feb,Singapore,The best highlights of my trip in Tokyo,"Worth the price. Spent a full day in the park from morning 10am to night 9pm. All activities, rides, shows etc are fun and interesting which suitable for all ages. Many eateries and restaurants here also in a reasonably price. Suggest you try the curry popcorn, Great American Company waffles, Disney ice cream etc. Wonderful trip and memories in my Travelogue. I hope I will be back here for my honeymoon trip also in future."
1286,5,17-Mar,N/A,Use the Fastpass,i love the park and its beautiful castle. however the crowd is insane! use the fastpass to plan your trip and take those rides which has lesser pp first.
1287,5,17-Mar,Thailand,Fun,"The famous place for children dream. Spend a whole day there, enjoy and relax with the Disney atmosphere."
1288,4,16-Jun,Norway,Fun to visit!,"Had a great time at Disneyland Tokyo! If you love amusement parks and Disney, then it¬¥s definitely worth visiting! Everything is fantastic, from meeting Disney-characters, to the food, the rides, everything. It¬¥s a fantastic world to enter, it might be better for families seeing as it is Disney, but they have something for everyone.You should also check out some of the stores. They had so much fancy and amazing stuff, like the Alice in Wonderland teapot and cups."
1289,4,17-Feb,Philippines,Bad Weather but fun with snow,Its our first time in Tokyo Japan and upon arrival to the airport we went directly to Disneyland since we only have 4 days itinerary and we came by 11am and our hotel allow 3pm check in. Unfortunately its raining when we arrived and we do had our luggages with us. We decided to bring our luggages first in our hotel baggage counter since there was a free shuttle bus at Oriental Hotel Tokyo Bay so its not hassle to do so.. Tokyo Disneyland is much bigger than Hongkong Disneyland in my opinion. Its good that there was a covered place there so we did a shopping while rains didnt stop. Sad to say parade was suspended as well as fireworks due to inclement weather. But my daughter had fun since we saw snow while raining which was the primary reason we visited Japan.
1290,5,17-Mar,Finland,Amazing! ,"Our family with kids aged 6, 7 and 11 had an awesome day in Disneyland. Never visited Disneyland before, so all was new and amazing. I especially loved the Frozen parade and- light show. It was nice that the attractions suited the whole family. Recommended! "
1291,5,17-Feb,Thailand,Lovely,"This is fourth time, every times we spend full day in the park ,Open to Close. All staffs very helpful and friendly, all activities are fun and a lots, all ages can come and plays. "
1292,5,17-Feb,Singapore,Disneyland . Bring you back as a KID ;),"Nearest Train station is Maihama station ËàûÊµúÈßÖ.Once you exit turn from Maihama station right and walk about 12 to 20 mins walk . You can take thier tokyo resort line ( my advise skip it)  . Because there is a big souvenirs shop on the way to Disneyland theme park .Ticket:- refer their website- My advise get two days ticket . so sad that we spend one whole day from day to night . yet didnt play all the games Fast past:- Note that you unable collect two fastpast ticket for same timing . refer behind fastpass instruction- During the game , staff will collect back the fastpast ticket. - Dont lost your admission ticket .

1293,5,17-Jan,Australia,So much variety,This would be one of the best Disneylands we've been to. They have numerous parades and shows! The queue for the rides can be quite long though. I think they can also do better by improving the food choices. Its expensive but thats the same in every Disneyland we've been to.
1294,5,17-Feb,Indonesia,Happy Place Indeed!,"Prepare to spend the whole day here! Wear your most comfortable outfits (especially shoes), as you will have a long walk. I'd say most of the ride are suitable for kids, compare to DisneySea. If you're lucky (or visit here during low season), the waiting time are much much better, it can only take up 5-15 mins per ride. Means, you can ride more attractions. But, if you're coming during high season (namely during Hanami or Golden Week), be prepared to take a much longer waiting time."
1295,5,16-Aug,United Kingdom,Typical Disney,Typical disneypark - great rides and shows. Was lovely to see the Japanese wearing cute matching t shirts.Not many characters to get photos / autographs with unlike in the USA
1296,5,17-Feb,N/A,Loved it! Wear comfy shoes! ,"Absolutely loved Tokyo Disneyland! Go during the week - weekends and holidays are crazy busy! A few tips: get in early (Disneyland opens at 8am, DisneySea at 8.30am). You go through security but the checking isn't very thorough! We took food and drink in with us and they didn't bat an eyelid. The great thing about Tokyo Disney is the Fast Pass system - very unlike any I've come across elsewhere. It is free! All the rides marked with FP on the maps have a separate FP stall near to that ride's entrance.  You can get a FP here for that ride and return at a later point. The only hitch is that you can only have one FP at a time, so you need to plan ahead a little (e.g. Get a FP as soon as you arrive, for say, Space Mountain, and then as soon as you've done that ride or the FB time limit reopens, grab your FP for Thunder mountain). The Hunny Pot ride was busy (not an adrenaline seekers ride, but definitely one not to miss!). The Toy Story ride and Monsters Inc were both incredibly busy. Oddly, Star Wars did not seem a busy ride. We went on it three times, and it's worth noting that each ride was different - a different pilot, story, scene-scape, etc If you like Meet & Greets but don't fancy the queues, hang around in the entrance area (after you've got your first Fast Pass) - there are tonnes of characters who pop out every half hour or so to have their photos taken with visitors. "
1297,5,16-Sep,N/A,Kids dream place. ,Fantastic place for the young or young at heart but the crowd is amazing! Be prepared to queue for everything. Especially like parade where all the Disney characters are shown.
1298,5,17-Feb,N/A,Food,"It's a magical place.Yes, it is expensive.Yet, there are ways to save money once you have entered.A big way to save money is on food.The queue to buy even a hamburger is as long as it is to take a ride (pardon the pun).I have had to wait for up to an hour (pardon the pun, again). And, that hamburger will cost you in not only money, but also in patience.Add a hungry young child into the equation, the Magic of Disney can become the Tragic of Disney.So, how to save money on food and avoid any bitter memories you will try to overpaint with ""But, Splash Mountain was all the worth for it 'though, wasn't it?""The answer...Bring your own food.Disneyland has a policy.You can not bring in any food.From a business point, this is great.From a human point, this is not great.Please follow...1. There is a 'security check' before entry.2. The 'checkers' are part-time.3. The 'checkers' are part-time students.4. They will check inside your bag.5. Are they looking for W.O.M.D.?6. No. They are looking for food.7. Fast Forward...8. I'll raise you by two rice balls & a banana.It's true. Under the guise of security, they are looking for food.Yet, they can not check your person.So, two rice balls and a banana can go in your pockets.They will only be able to ask ""Are you happy to see me? Or do you have...?""Enjoy Tokyo Disneyland. It truly is magical!Actually, I'd like to live there."
1299,5,16-Mar,Australia,Adult Group Day Trip - FUN - Worth It!,"Did this with my husband, my siblings and their partners during a winter ski trip Tokyo stop over. Have not been to any other Disneyland so do not have an English version to compare to, but we had a blast! Run around like little kids and enjoyed all of the cheesy but awesome Disney must-dos. Best ride was Space Mountain. Both the day and night parades were spectacular. The food was everywhere and delicious."
1300,3,17-Feb,United Kingdom,Mainly for kids no adult rides,"Was fun to see but no adult rides mainly for kids , queues were massive everywhere you go IE rides , restaurants and shops etcHighlight was the Disney parade"
1301,5,16-Apr,Brazil,The DisneyLand to beat!,"This is the BEST ""Magic Kingdom"" park in the world far as I can tell, this has all of the charm of the original with better rides even if the ride is the same as others rest assure this one usually have the best version due better paint jobs, newer animatronics and such. The park has separation between all of its theme areas and also a better circular layout than its California counterpart.The cast members are the BEST as well super polite and always ready to help you even if they don't speak your language. This is a must visit in Tokyo and in your lifetime."
1302,4,17-Feb,N/A,Paying for happiness ,"Disneyland is a must see at least once in your life. But it is definitely expensive. All of the displays and attractions are of the upmost quality, though. The rides are kept up to date with the latest and greatest from Disney. It is a kids dream one true. Plenty of places to sit and relax and recharge because it should be a day long event. Food is expensive, thrilling rides have hour long lines on weekdays, can't imagine the weekends. The Frozen ice castle show was packed and amazing but the fireworks were cancelled due to wind. Like I said, once in a lifetime, must go. But I can't afford to go more than that. "
1303,5,16-Dec,United Kingdom,The happiest place on earth, I have been to almost every disneyland (except the shanghai one and the one in florida) and can i say that tokyo disneyland is my absolute favourite?I dont know whats that with tokyo disneyland but it definitely made you feel like the most magical place on earth - it may be the hospitality of friendly japanese (though you'll be slightly flustered at times if you dont understand japanese) or it might be the fact that japanese do have a genuine interest in dressing up for disney regardless of age. It just made you feel really happy:) (it might also be that Im a hardcore disney fan- i just sang along to the music played through disneyland)And the merchandise are super adorable. Definitely recommended for people to visit! My boyfriend enjoyed it a lot even when hes totally not into disney:)
1304,5,16-Dec,Philippines,incredible highlight of the event/experience,This is the second time I been here after Hong Kong Disney Land.The side is 10 times bigger than HKDL.
1305,5,17-Feb,N/A,Very reasonable ,Super clean and orderly. Prices are better than other Disneyland around the world & the most important thing is Food prices is very reasonable.
1306,4,17-Feb,China,Had so much fun,"I went with my 6 yr old child and we arrived sharply by 8am because wanted to get ahead before it got crowded and it was way worth it, especially we had to leave by 3pm for a flight. We were a bit disappointed some of the rides were closed for construction but nowhere in the process of buying the tickets, entrance etc...we were informed about it. I forgot the ride name it was a far walk. You can buy a day pass and upgrade to another if needed but this upgrade needs to be done before you leave the park."
1307,5,17-Feb,Japan,Incredible ,Tokyo disneyland is an amazing place for people under all kind of ages. It is the best place in Tokyo for kids to plays and for families or friends to hang out. I love it. It is big and beautiful and very crowded at night. It is much more gorgeous at night with the lights. I am so lucky to see the parade in so many colors of electrical lights. That is one of my most incredible memories in my Tokyo tripYou guys should go there once if you come to Tokyo. 
1308,5,16-Sep,Australia,day or night...definitely the happiest place on earthüôÇ,It's definitely worth a visit if you're a Disney fan.  Our flight was delayed and slept in the following day...reason why we came late in the afternoon.  We even considered not going anymore since we've been to HongKong Disneyland a couple of years ago...and we're just glad that we went.  We felt more welcomed in Tokyo for some reason...maybe the staff smile a lot more in Tokyo.  We definitely enjoyed every minute of our time there.  Dream Lights parade was just amazing!
1309,5,16-Apr,United States,My First International Disney,"I loved being here - it was like a mini version of Disney in Orlando! I loved going to some of my favorite rides and hearing it in Japanese! A lot of the time the rides stopped due to electricity but it was still a lot of fun to be in the area. The staff was friendly and you still felt the ""Disney Magic""."
1310,5,17-Feb,Australia,Magical,"This was my first disney experience and I loved every second of it! Very worth the money and the food was AMAZING (and really, it didn't need to be!). The rides here were so fun and I definitely recommend staying into the night if you can because the night vibe from the park is magical."
1311,5,16-Sep,New Zealand,Great experience!,"I was dreading visiting Disneyland in Tokyo, but went anyway for our small children - and what lovely, fun day it turned out to be! Children enjoyed the rides, and it was actually fun for adults as well. As a parent, I was so impressed with how well-organised and friendly the place was. Toilets everywhere, no waiting, clean. Food easy to find, no waiting, delicious. We had to wait for some rides, but waiting areas were shaded and air-conditioned, so it was not too bad. I would recommend purchasing fast passes for popular rides. We also took out their stroller for our younger daughter, and it was a blessing, as she got tired of walking. Overall, it really was a magical experience. No negatives, really happy we went there."
1312,5,16-Oct,N/A,Fantastic and so magical!,It was a memorable experienced visiting Tokyo Disneyland...  I enjoyed taking pictures together with the Disney characters... They also have an artistic and colorful Disney Parade.....Nice fireworks at night. It was so AMAZING AND MAGICAL!!!!
1313,5,16-Sep,Australia,So much fun even for adults!,"We stayed onsite at one of the Disney hotels, which allowed us early entry into the park. This definitely came in handy, as it allowed us to secure a fastpass for Pooh's hunny hunt straight away. My advice would be, have a strategy for getting your fast passes and prioritise what rides you want to do. If you're only visiting for the day, this is the best way to see and do as many things as possible. If you come into the park without a plan, you will most likely be waiting in queues for most of the day.TIP- During parades, the lines get quieter, so this is a good time to try and get on rides. A lot of the seasonal entertainment will be mainly aimed at Japanese guests, but the Night parade is absolute MUST.If you have more than one day, it will be easier to just look around without having to race to each ride. In general, I would plan on staying for the entire duration that the park is open, i.e.- 8:30am-10pm. It is a tiring day, but you can always stop for a rest and snack throughout the day. Plenty of options for food, including some upscale restaurants such as The Blue Bayou and Crystal Palace. You won't be disappointed!"
1314,5,17-Feb,N/A,Love it ,"When you are in the happiest place on earth, nothing will go wrong. Love the surrounding and friendly staff. Food varieties are good. Just that there is a particular eatery that need us to make a purchase before and we are able to sit down. They don't even let us settle our daughter on the table despite explaining that my daughter fell and need a rest while my husband buying and queuing for food. The staff still insists 3 of us queue together to buy food before enter. And 1 person can only buy 1 food. But overall a happy place "
1315,5,17-Feb,United States,Doesn't disappoint ,We bought after 6 tickets after doing all we wanted at DisneySea. We were visiting on a low crowd day and we're able to ride all major attractions. Only thing we missed was meeting Mickey. We went to his house and it was under renovation. 
1316,4,17-Jan,Australia,One for the child in the adult and the adult and the child,"We spent our second last day in Tokyo visiting this attraction on a Saturday. My 15 year old daughter loved the place. We haven't been to other Disney sites but this place was quite pleasant to visit and accumulate my 10 km a day walk perambulating around the different rides, theatres and features. Once it hit about 1 pm the place was absolutely crowded and the wait for some rides got to 45-60 minutes but if you're in not in a tearing hurry there's always another turn to make and something to see or do. Food is palatable, there are attendants everywhere who were very generous and kind to us with directions and suggestions as we only had the one day to visit, and there are also plentiful bathrooms and even a smoking room. Had enormous fun riding in magic teacups and seeing my 15 year old teenager laugh like a child again and also shopping for takeaways is a pleasurable experience in itself. Typical Tokyo; cool, pleasant, urbane and yet so much fun with nice people."
1317,5,16-Oct,United Kingdom,Incredible Experience,"As an avid Disney fan, i was super excited to visit Tokyo Disneyland, especially y because this would be my first Disney trip. It certainly did not disappoint. We visited Tokyo in October 2016 & stayed in ikebukuro. It was fairly easy to get to, via the bus ride from Shinjuku station, we pre booked the Disney tickets at the Disney store, and spent all day there. Magical experience. "
1318,5,17-Feb,N/A,Great Fun,"We visited this place while on vacation the end of 2016 to early 2017. great fun, especially for children. Although at the time it was very cold temperature up to 5 degrees Celsius, but we can still enjoy all the attractions that exist, primarily parade. In general, this place is the best place worldwide to have fun, especially for children and families."
1319,4,16-Dec,Australia,Amazing place but make sure to plan your visit!,"This is a quintessential Disneyland, with a wide mix of attractions and the atmosphere and theming you would expect from Disneyland parks. However, lines can be long, so make sure you make ample use of Fastpasses in order to cut the lines - the best thing to do is to get Fastpasses for the most popular rides, and use the time to fit in as many of the other, less popular (i.e. shorter wait) rides in between. The park might not be suitable for teens who are more interested in thrills as opposed to theming (the only major rollercoaster is Space Mountain). Also, almost every ride is in Japanese."
1320,5,17-Jan,N/A,A great Disney park,Tokyo Disneyland has great attractions and is a great Disney park to attend.  We only went for a few hours (at a very discounted rate as well thanks to after 6 PM prices) and were able to get on the best rides with little waiting.
1321,5,16-Mar,Philippines,My happy place!,"A must visit theme park for people with young at heart. Although, this was not my first time to visit a Disneyland theme park but my Tokyo Disneyland experience was superb~~ The place is clean, staffs are nice, and amazing rides! People of different ages will definitely enjoy."
1322,5,16-Oct,United States,Wonderful park!,"This park is very cool. It feels like a mix of the Disneys in Anaheim, Orlando, and Paris. It's huge, beautiful, and not too crowded. Definitely worth a visit. I suggest going in October so you can see all of the AMAZING costumes the locals wear during the Halloween celebration - best show of costumes you'll see!"
1323,4,16-Oct,New Zealand,Disneyland,"I havent been to the other ones so I cant compare but the Japanese sure loves Disney. There's families, couples, groups (both tourists and locals) whom would dress up as Princesses or have the matching Disney clothing. It created a friendly an fun atmosphere to the park.The park is smaller yet still with fast passes we still missed some rides as esp towards the evening the lines could be over 1hr wait period. We missed all the parades (because of the long ride queues and saw them from the view of our line) and even the night light show. Im disappointed with that as they did announced that it wasnt going to show yet they still went ahead with it and so we were too late to get into a nice spot to view it. Tip- get in early to see the Night lights show at the castle.  Its really breathtaking. I sadly had a side view with many heads and bushes. Maybe its worth to visit the park over 2 days esp during a busy season and if your travelling with younger children.  We stayed there from open til close and didnt get back to our hotel in Shinjiku until midnight. Though it would be very pricy esp to stay closer to Disney or purchase a 2 day pass. The rides were more catered for younger children. I dont think there was one which would cause a huge adrenaline rush. Its very family orientated and targeting  younger children.  Overall, we still loved Disney. "
1324,5,17-Feb,Australia,Sooo much fun!!,I give Tokyo Disney land 5/5!!! What a great theme park... super clean! And didn't have to wait long at all for the rides. U can rent a pram which was handy as it was only me and my 2 year old son! And he could pretty much go on every ride except about 4! So many food options and the rides are spot on! Love this place!
1325,5,16-Nov,United States,A great experience!,"Our first trip to Tokyo was one spent at Disneyland, which has two different parks, Disney Sea and Disneyland. There are many similarities to the USA Disney experiences yet there are many differences. Most attractions are spoken in Japanese but the signage has several languages on them. The Winnie the Pooh ride was a new one for them and it was amazing. It had the feel of bumper cars and of being on a trampoline. An adult and children's ride for sure. The Main Street Cafe was a fabulous place for breakfast. The crowds were pretty thick in both parks. We spent only an evening at the Sea park side and could not ride all we wanted because of the lines. The weather wasn't too chilly except for one afternoon when we were leaving the park. We hope to make this a yearly experience!"
1326,5,17-Jan,Netherlands,Loved every minute of it!!,"We had the most amazing time at Tokyo Disneyland!We bought our tickets at a travel ticket bureau (the one that sells train tickets and travel cards) so we could save ourselves queuing on the day - highly recommended to get tickets in advance!We took the train which stops right outside the park and the entrance is a short walk.  From the moment you step through the red arch, you hear Disney music and see small bronze statues on the fences.  We managed to get through straight away with our tickets.We didn't queue too long for rides.  The longest wait was Space Mountain which was 45 minutes, but so worth it!  We used the Fast Track option for Monsters Inc Ride & Go Seek and Big Thunder Mountain.  The only issue with the Fast Track option is that you can only get a pass every two hours and the times may not be favourable.  We used the Monsters Inc pass machine at around 11am and got a pass to go back at 6.30pm.The only ride we didn't go on was Splash Mountain because it was 8 degrees that day - a little chilly to go on!  A shame as this is the only ride that takes a photo of you on the ride.We only saw one character throughout the park - a green soldier from Toy Story.  Mickey and Minnie stand just after the park's main entrance, but there is quite a queue to meet them and have a photo taken.We enjoyed everything in the park.  The food outlets are very reasonable as are the souvenir shops.  We also went to Westernland Picture Parlour where you are dressed up in Western clothing and you get your picture taken.We stayed til around 8pm, so we managed to catch the light parade which was absolutely stunning.Yes, it is mainly in Japanese, but we didn't seem to notice too much.  Most of the staff speak English and can understand you a little.The park was so incredibly neat and tidy as well - the staff work so hard to make this a dream day out!An amazing day!"
1327,4,16-Oct,N/A,Disney at Halloween time,"Definitely a must do in Tokyo. It's a smaller park compared to the American ones but that's what's great about it!!! The fast pass is included and on your ticket and really does save you time.  No language barriers, everyone is friendly and helpful!! "
1328,5,17-Jan,Singapore,One Day of FUN; is not enough!,"Best to stay there for a few days at their resort if you wish to cover all the rides and attractions! If it's just for a day's visit (like I did), then it's more like skimming through the park and you can only expect a couple of rides and attractions and some pictures so be sure to be there early and go for the FastPass! Can't say much as I didn't get to do everything but it was definitely packed with lots of fun and colourful activities!"
1329,4,16-Nov,Singapore,Huge beautiful theme park!,"This Disneyland might be older than the rest in Japan, but it certainly doesn't look like it's age at all! It's huge and excellently well maintained. And clean!! Unfortunately, the performances and ride dialogues are in Japanese, creating a little puncture in our appreciation of the rides.Tip: Make use of the express pass right from the start of the day. Most of our day is spent queueing. By the time we use an express pass, it's kinda too late to enjoy it."
1330,4,16-Dec,Australia,Japan and Disney,"What an amazing beautiful clean attraction to visit. Friendly no fuss fun, even though it's all in Japanese, it didn't matter, we still enjoyed our time. Recommend fast tracking rides where you can, it just gives you time to move around more. Going at Christmas time makes it even more magical."
1331,4,17-Jan,N/A,Had a pretty good time,"First time going with my son thats 3yrs old.  He had a blast, everything he was big enough to ride.  The park was very clean, lines were tolerable.  Several people seem like they live there and have no life besides Disneyland, move on people, there is more to live.  Some shows were kind of a bummer since Japanese only, though my wife is Japanese and i know enough to get by.We will go back thats for sure, its for the son not me, but i just offer some info."
1332,5,16-Jul,Australia,Did Disneyland solo and it was still fun,"Spent 1/2 day wandering the park, lined up for a few rides. Had lunch at the American Dinner. Lines were long but manageable throughout the park. I wouldn't recommend going solo but I had to tick it off the list! Worth it. It's easy to get to the park from the city. "
1333,3,17-Jan,Singapore,Magical land for all,"A magical land for all ages to enjoy with family and/or group of friends. Majority of the Japanese dress in the same color or synchronize outfit for the trip, so need not worry to dress up to meet your favorite Disney characters! The shows were spoken in Japanese, if you don't understand Japanese, you might not be able to enjoy most of it. Advisable not to visit during the holidays and/or weekends cause it's gonna be very crowded everywhere. Although most of the attractions had long queues, but the waiting time wasn't as bad as told by the staff."
1334,1,17-Jan,Bahrain,Family Vacation,Well what i can say is... if you are not a Japanese nor cannot understand and speak Japanese then avoid going to Disneyland coz you will not enjoy. There are few reasons on why i say this... 1. All shows are in Japanese Language 2. Most of the staffs are unable to speak english.. 3. Big que on rides most specially during weekend.. Tokyo Disneyland is not good for foreigner.. better to go to HK disneyland if you really want to enjoy..
1335,5,16-Feb,Australia,Not just for the kids!,"I was 23 when I finally got to go to Disneyland... and loved every bit of it!!! I felt like a big kid in, well, Disneyland! There were plenty of rides, great choices of food. The parade was amazing, the night time lights parade was fabulous. We stayed for 9 hours and I could have done more! The only bad thing I experienced was they didn't do the fireworks (due to bad weather), but I can't blame the park for that. So I will definitely be back!"
1336,5,16-Dec,China,Enjoying the last day of 2016!,"We planned our Disneyland trip on the last day of 2016 and it was really great! Not many people, though we need to leave the park at 6pm but that's already tiring and enough for us! It's a must to download the apps so that you would have a better picture of waiting/ queuing time for the games. Remember to take fast pass for the popular games and it would be full before noon."
1337,4,17-Jan,Australia,Frozen Fever.....literally! ,"With the temperature only reaching a max of 5 degrees on the day we visited, we were certainly forced to embrace Frozen Fever! There were times during the day we needed to get our 3yr old & 4yr old out of the cold, but we found it very difficult to find suitable, accessible indoor locations. Most of the restaurants we tried were booked out, so we ended up joining a 45minute queue for the House of Cards restaurant, which was extremely challenging with cold, hungry and tired toddlers. On a positive note, the kids really loved their day at Disneyland. We managed to squeeze in 18 attractions and 4 parades/shows! The queues for the actual rides were considerable but not as bad as we'd expected. All staff were amazing. We'd take the kids back when they're a bit older, but we'd definitely choose a weekday when it's less busy, and we'd also pre-book a restaurant......just to be able to sit down and relax for a bit! "
1338,4,16-Nov,Singapore,Crowded but Magical,"So crowded, though we went on a weekday n was there at 9am when they opens! But definitely kids favourite, every family should go at least once. Long Q for most rides... Shorter waiting time for rides like carousel. Love the retail shops, parades & theme food! Can easily spend the entire day here, becos of the Qs! And don't forget to stay for fireworks, beautiful!"
1339,5,17-Jan,Australia,Happiest Place On Earth! ,"Walk in the gates and do yourself a favor get yourself some ears! I'm talking Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, character heads, you name it! Wear them all day long to bring out your happiness and inner child love for all things happy! Best tip get fast passes tickets from online so you don't spend hours lining up... lots of fun to be had but it will take you all day to get around to most of the park and even then you will most likely miss some rides as it's always busy...  everyone is polite so don't worry if you have young kids and worried about the volume of people and take a stroller to get around as the grounds are very big... if you have a stroller like a YoYo (fabulous traveling stroller only weights 5.5kg and folds up to carry and put up in over head lockers in plane) take it! If not best excuse to get one! Lots of things to do for toddlers to adults... If you can stay for the park closing lights parade it's definitely worth it. Eating around the park is easy and best pic for restaurant is the queen of hearts in fantasyland.  Food is better than all the snack food and it's very pretty inside.Most loved ride is it's a small world If you have girls make sure you go up inside Cinderella's castle as it's a princess paradise up there... have you pic taken sitting in her chair and try in the glass slipper. It's also the largest castle of all the Disneyland's.   Something we missed this time if you check the map there is a collectors area and you can buy visitor pins... these are great mementos of your visit and great if you get a special year celebration such as 15 years etc milestones and they are small to keep and can pass on to your kids kids  I still have mine from over 15 years ago at Anaheim.  This year is a special anniversary if you can make it. It's very easy to get to by train if you are not staying at the resort In winter it's really cold down there as it's close to the water so make sure you take gloves scarf coat and have thermal layer on... we went in January and just got back from the snow and we were cold!  But it wasn't windy just cold... we didn't really see Disney jumpers as we thought we would so best to be prepared make sure kids have plenty of warm clothes. Check the map for rides that are closing this year to get to go on those! As it gets dark earlier in the afternoon in winter make sure to check out toon town early so there plenty of light Had a great time can't wait to go again! There is a cream cheese like bagel you can get in Toon town that is really yummy to tryThe toy and hat stands in fantasy land have lots of really fun toys you don't get at the front entry shops so if you see something you like get it when you see it!  "
1340,5,16-Dec,Spain,So magical!,I was so happy to finally go here...i loved here and Disney sea...its just a whole new world...i have been around and traveled...but these places are one of my favorite...its so beautiful and unique here and you just seem to find this happy peace here....its so amazing...this is my happy place...you get to walk and talk and take everything in...from the sights and sounds and smells of the different foods in the vedors...i love it here...
1341,5,16-Mar,Australia,I feel like a 7 year old,"Loved it so so so so much. I have also been to Disneyland in California, U.S.A and this was as exciting an experience. My only negative was that the 'shows' were mostly in Japanese (which isn't a shock considering it is in Japan), just wasn't what I expected."
1342,5,16-Jul,Thailand,Welcome to the world of Fantasy,"I visited many  Disney theme parks, the Tokyo Disneyland is different because Japanese cast members are so polite and friendly. Furthermore, Japanese people are nice and have social concern. The park is so clean and nice. Meal and dessert are delicious. I really love this park."
1343,5,16-Jun,India,Fun day!!,Wonderland. Fantastic for a day trip. Rides are wonderful for medium level of thrill. Gone on weekdays still have to wait in queue. But locales are enjoying  among their groups even in the queue. Japanese are very polite asking us to come forward. Space station is wonderful so is the Indiana Jones ride. Parade was enjoying. I am a veggie so the food was hard to found for. They told us even the French fries were made with non veg oil. We have to manage with ice-cream!! But the Staff was co-operative. They even call the company to enquire about the oil.!!!! And then arrange for the ice cream. Try to reach early so that you can enjoy maximum rides. Enjoy there!!
1344,4,16-Mar,Australia,Worth trying if you haven't experienced Disneyland before.,"Being from Australia I had never been to a Disneyland before, so during my trip to Japan it was the perfect opportunity to experience one for myself. The scenery and gardens in this place were very impressive indeed. It was worth just spending a bit of time just to walk around and experience the level of detail that had gone into crafting the environment. Probably the only negative I really have of this place is all the lines and crowds that you have to contend with. If you want to try out some of the popular rides and avoid lining up for hours to do so they have a ticketing system available that you can ""pre-order""  your place in the line with. You will have to book these tickets in early as they will book out before long, but once you have these tickets you get given a time to come back to the rides, upon which you will pretty much get to the front of the queue straight away. Wish I had known this before coming as it would have been awesome to book our places in the queue while then having time to go and explore the park more. Anyway to get back to a positive again, pretty much all the food in this park is awesome. If you see any food vendors scattered about and want to try things out I highly recommend it. Unlike from what I hear about the American Disneylands the food here was also quite reasonably priced and was usually Disney themed in some way.Anyway I definitely recommend going here at least once. Just make sure you learn from my mistake and book your ride tickets early to avoid all the queuing up and you will maximise your experience."
1345,4,17-Jan,Australia,Enjoyed every minute,"Disneyland Tokyo compares favourably to the other Disneyland's we've been to (LA, Orlando, Hong Kong). Queues were manageable as the longest wait for us was 40 minutes - we visited on a weekday. We were told that on a more busy day fast passes would be advisable. The rides were enjoyable, exciting and our favourites were space mountain and big thunder mountain, which were the most exhilarating. Has heathy food options. "
1346,5,17-Jan,Indonesia,Disneyland,First experience for Disney ........ Nice and Good place for kids ........ We are having fun ........ Food also good ........
1347,4,17-Jan,United States,Not sure if it's worth it,"I was disappointed in our trip to Tokyo Disneyland. Granted, we went the day after New Year's. I checked the website and it was color coded red indicating it'll be super crowded....and it was.  The lines were super long for the rides except for the Merry Go Round and It's a Small World , which we rode. We stood in line for Pirates for about 25 minutes so that wasn't bad.  The lines for the popcorn were crazy long. (But we did stand in line and tried the curry popcorn - yum). There was some language confusion at the ticket booth. I thought I was purchasing a one-day pass ticket for both DisneySea and Disneyland but when we were exiting Disneyland to go to DisneySea, I asked one of the staff and she looked at my ticket and said I only bought a pass for Disneyland.  So we turned around and spent another several hours at Disneyland. The shops were busy but the lines went fast. I was looking for Tokyo Disneyland items as souveniers but there selection was small."
1348,5,16-Dec,Indonesia,Chilly at December!,Was very cold. Kids had a great time. Get used to queueing as it is a very busy park (the most lucrative of all Disney themeparks I think)
1349,4,17-Jan,N/A,Heaps of fun,Went to Disneyland with family for the day. We had a great time. The rides and attractions we saw were unreal and the detail was amazing. In the morning the waiting times were not bad but as the day progressed the lines got to a 50 minute wait. The food was fairly priced which suprised us. It was a pretty easy trip by train with the station was right out the front. I recommend splash mountain and jungle criuse. Overall was a great day out.
1350,2,16-Sep,India,Overhyped attraction as compared to USJ,This place was a highly recommend attraction to visit and hence took Wifey there for her birthday along with My 4 year old kid.Ended up having an OK time there as the rides did not really meet UpTo our expectation apart from Space mountain. The staff was friendly enough but the shows and the entire park experience is unashamedly tuned towards the female audience and hence my 4 year old got fidgety in a jiffy. I will admit that the castle is imposing and there are a lot ( and I really mean a lot compared to USJ) of things to do. But somehow we left the park feeling USJ was better.Maybe it was because of our link to the characters at Disney was not that strong.
1351,4,16-Dec,Australia,Fun day,"This was our first trip to any Disneyland so don't have much to compare it to. The day we went was raining so kept the crowds away (unlike our 2nd day at Disneysea which was packed!). Queues were fairly short for most of the rides. My tip would be too look at the map before going and go straight to those rides to either line up or get the fastpass. I'm guessing if you go first thing as soon as the park opens and on a weekday it would be quieter too! Food was ok, pretty average. The different popcorn flavoured stands were interesting. Lots of gift stores everywhere. Kids enjoyed the old time arcade.We managed to pay at the gate with our credit card but as previous reviewer mentioned our travel credit card wouldn't work there."
1352,5,16-Nov,Malaysia,Kids Favorite,You will not feel it is in Japan... very easy to travel from Tokyo Station.  Be there early Morning and stay until night if you have only 1 day visit...
1353,1,17-Jan,Australia,Fast Pass is a Trick!,"At about 1pm you are told that there is no more fast pass. You then have to queue for hours for rides that wouldn't tame a puppy. Millions of people all dressed in Disney crap. Food is appalling. Stores are all the same. Products are poor and highly priced. However, did not see any obese people in wheelchairs advancing to front of queue as in LA. Why oh why did we bother? Walt would turn in his grave!Dissapointed visitor"
1354,5,17-Jan,New Zealand,Excellent! ,"We went with our 2 1/2 year old. Couldn't fault it. The staff were so friendly and helpful. They loved kids!!! Food is what you would except, high sugar, fat and salt content. And on the pricey side. The rides we went on (with the toddler) were (mostly) fantastic. Pirates of the Caribbean - a tad dark but not too scaryMickey Mouse philharmonic - excellent! It's a small world - a tad crowded but has to be done. Merry go round Dumbo flying elephantJungle cruise - awesomeMark Twain cruiseThe midday parade was amazing but the nighttime light parade was next level. It was a huge day out for our toddler but well worth it!  "
1355,5,17-Jan,Australia,Best Day Ever!!,Had an absolute blast. Went on every ride. Yes there are lines but you can get fast passes for the most popular and Thunder Mountain has a single rider line which is a lot quicker. Make sure you pick your top preference to get fast passes for as you can generally only get one every 2 hours. Lots to see and do. One day was not enough!!
1356,5,16-Dec,Australia,Crowded even mid-week,"First time visiting Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea, overall it was awesome!! Been to DisneyLand and DisneyWorld many times in USA, and this was so similar yet so different at the same time.The highlights:- the AMAZING snacks including but not limited to: steamed shrimp buns shaped like mickey mouse, peculiar flavours of popcorn (curry, soy sauce etc), pizza spring rolls (our favourite)- the classic Disney rides: Star Tours + Pirate of the Caribbean (both never had a long line for some reason), Space Mountain and Splash Mountain. - the castle (even better than Disney World's castle)- the Christmas decorations were stunningBe warned:- we went in what was meant to be 'off peak' Tuesday-Thursday in early December, the crowds were still crazy. Check the online crowd calendar before booking a trip. Fast passes for the popular rides like Monsters Inc and Winnie the Pooh were gone for the entire day within an hour or two of park opening.- even during quiet periods, make sure you line up at the gate an hour before opening, I recommend getting a Monsters Inc Fastpass first then riding Winnie the Poo and Space Mountain straight away due to crowds!- if you stay for the entire day you can get most attractions done in the theme park. We made the mistake of doing the two theme parks over 3 days. I recommend one day per park unless you have kids or your visiting during peak season- Always know when the parades are scheduled and the route of the parades. At some point you WILL get STUCK in a particular area due to a parade. For some reason EVERYONE watches the parades. Once the parades start, you cannot get to the opposite side of the parade route for maybe 20-30 minutes. We almost couldn't use our fastpass for the Haunted Mansion even though we were 10 metres away from the ride (on the opposite side of the parade route). - people don't wear ponchos on Splash Mountain, even in the middle of winter? (very different to Disney in USA)- If you are staying at a hotel on the monorail, I recommend getting the multi-day monorail pass as you will find yourself using it a lot. - There are large lockers outside of the park, suitable for our carry-on suitcase and backpack on our first day.- The rides and shows are mainly in Japanese, no English subtitles.- We COULD NOT USE OUR TRAVEL CARD to buy our tickets at the gate, international travellers, bring LOTS of cash. The only place to take out money on our Australian travel card was 7/11 ATM at Akihabara (Downtown Disney)Overall, it was a very fun trip!"
1357,1,16-Dec,Australia,"You would queue for one hour just for Popcorn, please don't waste your time & money","in Japan and where is public holiday, don't dare to go any public places because there are queues everywhere and you will get no value of the money you pay.1 hour waiting for popcorn, 2 hours waiting for proper ride, half an hour to buy water, half an hour to go to the toilet.they are just so many of them and you get to do nothing, expensive and terrible! "
1358,5,16-Feb,Falkland Islands,Returning this year,"Fantastic place to visit with family or even by yourself, we liked it so much that we are visiting again in March of this year. Love Japan and Disneyland must see."
1359,5,16-Feb,Taiwan,Childhood Dream,The place bring different kind of joy to me and my daughter. Creates a wonderful memory for us as family. We Love Disney!
1360,5,16-Dec,Costa Rica,Go as early as possible,"This is a really beautiful and big park. It¬¥s very crowded, but if you arrive early in the morning you will be able to ride almost every atracction. Be prepared to long waiting times."
1361,4,17-Jan,Philippines,Very Crowded,The place was very crowded during the holidays that we spent more time queuing up for hours than enjoying the attractions to the fullest during our stay. We dined at the Queen of Hearts Dining Hall after lining up for an hour and 1/2. Food was excellent and service was admirable as the crew were efficient enough to serve us right away and even helped in carrying our food tray to an available table. We enjoyed the story of Cinderella a lot more with the props that they have placed inside the castle including a cushioned glass slipper that you can try on for size and a throne where one can sit momentarily for a souvenir shot.
1362,5,17-Jan,N/A,Childhood dream ticked off,"I loved this place. As crazy packed as it was, just living that childhood dream was an amazing feeling. The castle that I see on every Disney movie I've seen was right in front of me. The rides have long wait lines but that's to be expected. It's Disneyland! All rides have ""fast pass"" however. You can actually fast track your wait times in line by attaining a fast pass (free and for the ride only) which allows you to venture off somewhere else and return to the ride at the allocated time. DO NOT miss the light parade at night time. It was phenomenal! And the light display with fireworks over the castle was crazy cool. Wait line for food was daily long but moved considerably well and was sooo yum! Far better than any of the warner bros parks on the Gold Coast. You can't say you've been to Tokyo without experiencing Disneyland."
1363,5,16-Dec,Malaysia,Magic and Disney,This is the first time to visit this place. Still find it a magical place with so many things to do. The rides was fun but expected the long Que.
1364,5,16-Dec,Australia,Amazing!!! Very well organised and enjoyable!!!,"If you want to really enjoy Disneyland, I recommend you do these three things: download 'Waiting Time' app, check 'Tokyo Disneyland Crowd Calendar' before booking hotel, stay in Tokyo Disneyland resort in one of the hotels. I stayed in Hilton. If you do these three things, you will enjoy it immensely!!!"
1365,5,16-Aug,Taiwan,Â•≥Â≠©ÁöÑÂ§¢ÊÉ≥,I really love every Disney in the world.Tokyo Disney is my favorite disney land!The souvenirs are cutest than other disney land.
1366,5,16-Dec,United States,A smaller version of Disney World,"This was really a smaller version of Disney World with a Japanese twist.  For those who are already familiar with Disney World, best to try rides which are unique to this particular park, for example Monster, Inc Ride & Go Seek - which is appropriate for younger kids.  Buzz Lightyear ride was good as the blasters are on a cord instead of connected to the seat.  Please note that rides such as Star Tours and shows are in Japanese and nuances may be slightly loss.  The haunted house was a neat experience during Christmas as it is completely modified for the holiday experience.  "
1367,5,17-Jan,United States,Indeed the happiest place on earth!!!!,Took our niece and nephew to Disneyland Tokyo. Our first time at this Disneyland as well. We all enjoyed the trip specially the two little ones. 
1368,5,16-Mar,N/A,Have a magical day!,"Here is the place where dreams come true!! My family and I always go there every times we visit Tokyo! We love to spend all day and night here, especially nigh time watching the stunning firework, parade and show! The staffs are very friendly. Tokyo disneyland merchandises always get the money out from my pocket.. LOL"
1369,5,16-Jun,Singapore,It's the Happiest Place On Earth.,"If you have to choose between Disneyland or DisneySea, I will say Disneyland. Having been to Universal Studios, I'm pleasantly surprised that Disneyland provides complementary ""fast pass"". If you made use of the fast pass, you will definitely be able to complete all the rides within a day! I got a fast pass for the Monster Inc ride first thing I got into the park and proceeded to queue for the rest. You can get your next fast pass in 2 hours or until the timing of the first pass is over. I love the vibe at Disneyland as everything is simply so magical! And the food at the restaurants actually taste decent! Every corner is a surprise! So go there and let the kid in you be release and enjoy yourself!"
1370,5,16-Dec,United States,Its was great,Bought our tickets at the Hilton Tokyo Bay.  Arrived an hour before opening.  Lots of people in line sitting quietly.  People literally run to get their FP.  We're able to ride all the rides we wanted too.  We went Dec 20 2016.  We ate at the Alice Wonderland Restaurant had 1/2 small chicken set meal ~1500Y.  Good deal compared to other amusement parks we had gone too.  Free water sprouts at the restaurant.  Clean park and bathrooms.  Poohs Hunny Hunt ride really good.  All rides are in Japanese.  Don't do the Stitch Encounter if you don't understand the language.
1371,4,16-May,Australia,Tick off my bucketlist. ,To have one of my daughter celebrate her birthday in Disneyland. So happy i ticked this off my list. My daughter was given a birthday sticker placed on her dress and all staff who we pass by greets her wvery time. It was tiring as the area was huge but definitely worth visiting. The best part was their lights show before closing time instead of their usual fireworks display. Just amazing! We all left with contented hearts and big smiles. 
1372,5,16-Dec,N/A,"Happiness is here, suitable for all ages","Better do some research on their official website before going so that you can know more about their services. I went there on 31 Dec, I'd day it was a good timing as most Japanese have gone back to their hometown to celebrate the new year (and the traffic was smooth too). I've tried 6 attractions within 7 hours using 2 times fastpass. Take note that you can use your park ticket to go to selected fastpass stations to get it, it'll provide a time range that you can come back for the attraction, you can use your extra time to queue for those attractions that don't provide fastpass. Rmb to check the fastpass as you'll be able to see when's the next time you can get another fastpass (and better go get the first fastpass when you enter). The parade is a must watch, it blends all kinds of happiness no matter what's your age. You can reserve seats at the side of the parade route. The park and toilets are very clean, and is wheelchair friendly, you can even rent a Disney-themed wheelchair. Pets can be kept in their pet club. The staffs are very friendly too. Some attractions have background story are only in Japanese (but gladly their park guide has eng version), which I can't understand as a foreigner, but it's still a wonderful experience. "
1373,5,16-Aug,United States,"As they say, resistance is futile.  If I must take the kids to Disney, I'll do it in Japan.","I haven't been to Disneyworld in Orlando since it opened in 1970 or so and kind of never want to go back.  However, I was pleasantly happy at Disney Tokyo. It's kookier than Orlando bc it is Japan and everything there is a bit kooky.  We had a typhoon on day 2, trees were felled by the wind, but the park just kept on chugging along with smiles and toots and parades.  It was surreal, to say the least."
1374,5,16-Sep,Italy,A lifetime memory,"I am a huge Disney fan, to be precise, I visited several Disney parks around the globe but this will remain in my heart.. It has all the attractions you expect from a Disney park but with the kindness of Japanese people and staff. Unluckily there were also huge lines for some attractions that we skipped, but if you have more time than I did you can well organize your time and see and try everything in one or maybe one and half day. The food was good and with different dining options, the souvenirs were nice and the price not too expensive, the experience simply magic and dreamy.."
1375,5,16-Jul,United Kingdom,A whole new look on Disney!,"We are HUGE disney world fans, and we were very excited to try a new Disney. We were only in Tokyo for a week, but the Disney parks were MUSTS for us! Tokyo Disneyland is similar to Magic Kingdom, yet so so different. Rides include space mountain, pirates of the Caribbean (a better version), haunted mansion and splash mountain. However, unlike magic kingdom, the park introduces new experiences. Such as Poohs Hunny Hunt (brilliant, would highly recommend), Monster Inc Hide and Go Seek (worth a fast pass) and a new Main Street (covered by a roof, and offers new and exciting shops). Food wise, we ate at Crystal Palace, a Magic Kingdom favourite. This buffet offered a good selection of western food (as well as some non-western food) for a good price (for an all you can eat buffet). Throughout the day, the park was quieter than the Florida equivalent (we went during low season however). Would recommend grabbing fast passes for rides such as Poohs Hunny Hunt, Monsters Inc and Space Mt. As far as parades and shows go, there was lots going on! If you are in Tokyo, and enjoy Disney parks/theme parks, you MUST go here. "
1376,4,16-May,Taiwan,Sea Place is not my type,Lots of cuties in the land and staffs there are always wearing a warming smile and willing to help.But the sea land is a bit board and will for adults only per my opinion. The characters there are really not my type and not caused me any interesting.Will like to coming back and see Winnie the Pooh again!!
1377,4,16-Dec,Australia,Great Day!,"Spent New Year's Eve at Disneyland Tokyo. Had expectations of an extremely packed park with lots of waiting. Managed most of the key rides with the longest wait of 40 mins. Word of advice, fast pass is a must if you only have one day. Zipped past lines and knocked off around an hour of waiting on three rides at least. This allowed us to fit way more in. Food is expensive and not healthy but the sweet potato pastry things from one of the hut things was a yummy surprising treat. Don't throw your water bottles away as there are water fountains do fill up all over the park and it's hard to find water otherwise. Very clean and the cast members are so nice and helpful. Try and get there at open and plan your hit list for rides and attractions. Sore feet & legs but happy with the day overall. "
1378,4,16-Jan,Egypt,Finally! Disneyland,"I think it is everyone's dream to go to Disneyland. Tokyo Disneyland is a magical place where you feel like you are part of the fairytale. It is well organized and equipped with hundreds of stores that makes you want to buy everything. I loved it. On the other side, I think it is so small with limited highlighted rides. That makes the waiting time unbearable 90+ minutes. You should go prepared that you won't be able to go to all the rides in one day. Simply because there is too much people for every ride. And the dilemma is it is not really worth it to visit it for 2 days!"
1379,1,16-Dec,Canada,Don't bother.  Completely overcrowded.,"Disney cares more about packing them in than it does about providing a nice experience. Way too many people for the place to handle. They really need to cap You shouldn't have to wait 4.5 hours for any ride (with no fast passes available) nor should you have to wait 40 minutes to get a popcorn or 30 minutes to use a toilet. It was an extremely long wait for all the popular rides and even the kiddie ones had between a 30-75 minute wait. They need to manage the number of people they let into this place or add more bathrooms, restaurants, snack vendors and rides to balance things out. My advice would be to stick to the parks in the US. The ones in Japan pale in comparison and are a waste of time. Nothing unique about them except that they are vastly inferior when it comes to the overall experience. For whatever reason the locals don't seem to mind lining up for hours for everything. I wish Disney would refund me my money. My kids got on only three rides."
1380,5,16-Apr,Croatia,Visit in the spring,"Tokyo Disneyland follows the format of the other disneylands, that is a Main Street with shops, a magic castle and different lands going outwards.  The biggest difference you notice on arrival is the Disney characters standing outside the park giving autographs and having your picture taken.  On the day I chose to count there were 27 characters - you certainly feel the magic of the characters before you even have entered with the children getting very excited. Included were characters not often seen in this scenario.Once in the next big diference is what the shops are selling.  All the normal Disney clothing and souvenirs but...  sweets and biscuits.  I have never seen before or since so may Disney branded edibles.  Apparently it is because taking presents home and to work features highly in the Japanese culture.The rides were similar to the US, but the space was very different - loads of it and a long walk to the castle and the different lands.  This was my second visit and every bit as good as the first time with spectacular fireworks as the finale for the day."
1381,1,16-Dec,Australia,Disney you should be ashamed of yourselves,"Visited with our 2 kids today, 28 December. Terrible. Queues were ridiculous. We only got 3 rides in. Even queues for popcorn were 30 minutes. There were clearly too many people in the park. Very disappointed with Disney who are clearly prioritising revenue over customer service. Avoid."
1382,5,16-Dec,Malaysia,One of the Best Disneyland around the World,"I have been visited most of the Disneyland around the world. (Except the Florida and Shanghai) one. But Japan Tokyo Disneyland is one of the best in term of parade, shopping experience and food quality. The only thing is, the waiting time for the popular ride is quite long if no fastpass like the Winnie the Pooh story and Haunted House.Small small world basically is no queue at all. Just 5 minutes will be your turn.Fun place for family with young kids...:)"
1383,1,16-Dec,Australia,Me and a million of my best mates ,"I have been to Disney land in the states and loved it and was super excited to tick off the next Disney land on my bucket list. My favourite rides were all there so was keen to try them all again. In 5hours we did 3 kids rides (boat cruise, train and star was simulation ride). We left the happiest place on earth disappointed. I would only recommend doing this if you have lots of time in Tokyo or get there super early in the morning and get your fast passes early as they do shut around 2pm. In saying all this the staff there were so so lovely and you honestly couldn't say a word wrong about them. This park would be amazing if the crowds were capped as no one wants to wait in line for 2.5 hours in a line ...."
1384,4,16-Dec,Singapore,Crowded,"We went on Thursday and it was super crowded like the Disneysea. Everywhere is long q. Average waiting time at least 60mins. Some rides took shorter like the small small world as the q moved very fast as they used many boats.The kids were disappointed as there were limited rides due to long waiting time and because its winter, sky turns dark really early.Didn't manage to take many rides as planned. Adults are disappointed as well."
1385,4,16-Dec,Australia,Ageing but still worth a visit,Some of the rides are noticeably ageing (in terms of look and feel) but they have rides not available in other Disney parks.
1386,5,16-Dec,Philippines,Loved the Tokyo Disneyland and its Christmas parade!,"After reading so many gripes and complaints about the horrible long lines, my expectation on visiting tokyo disneyland is actually very low, specially since our visiting date is on December 22, few days away from Christmas. What a pleasant surprise it is that each ride took us less than 20 minutes (yes! less than 20 minutes EACH ride)! I was awestruck! Also, the food is decent albeit pricey. But that's expected.Had a total of 6 rides for the day and didn't use any fast pass, including small world, pirates, and peter pan. For It's a small world, the 1st time we went there is literally no line! Wonder if we just lucked out or what. Longest line queuing we did was for peter pan flight and that took us less than 20 minutes! I was so amazed!We had 2 kids with us and parents so by 5pm they are all tired already and suggested to leave, but if it were up to me, i would've stayed until closing time. The lines are definitely what made me so happy, it was fast and moving and completely nothing similar at all to what I've been reading. Cannot understand why is that since we visited on December, and even on a date close to Christmas! Maybe we are just lucky :)Saw 2 parades, 1st is Disney Princess, 2nd is the Christmas Theme parade with Frozen and Beauty & the Beast. Very nice! Bathrooms are also well-maintained but this is standard in Japan anyway. The weather is perfect too- cold wind but sun is very bright. I did not wear my jacket until the evening as it's manageable. Skip the shops, not worth it. As for everything else, my advise is GO! Have a great magical time! We certainly did."
1387,3,16-Dec,Australia,Very Busy,Attended on Christmas Day thinking crowds would be less.  Very difficult to get on a ride. Would recommend if available pre purchase of Fast Pass tickets otherwise impossible to get on the rides.
1388,4,16-Dec,Singapore,Great ride but long queue,First time to Tokyo disneyland and the tried to queue for the first ride of Pirates of Caribbean and took 10 min only. Happily queue at the 2nd ride of Thunder mountain and it stated the queue time is 50 min. So we queue and it last almost 2 hours!!!But the ride is thrilling!!!  must say the length of the ride is unusually long and worth is the wait. Others ride queuing time is too long (50 - 80 min). Managed to take the ride of Space adventure ( queue for 10 min only) and it was fun and exciting.Seems like there were more Japanese than the tourists. Advise to buy FastPass if you can afford so to cut the queuing time.
1389,5,16-Dec,Indonesia,Beautiful parks with many show,"Truly magnificent park, unfortunately we come in such high season so queing is unbelievable, will visit again soon"
1390,5,16-Apr,Indonesia,"Fun, friendly people, easy to access from city","We traveling on group of 6 people this time and plenty adventure to try but unfortunetly we go on the weekend which is many Japanese family go with their family member also, we just only rides 2 game, best time to visit on end of march to oct (imho) This area also can access by japan subway and the ticket price around 50-55 usdCheers"
1391,3,16-Dec,United States,Children themed,"If you're someone who wants to go here for awesome rides, the only thing thrilling are three rides located in different places. Granted we went there a little bit late so we didn't have much time to look around. I feel like this park was definitely smaller than the one compared to the US. All in all, Tokyo Disneyland is merely for children who wants to enjoy the wonderful world of Disney with child-friendly rides. I heard Tokyo Disneysea is more adult-themed. Eitherway family, friends, and lovers enjoy the whole park."
1392,5,16-Dec,N/A,Must go,"The place was full of dreams and funs.The staffs was nice and helpful.We lost our hat but easily can found at ""lost and found"". They seen like having a ground of people to taking care those things lost during we have fun at the park. "
1393,4,16-Nov,United States,Crowded but organized,"People were so polite and delightful at the park. Regardless of the crowds the staff must have a masters in people control because it was downright organized. As long as you can follow directions you will get your turn.  It was nice to see the subtle differences that this park had to offer over the US parks.  Just go with the flow, it's all magical."
1394,4,16-Dec,Japan,Excellent except for food,"Tokyo Disneyland is amazing. The service is excellent. The rides are fun. Every visitor is virtually guaranteed a wonderful experience. The one major feature that is lacking, is the quality of the food, which is very poor and lacking in variety. The terrible food selection stands out, especially in a country where excellent food is on offer virtually everywhere else.You will love Tokyo Disneyland, but I would suggest eating outside of the park, at one of the many restaurants near the park's train station; a bit inconvenient, but necessary."
1395,5,16-Dec,Singapore,"Two days,nothing less ","Was there on a one-day expedition. Alarm went off at 6am, wash up and breakfast all by 7.30am and out of the apartment by 0800hr. We wanted to be there as the gates open at 0900hrs. Good lord- the whole world was there at 9 too. It is one of those pilgrimage when you are in Tokyo WITH kids/teens. Minus an hour max for sitting to eat - my legs have been working all day from 9am to 10pm. Even the most experience female shoppers need legs of steel to survive and complete Disney in one day.Bottom line - don't bother if you can't afford two days here. It's just tiring to attempt this in one day. Unless you are absolutely sure that the world won't be there. Nonetheless the kids loved it!"
1396,4,16-Dec,N/A,As good as any Disney outlet,"Enjoyed a lovely time with my family in Tokyo's happiest place on earth, Disney land..highly recommended to visit for fun and leasure.."
1397,5,16-Dec,India,I feel like a kid again,"If one has kids or if one feels like a kid, then it is a must to visit Tokyo Disneyland! This place is understandably packed with people, especially on weekends and holidays, so planning one's day is crucial! Getting there early is also crucial! So read up on the park, what events that might occur during your visit, what rides to take, when to eat, how long to shop, etc.. in order to make the most out of your visit!"
1398,4,16-Jul,United States,Can't Go Wrong With Disneyland,"Tip: Go early to stand in line to get the fast pass for the rides you want.  Since it was raining, we were able to ride all the rides we wanted and got fast passes for everything.  Since we had an early flight home, we were able to do everything we wanted to do at Disneyland and leave the park by 2pm."
1399,5,16-Aug,N/A,One of the best day of my life,"Once you entered, seeing Cinderella's castle for the first is really magical. The rides are all awesome. Parade and shows were amazing. Food are quite expensive but their cute so... :) this is a place I really want to go back to."
1400,5,16-Dec,N/A,Two Days Of Fun In Disneyland,"We bought 2-day tickets to Disneyland for weekdays 30th Nov and 1st Dec. Please check the theme park opening hours before purchasing. On 2nd Dec, Friday, the park closed at 6pm instead of usual 10pm! Tips - Plan for weekday trips, buy tickets online and you must print out them out, go for fastpass machines first to get fastpass tickets, bring a floor mat if you intend to sit down & watch the parade Nearest station is Maihama. After exit from station (south exit I think), turn right to Disneyland (turn left to Disneysea). Take a brief 7 mins walk (no covered shelter) to the Disneyland checkpoint (where they check your bags). Along the way, you will pass by a huge Disney store in case you miss out any souvenirs. Remember to grab the theme park map and show attraction timing (same booklet) after you enter the attraction gates (after scanning the park tickets). The booklets are located on top of the exit/entry gates and it comes with Japanese/English/Chinese. All show attractions are spoken in Japanese, but will include a few English conversations/songs. Probably due to Christmas season, they sold Turkey drumsticks as snacks along the street. Besides attractions, you can go for side adventure, popcorn hunting. There are six different types of popcorn over the theme park; Soy Sauce & Butter, Caramel, Curry, Salted, Milk Chocolate and Honey. Or you can go on medallion coins hunt. These medallion machines are located in restaurants and souvenir shops and they change the pictures of these medallions (¬•100) everyday. Overall, our family enjoyed the entire theme park that we stayed up until the park closes. The staff are always in smile and always glad to answer your questions. Be sure to take photos together with Mickey!"
1401,4,16-Dec,Singapore,It's a pity that the firework was cancelled due to bad weather,"Definitely a must visit to embrace yourself in the magical moment of Disney, you can easily spend the whole day and find yourself unable to cover the entire park. The place was already crowded from opening hour till closing hour, be prepared to brave through the crowd and long queue to enjoy the ride, and not forgetting squeezing through the human crowd in the shops."
1402,4,16-Dec,N/A,Disneyland Tokyo,"Like all Disneyland park, this place is magical from the moment you enter the gates. We visited during Christmas time so everything was Christmas themed which made it even more magical. The parades at different times during the day was great & a perfect opportunity for families with kids to rest.We love how a lot of the locals dresses up which adds to the spirit of the place.All the park staff are friendly & helpful."
1403,4,16-Dec,N/A,Where dreams are made ,"Is Disneyland! Where could you wrong? Was slightly disappointed that all the real ""restaurants"" (with table service) needed online booking and reservations in order to eat there, so we were forced to eat at the kiosks and ""cafeteria"" style places, which to be fair wasn't an issue because the food was delicious! Getting FastPasses ASAP  is essential for the big rides. However when you have 1, you have to wait 3 hours to use it and wait 2 hours before you can get another fast pass.Other than that! It was excellent! "
1404,5,16-Dec,Malaysia,Fantasyland for Children ,Probably one of the most friendliest theme park of the world but not cheap. To save some money I bought some food (sandwiches) from FamilyMart and brought there to eat. But still spent some thousands of Yen for popcorn and the turkey stick (highly recommend).
1405,5,16-Nov,N/A,Tokyo Disneyland ,Tokyo Disneyland is near the CBD and you can catch the train which is cheaper than taxi. You should get there early in the morning and try to get on as many rides as you can because the waiting time for each of the rides is almost about an hour. 
1406,5,16-Oct,N/A,FUN TO BE HERE,"Amazing rides, cleanliness greetings and guide. For some rides you have to queue but using the fast track passes its quite easy to board the rides. The Thunder mountain , Space mountain must experience. All the Parades are amazing to see. Fun to be there all the time."
1407,3,16-Nov,Japan,Crowded! Crowded! Crowded!,"All I can say is that if you are going, expect VERY LONG lines and at least a 90 to 180 minute wait for each attraction.  I would not recommend going if you have really young children under 2 years old.  They won't care or remember, and all it will do is serve to tire you out even quicker.Let me emphasize again, expect long lines, and that's for everything: attractions (90-180 minutes at least) , restaurants (varies, but about 60 minutes for the shortest wait), concession stands (60 minute wait for popcorn), and...yes restrooms (expect 30 minutes), picture with characters (an hour if you are lucky).  Weekends and holidays are absolutely chaotic.  Avoid it you can.  At times, the park will close admissions it the park gets too crowded.As much as I like Tokyo Disneyland, it does attracts a lot of immature ""adults"" who would happily shove your 3 year old aside in line just to get a picture with Mickey.  Because of this, the crowds, and extremely long lines and long wait time, I would not bring very small children.  Its just not worth.  Wait until they are old enough to understand where they are and enjoy the rides."
1408,5,16-Dec,Indonesia,Wonderful theme park,"This park very wonderful and make everybody happyI have some advise to entry this park1. Check the weather condition for your planning time. Avoid rainy time or bring rain coat or umvrella2. Check the show and attraction schedule because sometime they have regurarly maitenance activity. Daily open time are different for every season3. Entry the park in the morning and back home 10minutes before last show to avoid long Q for train or taxi if use public transportation4. Get the map and show shedule to make the itinerary plan5. Get lottery and fastpass as much as you xan to save your time and avoid long Q6. Make restaurant reservation or take your lunch/dinner before/after lunch/dinner time to avoid long Q and limitation seati hv experience when joint at Polynesian terrace. There is Mickey Mouse show when we take our dinner for 1hour offer there. The price quite expensive but if compare with the show i think the price is fair.... they offer dinner for set menu (appetizer, main course and dessert) . The taste very delicious"
1409,4,16-Dec,Singapore,Best Disneyland park in Asia,"Why the best:- The orderliness of the queues.  If you have been to the one in Hong Kong where grown-up men and women cut the queue for Flying Dumbo, you will love Disney Japan.  - Very helpful Disney staff.  For reviewers who encountered bad attitude from some, please do not assume all are Japanese.  Even name tags can be deceiving.  Besides, these reviewers should visit the parks in LA and Orlando to truly appreciate the staff in Tokyo.- Very clean and well maintained grounds and toilets, despite the crowds.- The dress-up and ambience: The Japs really kit up in Disney gear when they visit, grown-ups, teenagers alike.  It really adds to the atmosphere.Tip: Avoid the weekends and holidays to make your visit less stressful.  Queuing hours for a two-five minute ride is no fun.  But you already know this, yeah?"
1410,5,16-Nov,N/A,LOVED!,"We are seasoned disney world family and we just fell in love with tokyo disney ! the popcorn was amazing , the food overall was an experience  on its own ! the park was extremely clean and the staff was so warm and friendly . the park does get crowded but if you go early and get fast pass you should be fine."
1411,5,16-Dec,Indonesia,Recommended for family vacations,There are lots of restaurants and a big variety of food to choose from. There are plenty of rides as well and the majority of them are suitable for young children. There are many giftshops as well to buy souvenirs. 
1412,5,16-Dec,Malaysia,1 day is not enough,"If you want to play all of the attractions, take pictures, 1 day is not enough. You need to spend at least 1 - 1 1/2 day. Im was with my 11 years old son & 5 years old daughter. Disneyland is just perfect for them instead of Disney sea. They can play almost all the attraction. Waiting time during holiday season (in december) is still acceptable. From 10 minutes - 2 hours. For those with 1 hour ++, fast pass can be obtain. So no big deal about it. They have various flavour of popcorn, so don't forget to try each of them. Each park has it's own theme & the popcorn also various according to the theme park. Exciting! Food price is around 300 yen - 2000 yen. But it is not applicable for those food sold from the restaurant. If you are muslim visitor, bring your own food & keep it inside storage locker. When it is lunch @ dinner time, the queue to the restaurant is super looonnnnggg! Don't waste time queuing up. Go out, take your lunch & eat it at the picnic area. So you can save your time. In terms of drinking water. Just bring empty bottle. There is free drinking water inside which later you can topup inside your empty bottle. If it's time to buy souvenir, just go the Grand Emporium. They have almost all the items. Easy."
1413,5,16-Dec,Singapore,The best one ,I had the chance to visit all the Disney Parks existing at the moment ... and for me this one was my favourite one ... even crowder for Xmas it was ok ... for the main attractions it was only 45 to 60 mns wait ... the staff is not really fluent in English but what ??? We are in Japan ! So we have to accept their culture and that's it ... the park is super clean as well ...Do not miss the parades ... specially the Xmas one and the electrical one ... The fireworks is ok but little compared to Orlando ...We left After the fireworks it tools us 45 mns to join the station and being back home at Ginza ... I think it was very quick ! It's very easy !
1414,5,16-Dec,United States,A must see ,Probably one of the best family experiences we have had in Tokyo! The park was full of activities that kept everyone happy from open to close. It was also some of the best laser light shows and fireworks I've seen in Japan.
1415,4,16-Dec,N/A,Not just the happiest place on earth but the most thrilled,"I just thought it's just Mickey and friends but it's more than that! Hey I have Indiana Jones, Journey at the Center of the Earth and Arielle's acrobatic skills. Arrived almost lunch and left around 8 in the evening but my heart is filled with inspiration and this place reminds me of who I was when I was a kid. "
1416,5,16-Dec,N/A,"Good fun, but crowded at Christmas","My friends and I arrived at 9am the Sunday before Christmas, and we knew it would be crowded. However, we could only get one Fast Pass with a return time before the park closed (we got it as soon as we arrived, allowing us to go on Space Mountain at 12:30, but if we got any fast passes after that, the earliest return time was 9:30pm).All other rides had a varying wait time from 15 minutes to over 2 hours. After getting some food, watching the day and night parade, we probably ride a total of 5 rides in 12 hours.Still a lot of fun, but it was definitely crowded.(And if you're going to go to a foreign theme park, don't be the stubborn foreigner and demand your native language or bring a credit card. Provide cash and at least learn some basic phrases, like ""please"", ""thank you"", and ""excuse me"". There were a lot of foreigners there that were the stereotypical ""I'm a foreigner, adapt for me! I'm your customer, bend over backwards to please me!"" kind of attitude, giving the foreigners who live here (like me and my friends) a bad impression.)"
1417,4,16-Dec,N/A,More for kids,"This park is a lot more for kids. If you want ride for teenagers or adult, go to disneysea instead. Howe, if you have young kids this is definitely the place to go! "
1418,2,16-Dec,N/A,Poor staff attitude,"This is our second visit to Tokyo Disneyland. Overall, the rides are great. But the visit was marred by poor staff attitude. It is surprising that for an international chain, the staff speaks very poor English. Hence, it takes effort to understand what they are trying to say. It is frustrating when you asked them questions.The other point to note is that they can be inconsistent in their answers. When we were standing at the side walk for the electric light show, we were told that the back row is only for standing. But when observed that other Japanese were sitting, I asked the staff why that is so, I was told patrons can either sit or stand! The staff are also impatient when they have to converse with you in English. So don't expect the typical courteous Japanese service attitude. Will I visit this park again, unlikely. I will instead visit Disney Sea as I find the staff attitude and the rides in that park gives me a better overall experience."
1419,3,16-Dec,United States,Way too busy,"I am a huge Disney fan that have been to all but one Disney in the world.  This was my least favorite.  Upon arrival just trying to find the location where the tickets are sold was impossible.  The lines just to get in were so long that the ticket booths were hidden.  When I finally got in people were pushing and it was not relaxing, and at 8:15 people were already lining the streets for the parades so it was difficult to get any nice photos.  One hour after the park opened every ride had over 100 minute wait.  It was insane.  All other Disney parks were so clean however this was not.  Considering everything in Japan was super neat and tide this was disappointing."
1420,5,16-Sep,Indonesia,I've never getting old for Disney!,"(+) The happiest place on earth! (+) The most wonderful (imagination) life feels like becoming true. (+) The most uniqueness and delicious foodies. (+) The helpful officer around.But,(-) The price offered is quite expensive (7400 yen).(-) Rides are always long queues and spend time.(-) Need more than 4-5 hours to explore Disneyland.(-) Unfortunately, the price of tickets sold for Disneyland not apply to Disney sea."
1421,5,16-Apr,Singapore,Disney,I spent around $2000 (SIN) as I bought stuff for my nieces & nephew & also for myself. I didn't really take the rides as it was packed with people so I just walked around & enjoyed the view. Very magical feel to it.
1422,4,16-Dec,Australia,Master the fast pass system ,"And get there early.  If you are staying at the Disney hotel have a hotel break after lunch and return for dinner and the night session. This avoids peak crowds. Disney sea is better, but Disneyland is exactly like Anaheim in CA, USA. Just not the same vibe of American  culture and customer service - we preferred the US one better. Lots of Japanese girls dressed the same and an overdose of Disney apparel - but very true to the original, just don't expect anything different or more Asian. Our kids preferred Disney sea. "
1423,2,16-Dec,Indonesia,Great place with poor staff,We purchase the ticket online and end left our printed ticket on the train. We ask three staff on where to print the ticket and all those three staff said we dont know we dont know we dont know. It doesnt help us and we ask this question to guest information counter. HufhPlace are nice though. I believe there will be people who confuse like us in the future. We ended up find hotel near by to ask their assistance.
1424,5,16-Apr,Canada,Tokyo Disney excellent experience,"Except for the rain that day, had an excellent time at Tokyo Disney.  The design of the different sections is laid out like Disneyland California so very easy to get around.  Also, not as huge as Orlando.  There are fewer attractions than California though, more spacing between rides, and attraction size is larger taking up more property.  Found a little caf√© to eat in the Grande Bazaar which is similar to Main Street with shops and restaurants.  Adventures of Winnie the Pooh has a fast pass option because it's really popular here.  It is a 5 minute walk-on in California.  Disney's Phillharmagic from Orlando is here, but was closed which would've been good on the rainy day.  There is Bear Country Jamboree here, but slightly different.  New Star Tours video had been installed by April 2016 when I visited.  Rode twice and had different video playing each time.  The train only goes between 2 lands instead of around the entire park.  You have to pay a fee to take the monorail outside of the park to get to Disney Hotels & Disney Sea.  There is no monorail inside the parks.  There is a subway station on property for trains going back to Tokyo.  Travel time from Tokyo is around 1hr.  Tickets can be bought at Disney Stores for a discounted price or at the park.  Also, at the subway station electronic ticket dispensers upon arrival on Disney property  Cinderella's castle has displays and storybooks on Cinderella inside just like Disneyland used to have the Sleeping Beauty display inside the castle there.  Jungle Cruise, Big Thunder Mountain, Splash Mountain (not for rainy day),  were much larger scale than Disneyland.  Pirates of the Caribbean was closed at the time.  There are also more shops and eateries than in some of the other Disney Parks.  There is also a show after the fireworks show where portions of Disney classics are displayed on the castle along with background music.  This was very well done and entertaining.  Just remember all shows and parades are in the country's native language.   Also, there are lines throughout the day.  So try to come early to beat the crowds.  Overall, I had a very enjoyable time at Tokyo Disney and would recommend visiting while in Japan.  "
1425,5,16-Dec,Singapore,Relatively short queues on a Tuesday,"We were there on a Tuesday and arrived about 45 mins before the park was open. The queues were long and became much longer while we waited to enter the park. It didn't take us long to enter the park after opening.The first thing we did after entering the park is to get the fast pass for Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters and we managed to get the 1130 am slots. Then we went over to Monsters, Inc. Ride & Go Seek! and queued for about 15 mins for our first ride.After the ride, we went to reserve table for our lunch at Restaurant Hokusai and got the 1:30 pm slot. Between reserving and having lunch, we managed to take two other rides (each about 5 minutes queue) and watched the Christmas Parade.All together, we did 14 rides in Disneyland (including twice for Monster Inc). Our longest queue time is Monster Inc where we queued 45 minutes after 7 pm.Dinner was settled hastily as many people were in the restaurants after sunset.Didn't catch the fireworks as it was cancelled due to weather reasons."
1426,5,16-Dec,Indonesia,Fun fun fun,"My kids enjoyed their time and had so much fun. Easy transportation since this japan tho, will come back again earlier to took more fast pass."
1427,5,16-Dec,Taiwan,Professionally run.  Great parade.  Still many things to do even my daughter is only 1.5 yr old.,"Watched all the parades (2 day time + 1 night time) and my 1.5 yr old daughter enjoys it so much.  It's the 1st Disney for her and I think we made the right choice.It's big but not too big.  Everyone with babies would understand what I am saying.The night firework is ""modified"" to be a light projection show on the sleeping beauty castle, which is very good as well.  Worth to stay in the Disney hotels (including partners hotel like Hilton, Sheraton, etc.) because lots of travelling time will be saved, and one need NOT to rush back home/ hotel in downtown.  For us, we stayed till 10pm so that we can took the NEW Winnie the Pooh ride twice before leaving the park (day time waiting time 45min)."
1428,5,16-Dec,India,A must see,No words can express the fun nature of this world. For people with Children this is like a shrine that you need to visit.It's a two-day affair with Disney but if you are constrained by time then ensure that you use fast pass prudently.Tip: Use fast pass to see great roller coaster attractions. Parade is a must see and worth the wait.
1429,5,16-Dec,N/A,Disney Trip ... exceeded expectations ,"We've been to theme parks in Australia but Disneyland was exceptional !Lots of rides regardless of your age ( we were glad there was a good selection for our 5 year old )The street parade was wonderful Day and night - the lights parade was spectacular !!!You must stay for the end show ( castle light show ? ) it was Fabulous and enjoyed by us all !Great day , long day but well worth it !For some reason Disneyland was the only place in Japan my travel money card would not work so if you can take cash if using an o/s TMC."
1430,4,16-Dec,N/A,Wonderful trip and attraction,"Nice trip to tokyo disneyland,  fun and enjoyable.  However, very crowded and long queuing everywhere even the restaurants and toilets. Haha. A few tips here before going to disneyland 1. Study the tips and tricks online first ( dejiki.com ) 2. Make use of fastpass, is very important 3. Get all the show times table from the staff and plan your schedule (to check the attractions waiting time online visit  tdrnow.com ) 4. Get to the disneyland earlier  ( open at 9am to 10 PM)"
1431,5,16-Dec,N/A,Great spot for all ages,"I enjoyed this more than Disney Sea as my 2 younger children where more confident Teo go on the rides.  Having never been to Disneyland anywhere else we loved it.  Good food options & interesting sights.  We got there around 10am & caught the 930pm bus.  Bus from Shinjuku bus station more expensive than using our JR pass, but very relaxing & little walking.  In the castle they have a fantastic glass blowing display & we had a nice early 5pm dinner @ Queen of Hearts near tea cup Merry Go Round & then latter waffles while we watched the fireworks.  Brillant day.  Yes more expensive than Aus theme parks, but in a league of its own!"
1432,4,16-Dec,Australia,Great fun!,"We visited in early December so we hoped the crowds weren't going to be too big (tip - google Disneyland crowd calendar and plan your visit around that).We lined up outside at 8.40 and were in just after nine.  We fastpassed Monsters Inc, and then went straight to the Star Wars ride - 5 min wait - yay!  Then off to Space Mountain - 30min wait.  Then did Monsters Inc, and a few others...nothing longer than 10-30minutes.  We left around 2pm (we fastpassed another ride that had a four hour wait) getting our hand stamped upon exiting).  We had a late lunch outside and went back to the hotel for a rest.  Back at 6pm, and straight onto our fast pass ride.We then did Pirates of the Caribbean (pretty cool), Peter Pan and wrapped up with Star Wars another couple of times.A great day!"
1433,5,16-Dec,N/A,Fun rides n shows,Fun for kids. Good weather n lighting shows are awesome. Rides took less time compared to othet amusement parks. 
1434,5,16-Jun,Australia,Amazing Dayout,It felt so good to get back into childhood.visited Disneyland for first time and it was worth every single minute we spent there. We were 3 families travelling with young children and we all enjoyed very much. variety of rides to chose from to enjoy with young children and Adrenalin boost for adults too. Electrical Parade at night was just Awesome. none of us wanted to come out :( .... mesmerizing and memorable.
1435,5,16-Dec,United States,Review aimed at SoCal Disney fans,"We live in SoCal and decided to check out Disney Tokyo while on our Japan vacation. I would say it's worth it with a few warnings. Everything is pretty much in Japanese, but ordering food is easy and most of the staff can help you. Remember to use your fingers to indicate how many people in your party. The park is beautiful and very well maintained. The staff is so much better than the SoCal staff. Not to say that SoCal staff is bad but they go above and beyond here. The best ride is Winnie the Pooh, especially with kids. Classics like haunted mansion, space mountain and splash mountain are relatively the same. The castle is much nicer than ours. So a few warnings. We went during the week in early December and the crowd indicator was at 60%, most lines were OK 20 - 45 mins but there were still a few 70 minute lines. Some friends of ours went on the weekend and the lines were mostly 2 hours. So if possible go during the week and check the crowd indicator. Oh one last thing, I loved how orderly everyone was for shows and parades. They sit and make sure to not block people behind them, we should learn this back home. "
1436,5,16-Nov,Sweden,Great experience,"This was a great experience! The park is very pretty, and there's loads of attractions. The downside is that everything is in Japanese, but you can still enjoy the rides. Even though the queues are big during lunch, they move quite fast, and you get your food within 30 mins."
1437,5,16-Dec,Vietnam,A wonderful place,"Brilliant place to take the kids, very busy so use your fast passes wisely and plan the shows which are done via lottery each day :(  Plan to save some money for the meals which are a little higher than normal theme parks and meals a lot more smaller. "
1438,4,16-Nov,Indonesia,Japan trip on november,"Always check the weather, November can be windy and raining. The people there were so nice!! Good hotel service overall"
1439,5,16-Nov,United States,Tokyo Disneyland!,I'm a big Disney fan and it is on my bucket list to go to all the Disneyland locations. I really enjoyed seeing the differences between this Disneyland and the ones stateside. I definitely recommend wearing comfortable footwear as you will be walking a lot. I went at the end of November during the middle of the week and it was perfect. Most of the waits for the rides were short and the park was not as crowded as it is in the summer or on the weekend. This time of year it is colder so I recommend wearing layers. It is easy to remove layers if needed and the park does offer storage lockers if needed. The park does partner with different hotels in the near which have complimentary shuttles to and from the park which is nice. If you have younger kids or are a kid at heart this park is perfect for you!
1440,2,16-Dec,United Kingdom,Disappointed ,"I went to Disneyland Tokyo on a Monday so was hoping it wouldn't be too busy. I was wrong! It was ridiculously busy and there was very long waits for all of the rides we went on. We waited over an hour to get food too, I can't remember the place we went but it was in the 'Western' style area and served waffle burgers. There was one cashier per two lines so he proceeded to serve one person from one line and then switch to the other, a very drawn out process! I was also hoping to meet Disney characters whilst walking around the place but they were nowhere to be seen! It should be noted that we were a group of men (soccer team) so maybe if we had our children with us it might've been different but overall I was very disappointed. "
1441,5,16-Nov,Australia,The happiest place on earth,"We visited in Nov 2016 with our 2y & 4y.We all had the time of our lives and managed to get on plenty of rides thanks to staying at the TDH which allowed early access and the ability to come back later when times were quieter.Favourites were the Buzz Astro Blasters, Star Tours, Peter Pan and Pooh's Hunnypot.Lots of queues for everything from food to rides but worth the wait."
1442,4,16-Nov,United States,Basic Disney Experience,"Having only been to Disney World in Orlando, this was my first international Disney experience.  The park was essentially the same, but for some reason it didn't have that typical Disney feel.  However, we had a very positive experience.  The lines were manageable - there were only two times we waited 60 minutes, and that was for Monsters, Inc. and Pooh's Honey Pot.  The parades and performances, besides the songs, were all in Japanese so we couldn't understand them, but they were still enjoyable.  We went for our kids (ages 4 and 2.5), since It was the first real Disney experience for them.  They, of course, loved it.  We didn't get their early enough to take advantage of the fast pass for any of the rides.  We made a list of what we really wanted to do, and stuck to it.  We were at the park from 11 am - 9 pm.  We went on about 9 rides, and did an additional 3-4 attractions, plus a few parades and the Christmas performance.  We went to the Alice and Wonderland Banquet hall for lunch.  The line was very long, even though we waited until 2 pm to have lunch.  By 3 pm it was much shorter.  I'm glad we went for the kids, but not sure if I would go again.  The best part was that we stayed at the Tokyo Bay Hilton which made accessing the park super easy."
1443,4,15-Dec,Japan,Nice & packed,"I've heard that if you go in a rainy day is not that crowded so I went in a rainy day on Saturday and it was packed!! queueing for hours just to get in 1 attraction...maybe a rainy week-day the queueing time may be shorter.  1 day is enough to SEE only. If you want to play in many attraction as possible, probably you will need 2 days."
1444,5,16-Oct,N/A,Love it,Beautiful place... visited during the Halloween season everyone dress up appropriately and its really an added bonus to our already fantastic experience during our Disney visit. 
1445,5,16-Nov,N/A,Good experience,It was a fun experience at the Tokyo Disneyland. This place is so crowded so I recommend everyone to plan your rides in advance and also you should book the tickets beforehand. It shall always be a memorable experience for me and my girlfriend. 
1446,4,16-Nov,Jordan,Cheerful Journey,"Full of entertainments, games, and shows suitable mostly for kids, there are not many thrilling activities for adults, though.Queues are reasonable during November, and the weather was nice & cloudy."
1447,5,16-Nov,N/A,THE MOST MAGICAL PLACE EVER,"Spent an entire day at Disneyland and had so much fun, truly a magical experience. Would highly recommend to go at least 1 hour before the park opens and queue outside the entrance. Bring a mat and some food to sit there and wait. English maps are also available in the park.üíïHighly recommended rides:1) Monster Inc Ride & Go Seek (interactive ride) 2) Space mountain (dark rollercoaster)3) Pooh's hunny hunt (trackless dark ride) 4) Haunted Mansion (slow moving dark ride) 5) Splash mountain (will get a little wet, poncho not necessary) 6) Big thunder mountain (roller coaster) 7) Jungle cruise wild life expeditions üíïHighly recommended parades/live shows:1) Happiness is here @ 1.20pm - (7/10)2) Dreamlights @ 7.30pm - (10/10)- Get a spot 1 hour in advance in front of the partners statue for a good view. 3) Fireworks @ 8.30pm - (8/10)- After Dreamlights parade, quickly rush to the Cinderella castle and get a good spot for the Fireworks show and Once upon a time. 4) Once upon a time @ 8.50pm - (11/10)- 1000% Not to be missed. "
1448,5,16-Nov,Portugal,Its Disney and Japan. Enough Said!,"Even so its not the biggest and best disneyland I¬¥ve been to . Its had a very nice feeling to it. Things are very weal organized, guest are very polite, cast members are always helpful and with a prompt smile. Maybe the rides are inferior when compared to other disneylands, the magic the crowd gives is a very big plus, you will see lots of cool people with almost full character costumes making it a unique atmosphere .Try to get into many rides as possible , making a smart use of the fastpass, take them early in the morning and take a new one each two hours. At the end of the day enjoy the wonderful shows. (night parade, fireworks and video mapping).I was lucky to visit during the holiday season and enjoy the haunted mansion holiday makeover. If in season this is a must see."
1449,4,16-Nov,Philippines,HAPPIEST PLACE BUT....NEVER ON A WEEKEND!!!,It was our son's 10th birthday and we were forced to go on a weekend. And man oh man the line a Monsters Inc was almost 3 hours with a sign that says 120 mins waiting. Fast pass was gone within 1 hour from the opening of gates. Have to wait in line for at least 30 mins to an hour to get food even churros from the stalls. THE PARK WAS PACKED!
1450,5,16-Oct,N/A,"you must dress like a character and be the same as your partner,friend etc...ita an amazing experience","its very coolant tourists!!! only asians, and yes be aware the lines are veryyyyy long, so take your fast pass for the primary attractions!!!!"
1451,5,16-Apr,China,"Really, who don't like Disneyland?","Been to other Disneyland before but Tokyo Disneyland must be rated as one of my favorite Disneyland.  From the products they sell, the show they put on, the atmosphere and the rides.  It really brings magic."
1452,4,16-Nov,France,Good fun but could organise events for corporation,This is always a very good place to organise team building exercise as people return to be like kids !We did a tour in the park at 6.30 pm and I was expecting a super busy park but it was more than ok. I think they should organise activities for business 
1453,5,16-Nov,Australia,First time,"It's our first time in Disneyland and we were tossing wether to go to Disney sea or Disneyland. We ended up in Disneyland and we were not disappointed from the moment you walk in, childhood memories floods back to our memories and it's as if we were childlike again even though we had our toddler son with us. It was fun, great fun! The rides were catered for both adults and young children and we found the only Baby shop in Disneyland where they had the most cutest outfits for babies and toddlers. We waited and watched till the night light parade as well as the fireworks at cinderellas castle. It was a one day event for us and it was worth it."
1454,4,16-Nov,United Kingdom,Ok apart from the locals ,"I don't like this Disney park as much as the American ones Main reason the locals shoving and pushing to get to front for parades and queues , as for the hysterical screaming when they see Mickey Mouse makes you want to get away as fast as you can "
1455,5,15-Dec,China,Wnderful Land,"I came to Tokyo with my four best friend in last May. I felt nervous and looking forward to this trip because I went to Japan first time. We did many research and we found we should go to Tokyo Disney Resort which is a wonderful place. In Tokyo Disney Resort, there are two different style which are Disneyland (for children), and Disney Sea. However, we decided to go to Tokyo Disneyland. It is because Disneyland is more cartoon characters, and we can take photos with them. When I arrived, I saw very beautiful landscape and buildings. The first thing we should do of course is took lots of photos and selfies. When we went in, we saw lots of cartoon characters such as Mickey, Winnie-the-pooh, Donald Duck, and Stitch etc. They are very lovely. At the beginning, I am afraid I will feel boring because Disneyland is for children. And now, I have never regretted we chose Disneyland. After we finished taking photos, we played most of games. Moreover, I recommend five attraction games below:1. Big Thunder Mountain: is a roller coaster.2. It's A Small World: you can see traditional costumes of different countries.3. Dumbo The Flying Elephant: you can control it going up or going down just as flying in the sky.4. Space Mountain: is a roller coaster.5. Grand Circuit Raceway: I am a racer when you are playing.However, I like Space Mountain the most, and it is very thrilling and deserved to try. Because of calling Space Mountain, you play it in dark houses a space station. It will make you feel exciting and amazing during playing this roller coaster.Tokyo Disneyland is a wonderful place and deserved you to go in order to enjoy this amazing time."
1456,4,16-Nov,Australia,Just like Disney World in Orlando,We went to Tokyo Disney on a sunny Tuesday with prepurchased tickets. We didn't arrive until about 10am and was quite surprise how sparse the park was. We quickly went around getting a fast pass for space mountain then went on Star Tours and then monsters inc. monsters inc only have about a 50min wait time however later on in the day it got up to 1.5hours (which is actually not too bad for Tokyo Disney). The fast passes for Monters Inc went very fast. The other rides also had moderate wait times during the day of about 1 hour and fast passes were lasting until about 5pm. For some reason the 2 most popular rides are Monters Inc and Poohs Honey Pot Hunt. Wait times for those were getting up to 1.5 hours consistently through the day.Tokyo Disney has a very similar feel and rides to Disney World in Orlando. If you are looking for something different to Orlando then don't come to Tokyo Disney. The parades were great and had a range of characters. Everyone sits down nicely to watch the parade and camera kept at eye level so you don't block anyone's view. The nighttime fireworks were pretty average. Nothing like Orlando. However the Cinderella castle light up show was excellent. The story is in Japanese but doesn't matter. You get the gist of it.Overall we had a great Disney day and was much relieved that it wasn't as busy as Disney Sea. 
1457,3,16-Oct,Indonesia,Disneyland is Japanese Teenagers Central ;),Disneyland Tokyo is really crowded. I think Japanese teenagers central besides Universal Studios. Every Attractions is never without long queue. But in Tokyo Disneyland we can find many Japanese people wearing cosplay as disney figures. This is maybe we never get in other Disnyeland in other countries. Many teenagers are so total coming to this place with their styles and cosplays.Suggest:Don't forget to use the fast pass of the ticket. The disneyland ticket is consisted of 3 fast past attractions that we don't need to queuing.Don't go at weekend  or national holidays
1458,5,16-Nov,Indonesia,it where adult become kids again ,"For someone who has been to Disneyland in paris, the experience at Disneyland in Tokyo would feel fairly similar. However, for a Disneyland fan who has visited the paris theme parks enough that they more or less anticipate every moment of their favorite rides, Tokyo Disneyland offers something both welcomingly familiar and refreshingly different. Also, Tokyo Disney Resort is also home to Tokyo DisneySea, a unique Disney theme park that many people consider to be the best theme park in the world.what make Tokyo Disneyland different from paris is the Fans .. they willing to spend money to purchase they favorite character item and wear it happily ..!!    oh i love the disney cookies .."
1459,4,15-Dec,N/A,Great! But maybe not so,Tokyo  Disneyland is awesome but the lines are too long and the fastpass rides are only a few. I guess overall is great.
1460,5,16-Aug,Taiwan,The best Disney I think,"I took a trip to Japan for 12 days in this summer vacation.Though it was during the semester of Japaneses, there were lots of students from all ages there.I was been in the sea side of Tokyo Disneyland, the shows and parades made me being touching.The price of foods and souvenirs are not in low price, but you are in Disney.Why not have some, doesn't it?"
1461,5,16-Jul,N/A,Childlike !!! <3,"It‚Äôs just like I‚Äôm in a fairy tale! Although I‚Äôm not a child anymore, but I still love the themes and the mascots there. Disneyland is especially for children. But it can let adult like it, too! There are many interesting rides and souvenir shops for everyone, but maybe you should wait a long time because there are so many people that you can‚Äôt play all rides in a day. You can spend more than one day in Disneyland to enjoy and reflect on your childhood. It was too memorable to forget the day in Disneyland. The rides are the most impressive experience for me. Because it‚Äôs so stimulate that I just felt like my heart beat a beat! Although we waited for a long time, but it was a worth tasting. All of you guys should visit Disneyland once or more!"
1462,5,16-Sep,United Kingdom,best disney ever,"it was amazing really enjoyed my day and the rides, the parades were good also. We went on the busiest day ever but still enjoyed it."
1463,5,16-Oct,Australia,Well organised,We were in Tokyo and where did our fun loving 26 year old daughter want to visit Disneyland. 3 street shows and although it was busy (I'm sure it gets more so looking at the wait signs) we really didn't have to wait. By going with her we went on rides we probably wouldn't have done if we'd gone alone. It was her dads first ever theme park and he was quit surprisedAs it wasn't overly crowded it was an enjoyable day 
1464,5,16-Nov,Malaysia,Energetic and fun,"I am so amazed by the energy and excitement that the Japanese exudes here in Tokyo Disneyland - it is infectious.  Definitely different from my experience in Disneyland LA and Paris.  Just come during weekdays and avoid weekends, public holidays and school holidays."
1465,5,16-Nov,United Kingdom,Amazing as always!!,"Typical Disney is like anywhere else in the world, but only difference being the language. Lots of Japanese language instructions and staff, but most of them are able to guide you in English, unlike anywhere else in Japan. In the beginning itself, try to go the famous attractions list by reading the ones which have ‚Äúfast-pass‚Äù. These are the ones which are most famous, and if you have limited time then try to keep your focus on these attractions and the famous disney parade. Avoid weekends if possible, because anyways Tokyo is overcrowded and in the weekend the wait time increases for all the rides/attractions."
1466,4,16-Nov,Australia,Definitely a Highlight,"Disney Japan was a highlight having also visited Universal Studios in Osaka. Being a first timer, I did not have much of an expectation but found it fun and felt like being a kid again....truly happiest place... you have to visit the land and sea world separately or you can't see and visit all the attractions.  Whilst the land version is more catered to children (sea is more adults), we were impressed by the uplifting parade and energy so you cannot miss that.  Really liked the fact you can buy fast pass for individual attractions which made life easier at times.  We tried the much hyped turkey leg which was good but very very very filling (was trying to figure out where all the turkeys came from given how popular it was). We then tried the chicken leg which was more manageable and pretty good as well. Liked the atmosphere and Disney was okay with you bringing food which was nice. This made it easier as the restaurants were packed.  It was also better as we were sneaking food in at another theme park.....:-/"
1467,5,16-Oct,Indonesia,Amazing place for kids and their parents,"Went with my 2 kids in early October 2016. It was not that cold in the evening in the day can be quite warm. We arrived in the late morning by bus from Oshiage. Kids were 8 and 3 years old, so we didnt expect to spend too much time on riding all the venue. Our main purpose was to see the carnival in the afternoon and in the evening. The whole carnival set up was amazing, kids loving it.. We rent the stroller to minimise the walking, place was very clean, can be crowded at certain peak hour. This place is a must go when visiting Japan. Ticket was quite expensive."
1468,5,16-Oct,Singapore,Must visit place in tokyo,My third visit to Tokyo Disneyland Still as specular and ever. Avoid weekend and the night parade and day parade is really fun.
1469,5,16-Oct,N/A,Absolutely amazing,Cannot rave enough about this place. Its magical. The lines are long on some attractions but everything is run so efficiently that it doesnt matter. Love this place so much.
1470,4,16-Oct,Australia,Great fun - even for adults!,Had a great day- got in early and beat the rush - went during the week - so crowds were solid but wait times fro rides was minimal - and weather was a bit cloudy but was a lot if fun. Based on California - it is almost the same except for the noodles and curries on sale for food! It is a lot of fun and the crowds are all happy and enjoying the experience.Easy to get to via subway  - go early it will make the day easier  - but you will get caught in peak hour on the subway - so be prepared to get squeezed in.
1471,5,16-Nov,N/A,Wowed,First park we went to during the halloween season. It was amazing. Loads of shops and food places to choose from. The parades were so good. 
1472,5,16-Nov,N/A,So much fun!,"Had an amazing time here, turned up on a drizzling Tuesday, expected it would be reasonably quiet, but it was still pretty busy!Regardless of the bad weather, we had a fantastic time, wandering around the parks and going on various rides. The fast pass system is fantastic, just make sure you plan your day out. We didn't get to go on splash mountain as we didn't feel like waiting over an hour and by the time we had a free fast pass, it was over for the day, but that is no fault of the park - just goes to show how good it is that people are willing to wait that time!Overall, wait times were pretty good, especially with the volumes of people. Staff were EXTREMELY friendly and helpful!"
1473,5,16-Oct,United Kingdom,One of the best!,"I have been to Disney World Florida over 8 times and Paris 3. So off course I thought I would give this park a go, i was not disappointed.The park is on par with the other parks I have been to, but what this park does better is:1. Food, there is a lot more selection for food stalls and restaurants.2. Seating areas, general seating areas are alot more common and great for taking a break.3. The people both staff and the Japanese people are so much more happier and overall a joyful crowd to be with!"
1474,1,16-Sep,Austria,worst place ever,"there is not one main attraction you dont wait for 3 hours, in a full day you can ride 2-3 times and spend all day Long waiting in lines. it is full of People, they dont Limit the number of People, this is the worst Disney ever.   even the attractions didnt work well, space mointain without lighteffects and so on. never agian this is a totaly waste of Money and time !!!"
1475,5,16-Oct,Singapore,Great Disney experience,"We have been in Hong Kong Disneyland for three times before this visit to Tokyo Disneyland. I have to say the latter offered a better Disneyland experience.With less time spent, we managed to do more rides and activities with our 5 years old daughter here. It was still crowded but you feel it was more organized and less chaotic here. The meeting with Disney characters was more interactive and more fun (compared just queueing for photos). Recommend to book the tickets online and print the e-ticket, so you don't have to queue at the ticket office. The online tickets are open for sale two months before the actual visit date (E.g, we did the visit on Oct 20th, and the ticket for that date was open for sale on Aug 20th)"
1476,5,16-Aug,Singapore,Disney lovers! ,Must go for Disney lovers. Packed w tourist as always for all Disneyland. Book your express pass before your next ride to save time! And don't forget to grab one of the Disney character pop corn holder as souvenir back home! 
1477,5,16-Oct,Canada,Always a good place...crowded...but good,We went close to Halloween and had no idea that the people in Japan are starting to get into character.  There were SOOOO many people dressed in costumes - Disney characters - that we were definitely outnumbered.  Half the fun on this visit (our 2nd time to Tokyo Disneyland) was seeing people dressed up.  All ages too...from very young to old.
1478,5,16-Oct,Australia,Great park and must for all Disney fans!,"I love this park!I‚Äôve visited Tokyo Disneyland (TDL) many many times and it never fails to offer a fantastic day!Although smaller than Disney World it still offers all of the great rides and experiences one comes to expect from Disneyland.  Since it hasn‚Äôt been entirely updated, like DW has it still retains that classic Disneyland feel.  A must see is the Pooh ride which is very different from the one at DW and much more enjoyable.  In addition, their Toontown is excellent and lots of fun.We were fortunate and the crowds were manageable.  The longest we had to wait was maybe 70 minutes for Splash Mountain but other than that all of the other lines moved very well, this was nice in comparison to Disney Sea where the waiting time ratio to ride enjoyment did not match, at TDL you definitely get value for your wait.  If you‚Äôre a Disney fan and you‚Äôre in Tokyo I highly recommend this great park!"
1479,5,16-Mar,Mexico,A very delighful day with my girlfriend,"I surprised my girlfriend by going to Disney Land when we were in Tokyo for the last week of the month we spent in Japan. It was her birthday so she got a birthday pass. The ticketing system is terrific, no waiting lines to get into the park. The attractions were crowded but with the reserving of seats we could get around and see everything. The Star Wars ride was awesome, the engineering in the rides is great, you do not get wet at all in the water attractions. The parades are great. Definitely a must go."
1480,5,16-Oct,Philippines,Amazing Experience!,"Not just for kids, adults get to enjoy too. There are a lot of activities to choose from, one day is definitely not enough to enjoy all of it! The parades are great, characters are available to greet guests, and fun to take pictures. I love the waffle restaurant which serves Mickey Mouse-shape waffles!"
1481,5,16-Apr,Australia,Best Disneyland on planet earth!!!,"By far, and beyond your wildest dreams, this is the best Disneyland! The park itself is more like a magical place then a man made structure, with an abundance of beautiful plant life and actual buildings! The characters are authentic and every detail perfect. The food outlets are top class. It's safe, spotlessly clean and somewhere you won't want to leave!"
1482,5,16-Jan,Canada,A really magical place in Tokyo,"The favorite Tokyo Disneyland. The first Disneyland in Asia, and my favorite one. I went there after the new year, so it was still crowded with people on holiday. This Disneyland is also really assessable by public transportation which is a big plus. Tokyo Disneyland is really similar to Magic Kingdom in Orlando. I love the new star war attractation and this version of Monster INC, which is super interactive and popular. So get a fastpass at the beginning of the day. And then go to the Star War attraction, avoid the line. The firework was awsome and my favoutie part is the delious food and all the shops in Tokyo Disaneyland. I trully have a great time there. But since most of  performance is in Japanese which means less enjoyable for non Japanese speaker"
1483,5,16-Jan,United Arab Emirates,It was very cold in December but very enjoyable trip.,"The park was so nice and the weather.  However, they are fully packed.  We have to run and get FAST TRACK tickets. but the major rides we were not able to get as it finished so fast. If you have one fast track, you can only get another one only after 2-3 hours, by that time it allows you to get one, the ticket for other rides will be finished. :( one day is not enough.. with a long lines.  But it was fun especially the last part where there are fire works and story telling."
1484,4,16-Oct,Thailand,The land of dream,The fifth Disneyland that I visited.  A different impression from the very first one watching my daughter enjoy the theme parks
1485,4,16-Oct,United States,No Children Here,"My wife and I have no children but decided to visit here because she is a Disney supporter.  We did walk the entire park in less than two hours. Most of the attractions were in Japanese (duh, right) but we still had an great time. The wait time were not that long since we went on a Wednesday. Our tour company gave us the option of coming back at 6 pm or 9pm. I didn't respond in a timely fashion via email so they chose 9pm. No biggie. We got there at around 1145am. We started walking around and looking at the attractions. Then decided that we should call the tour company and arrange a 6pm pick up time. They were more than accommodating. The Japanese culture was very unique, nice and offered help wherever we needed it."
1486,4,16-Sep,Philippines,Great place but very humid during September,"The Disneyland park is big and very beautiful, but the crowds are huge even during weekdays so be prepared to wait in long lines to get to a ride. Make sure to avail of the fastpass as much as you can. Plan your rides accordingly.There was nothing special about the evening fireworks display, but the song that they played was nice.Tips:- make sure to drink plenty of water - bring your own water bottle and refill them in one of the many drinking fountains located within the park- brink extra shirts and face towels"
1487,4,16-May,N/A,Feeling like a kid again!,"My husband and I visited Tokyo Disney land for the first time. It was very nostalgic, be prepared for a lot of walking and lining up. If you can get a fast pass for rides, the ticket machines are quite close to each other. I loved the detailing of the buildings, the parade that was held also on the day, everything was very neat and tidy and people were nice there. Definatley recommend to visit, just gives you that wonderful kid feeling again."
1488,4,16-Oct,N/A,You must enjoy crowds,"As I am not really a Disney fan my comments a more from a Dads point of view. Its busy, busy busy be prepared to line up for everything. Some great rides albeit Disney Sea has better rides in the kids opinion"
1489,4,16-Oct,Singapore,Great for younger kids,Went with a 3-year-old and 5-year-old on a weekday. Managed to catch both the afternoon and evening parades as well as the lightshow and fireworks in front of Cinderella's Castle. Thoroughly enjoyable. Dining options are fairly limited (mainly fastfood) and the only Japanese restaurant had an hour-long wait when we tried to get a table for lunch and dinner.
1490,1,16-Oct,Norway,Ridiculously long queues,"Nice attractions but waiting 90-130! minutes at each place ruins the visit. Even buying a snack requires 30-40 min. in line. Kids really disappointed. If you have go, avoid weekends, get there really early, run for the fast passes, bring food."
1491,5,16-Oct,United Kingdom,"""The Kingdom of Dreams & Wishes""","Disneyland....The place where no one needs to grow up.This is the third Disney I have visited around the world and yet, none of them have disappointed.Before we left for Tokyo I booked the resort tickets in the UK. This was a fairly simple process that involved creating a Disney account, selecting tickets and paying by credit card. The system won't allow you to pay for tickets using an overseas debit card. Once the tickets were brought I was able to print them at home knowing that I was guaranteed entry. The tickets are only released 60 days before the day you want to visit and once they are gone you will not be allowed to enter. They run a strict policy on overcrowding, although, if you stay in a Disney partner hotel you are guaranteed entry with ""in house"" ticket counters.We stayed in the Sheraton Tokyo Bay Hotel on the resort, within easy reach of the Bayside Disneyland Station and this was a fantastic base for our trip. The hotel has fantastic service. The staff were friendly and polite and could converse in English if required. We were able to book bus tickets* back to the airport and could have brought our Disney tickets in house. * Pro Tip! - Take the bus from Narita Airport to Disney. We landed at 23:00 and had no option but to take a taxi roughly 40km. This was expensive 26,000 yen or approx ¬£200! The bus was 5,000 yen for two people*Once you have traveled around the Disney Resort Line you make it to Disneyland. We arrived at 07:30 and the park opened at 08:00. The queue was already massive. The Japanese are huge on Disney and this makes the experience once of the most unique! Once in the park you are taken to familiar surroundings on Main Street USA. Tokyo Disney has a few rides that are special to its location such as ""Pooh's Hunny Hunt' and ""Toy Story Mania"" these are hugely popular attractions and I recommend getting fast passes if you wish to enjoy them. The fast pass system works differently there than in the UK, there is no extra cost, you simply scan your ticket at the rides fast pass machine and it prints. The catch? They run out incredibly quickly. The food was good and there is plenty of variety available. A huge hit in Tokyo is popcorn. Popcorn is served all around the park and is presented in beautiful plastic character containers which serve as great souvenirs, this is something I have never seen before at a Disney Resort and again shows how over the top things are in Japan! (In a good way I must add!) The resort can get overcrowded at the weekends, there is a simple webpage to use that allows you to see the predicted visitor numbers for the day you are thinking about. We went on a Tuesday and found it not to be too bad. The park gets busier after 18:00 as there are special ticklers that only allow entry after this time and the park begins to fill with school children of all ages. A visit here is quite expensive. Tickets are 7400 yen, food ranges from 500 yen to 2000 yen and the shops are typical disney, expensive and you want everything! So be sure to have saved prior!In conclusion - If your a Disney fan then this is a must see in Tokyo. If your not a Disney fan then this is a must see in Tokyo! Disney is fantastic, its loud, fabulous and magical. It allows adults to feel young again and children to let there imagination take them anywhere. Would I do it again? In a heartbeat.....See my Hong Kong Disney review here - https://en.tripadvisor.com.hk/Attraction_Review-g294217-d543602-Reviews-Hong_Kong_Disneyland-Hong_Kong.html"
1492,5,16-Oct,United States,Great,Stayed at the Sheraton Tokyo Bay with easy access to the tram. Tokyo Disney is similarly designed but also different to the Disneylands in the USA.The park seems smaller but more spacious without being crowded. Some of the rides were the same but with a different flair. Restaurants are different and the food was good. Customer service was wonderful as is anywhere in Japan. Definitely worth the visit if you have kids or like Disneyland.
1493,5,16-Oct,Australia,Lots of fun and enjoyment,"I have never been in Disneyland before, soI cannot compare. But Tokyo Disneyland are beautiful and we enjoyed it a lot. It's easy to get there by train. I went on Wednesday and I didn't have to wait long for the rides. The all place is so clean and organised. The staffs doesn't speak English much but they try to help and they are very nice. We watched the Light parade at 7:30 pm. Beautiful! It's a must to do. "
1494,5,16-Oct,United States,Great Fun - A Must See in Tokyo,"My daughter an I went to Disneyland in Tokyo in October 2016. It was a treat for both of us! We got there early and spent the entire day until the Fireworks at night. The park is similar to Disneyworld in Orlando, Florida, but with a Japanese influence. One of our favorite things was seeing the different restaurants and the food serviced at each. They have several different popcorn flavors, my favorite is Soy Sauce and Butter. They also have Mochi treats in the shape of different characters. We dined at the Crystal Palace, the same concept as in Disney World, with awesome Japanese food. I would recommend to anyone visiting Tokyo with enough time to plan a trip to Disneyland. Great Fun for every age!"
1495,5,16-Jan,India,Mesmerizing experience,Feels like truly Magical !! Totally love disneyland. Rides and shows are amazing to watch. Meeting characters is fun to be with....
1496,1,16-Oct,Singapore,Ticketing services bad,"On 17 Oct 2016, my last day of holiday in Japan. My trip was to visit tokyo disneyland. However, I forgot to printout the tickets for entrance and have them in my mobile. I even logged to my email address to show proof. But there is no printer at disneyland to enable me to print out. Also i travelled all the way from Singapore and yet they ask my travel agent to bring. How is ny travel agent from singapore able to fly here. Furthermore with the high techology nowadays, should disneyland allow mobile bar scanned? What if people after purchases do not have printer? Japan is 1 of the top countries promoting recycle and eco-friendly which I am still impressed with japanese able to separate their waste accordingly. With nowadays promoting eco-environment, shouldnt tokyo disneyland encouraging less paper waste instead?Japan has always be my favourite place to travel. Such a good place with good services and food and many more. However, the ticket issues made my trip sank. My last day of my birthday trip in japan totally spoilt and we have to re-purchased the ticket. Is ny mistake forgotten to print but shouldnt they allow to printout or mobile scanned bar code?"
1497,5,16-Oct,United Kingdom,Disneyland is always worth it,"Halloween themed disneyland? How could we resist even on a Sunday.Firstly the staff were tremendous, helpful to everyone around and all spoke english to, excellent at directing people when an event was on to. Talking on events, the parades are great and everyone really gets into it the fireworks display at 8.30 was a must see to.I would recommend getting the free fast passes asap, often you can queue for one ride then fast pass another.After 9pm almost all the queues disappear if you missed any of the tides."
1498,4,16-Oct,Australia,Kids love it,"Better than the Disneyland we've visited ini LA but big crowds meant long wait times (always seems to be the case). Our grandson loved it though - the rides, the parades and the friendly & helpful staff. In typical japanese fashion, the venue is spectacularly clean and maintained. Well worth the cost."
1499,5,16-May,United States,A must do if you are a Disney fan,"If you have only been to the Disney parks in the United States, you will find some similarities. However, the food in Tokyo Disneyland will have your mind blown! They put so much details into everything. Tokyo Disneyland has Cinderella's castle and it is surrounded by breath taken flowers.Be sure to do your research on unique restaurants ex. the queen of hearts restaurant. We went during the Easter season. They had characters that were shaped like eggs throughout the park. It was so much fun trying to find them! Also, make sure you try the popcorn! They have lots of different flavors. The only other thing that might be strange or different is how you meet characters. Some characters do have lines that you wait your turn. But some characters you just follow around and wait until they point to you and then you can take their picture. It's interesting to as the least and different from the states. But sure to check out Disneyseas as well if you have he time!"
1500,5,16-Oct,United States,Disney family and we loved it...,"We have Disneyland (California) passes and have been to Disneyworld and Disneyland Paris, so of course we had to check out Disneyland Tokyo.  We were not disappointed!  The park is an easy train ride from Tokyo and along Tokyo Bay.  We only went to Disneyland, not the aquarium, and we were pleasantly surprised that the pricing is much cheaper than the US and that they offered ""junior"" passes for older kids (I have two teens).  It is a very large facility and was spread out.  We were surprised to find that many of the rides were very similar to the US rides, unlike Disneyland Paris.  The staff was very happy and provide the Disney-quality service you expect and the park was exceptionally clean.  The wait times were pretty long, though we utilized the fast pass system so it wasn't bad (not nearly as bad as the US parks).  Surprisingly, some rides that appear to be very popular here (ie: Monster's Inc.) are not as popular in the US.  It was interesting to see the different snacks around the park that we don't have in the US, such as different flavored popcorn like chocolate and soy sauce.  I have two minor complaints.  One, we did not make advanced reservations for dining and went to at least 5 restaurants which were full and required a reservation (Blue Bayou is at this park).  The other restaurants had food that was a little outside of what we wanted, such as all curry.  We finally found a pizza restaurant that had a very long wait and only included three kinds of  pizza (I had to custom-request just cheese for my vegetarian daughter which they did accommodate but did not seem used to the request).  The pizza was great and inexpensive.  My other complaint is we really wanted a ""Disneyland Tokyo"" t-shirt or other specific souvenirs as we collect them.  We checked many stores and only one t-shirt specifically said Tokyo and it was Halloween-themed so we did not get it.  I only found a pin and an ornament so we were disappointed in the selection of Tokyo-specific souvenirs.  All in all, however, we had a fantastic day and this is now one of my favorite Disney parks."
1501,5,16-Oct,N/A,Amusement park,Easy to access by train.The fast pass is free and it is worth to get to some atractions.Price ¬•7400 (us$74)
1502,5,16-Oct,Singapore,The magic of Disney is still going!,"We had a day off and went to Disney, on a Saturday. It was crowded as in other Disney parks we've been to (Family with kids ages 6 and 9). My tip for you is to get there 15-20 mins before they open, and once you get in, go to the Big Thunder Mountain train to get the Fast Pass, and then queue in Splash Mountain. They would not let you get more than one Fast Pass at a time, so try to use the next one available. While my kids were at Its a Small World with my wife, I ran to get the Fast Pass at Space Mountain, so something like that may work for you."
1503,4,16-Sep,N/A,Had fun in Tokyo Disneyland!,"I had so much fun in Tokyo Disneyland. But bare in mind, longgggg que for each game. Have to plan properly so that you not waste time on que. Add more Halal Food to cater for Muslim visitor."
1504,4,16-Oct,N/A,Ok for smaller children,I definitely recommend this place if you have smaller children.Considering we came here on a weekday but the first day we came to Tokyo it was their 3 day bank holiday so it was busier than expected.Parking in Japan for this park was very long but because there is always people directing you to a free spot it was really handy rather than going around and spending half the day looking for a parking place. Japanese people park their cars in rows so if you are luckily you might get shown to a closer spot but it's Disneyland so don't expect to see an open space so fast!Average waiting time I would say about 45-60mins and I DEFINITELY recommend everyone who come here to get a FAST TRACK TICKET! The only problem was when we went all the fast track tickets were sold out. It turns out that you have to go really early... something like 9-10 when the place opens and buy the fast track tickets and go wonder off out of the theme park and come back later! It was a pleasurable experience as it is Disneyland but I do recommend wear some decent shoes as Disneysea is nearby and it's much more newer and more romantic with better rides.If you are around or near the parades I also recommend you ask someone what time is the parades and queue to watch the parade as you will be moved on all around the park and will not be able to stand and watch anywhere you like. They like to keep the flow of people moving and keeping everything in order which they are obsessed with!
1505,4,16-Jan,Iran,EVERYTHINGS ARE VERY GOOD & HAVE A NICE TIME,i highly recommend to visitors to come tokoyo disneyland and have a nice time.visit of here was a new experience because you can see LA disneyland with japanese idea and language.park is very clean.you can find many restaurant and fast food.i went there for 2 days but i couldn`t see all of part of disnenland.
1506,5,16-Sep,Malaysia,Awesome Night Parade,The Tokyo Disneyland is one of the best Disneylands ever. I would choose Tokyo Disney over Shanghai's any time.The parade was fantastic but the night parade was awesome!!! It is something that you shouldn't miss.
1507,5,16-Sep,N/A,Very Fun,"We had a great day at Tokyo Disney. The staff was friendly, lines were not to long and the rides were very fun. Even though it was a little rainy outside they atmosphere and the fun loving service made it all worth it."
1508,3,16-Oct,N/A,3 hour visit late evening was ideal,"Thursday evening in October was ideal for us. We did all we wanted in Fantasyland and Pirates for girls 10-13 not wanting bigger roller coasters. Cons: Though low crowds, 5 minute waits, they still ran the rides Peter Pan, Snow White, and Pinocchio at fast speed. Like way to fast to appreciate. Almost a joke. For the little ones, Snow White is more of a haunted house, ie more like the witch's ride. She'll greet you a dozen times. In retrospect, I don't think Snow White is even there. Including no fairytale ending as they used to have in Orlando. That would have used up too much time. PhilharMagic not quite so magic with singing in Japanese."
1509,4,16-Oct,United Kingdom,Mickey and friends in Tokyo!,"I had never previously visited a single Disney park prior to visiting Disneyland Tokyo, which is strange as I'm from Wales! Never the less I didn't know what to expect and besides going with a group of young friends (4, 25 year olds) we had an absolute blast. There was enough to do here to keep you busy for the majority of the day. The one thing I have to mention in the great fast track system they have implemented. I have no idea if this is the same across all parks worldwide but all fast track tickets are completely free! You paid your 7,800¬• entrance fee and to get a fast track ticket you simply had to use your 1-day passport (ticket) and put it in the machines outside the rides that count. You'd then get a fast track ticket with a time to come back too. We visited during the week in October and we managed to get every fast track easy, and did all the big rides within a few hours. We didn't queue for more than 5 minutes for anything. I'd highly recommended going during the week outside of peak times, it was great! The park had a Halloween theme going on and this was even more evidence in the park parades, which were fun. Also, everything is completely in Japanese on these rides, which makes the Star Wars simulator a lot more fun in my eyes but it may not be everybody's cup of tea. Obviously there's no thrill rides here, although space mountain was an absolute gem! One embarrassing moment though, the carts aren't made for Gaijins. I (6'5 western man) couldn't fit in the front seats. My legs just couldn't fit in, so beware! Overall, a great day out, obviously it's completely geared towards children and families but still a great fun option between friends."
1510,2,16-Sep,Australia,"Dont visit if you have previous experience from US, Hongkong or Europe Disneyland","The park itself is ok. Just average if you compare to other Disneyland parks. They have very ridiculous rules like that you cant stand up when taking pictures during the parades. Of course each attraction park needs some rule but here they will not let you be free person and breathe and enjoy your time in the park. You must follow as a sheep, they will immediately punish you if you even put your arm up or stand little bit different way in the line for attraction etc. Totally ruin your experience. There are not much characters that your child can meet. When you spend over an hour in line to take pictures with Mickey Mouse and refuse to buy a picture from them they will only let you take 1picture with Mickey by your own camera! If you ask for one more they refuse and take the character away so you cant take any more pics....etc.etc. For me it was waste of money."
1511,4,16-Sep,United States,Classic Disney with a Japanese twist,"Tokyo Disney is surprisingly nostalgic...Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, Three Amigos, Jungle Cruise, etc. It feels like so much of it is the way Disney originally designed the attractions. At Disneyland California, the Swiss Family Robinson treehouse is now Tarzan's treehouse to appeal to a younger audience but it's neat to see Disneyland with a more original feel. However, it also has definite Japanese flare, particularly in how so many people dress up in costumes and cutesy Minnie mouse ears. The park is very clean and the staff friendly, most also speak some English."
1512,5,16-Sep,United States,More Magic in Japan,"Similar to Disney Sea - be sure to start your day early.  Especially if you only have a day to visit.  Many of the rides are very similar to Disneyland in Anaheim but do try the Monsters Inc and Pooh's Honey Hunt ride.  Get FP's if you can because these rides are popular.  Jungle Cruise was nice-bit newer as well as Space Tours, Pirates and Big Thunder.  If you are a fan of Electrical Parade - they have one here.  But do see the show at the Castle - Once Upon a Time.  This is a great show and nice way to end the night.  Fireworks similar to Disney Sea - but not as spectacular as Anaheim's 60th Anniversary show.  All in all had a very magical day."
1513,4,16-Sep,Australia,Great time in Disneyland,"We had a fabulous time in Disneyland, having prepurchased our tickets we would skip the queue and head straight in.  There is plenty to see and do and remember to use the FastPass system as this works really well and saves hours in a line!  If you want Toymania FastPass though be early as the queue for that was absolutely enormous, I think it would have been quicker to line up for the ride than the FastPass!Is a bit weird hearing all the characters speaking Japanese but we were in Japan.  The electric light parade was beautiful and the fireworks great although we were lucky as they did not take place the night before or the night after our day in Disneyland due to possible rain."
1514,5,16-Oct,N/A,Better Than The States,"Tokyo Disneyland was so much fun! I enjoyed coming here more than both Disney parks in the U.S. This park was very clean, even after it rained for a bit, they took squeegees to benches and the ground so we could have dry places to sit and walk. I love that all the ride attendants were extremely efficient getting people on and off the rides to ensure shorter ride wait times. I love that during the parades there were more people sitting rather than standing along the parade routes. The only negative for us was that the Indiana Jones ride is located in Tokyo DisneySea. Overall, the park and food were very enjoyable!"
1515,4,16-Sep,Australia,Lot of fun,Took family to the park spent two days and still did not see everything. Long lines at most rides. Need  to get there early to take advantage of fast passes system.  Found that there were not enough drink outlets  in  park so food and drink lines long at limited access points. Plus shops all seemed to carry same merchandise limited choices and limited large sizing of clothing.
1516,5,15-Nov,Australia,Amazing experience,We wanted a different experience to what we have already when we were last in the USA and visited the original Disney Land in L.A.What we experienced was a wonderful few days that bin my opinion beats hands down the Disneyland in L.A. and is more like the Disneyworld experience in Florida USA. The first thing you need to appreciate is that it is two theme parks in one. Disneyland and Disney Sea. You need more than one day at each part of the resort. We spent 4 days here all up and could easily have spent an extra day here. We came here with two children aged 7 and 9 and they wanted to see everything and go on every ride which is absolutely not possible in just a few days.I would definitely recommend this place to all visitors and not just the local Japanese tourists.
1517,4,16-Oct,Malaysia,All that you‚Äôd expect of Disney,"Not sure if it‚Äôs a Disney thing or a cultural thing but everything at Disneyland Tokyo is well organised and efficient. From queuing for rides, ordering in restaurants and preparing for the parades.  We visited with two under fives and they loved the experience. However, note that some fairly innocuous rides inexplicably have some scary moments. Even the wild west train ride suddenly plunges into darkness and passes by fighting dinosaurs which shocked and scared our kids. Don‚Äôt miss the noon time parade. Food is reasonably priced given the location.  Access is easy from the city via train.  Water fountains abundant throughout the park so just bring a refillable bottle. We visited on a weekday and it was still busy so I‚Äôm imagine weekends are hectic and to be avoided."
1518,5,16-Oct,Australia,Lived up to the hype.,"As a little girl I ALWAYS wanted to go to Disneyland having grown up on The Mikey Mouse Show. This did not disappoint. Tokyo Disneyland really is the happiest place on earth. Everyone who worked there seemed genuinely happy. I did feel a little sorry for them as they had to wave constantly .We are staying in the Tokyo Disneyland Hotel so were able to skip the queue to enter. We did all the big scary rides - Big Thunder Mountain, spectacular! We rode it twice. Splash Mountain was great too. We did ""It's a Small World"" even tho we are teenagers and adults, it was lovely. Pooh's Hunny Hunt was also gorgeous and Space Mountain fast. We loved the parades and all four of us (59, 54, 17 and 15) had a spectacular time.10/10!!"
1519,5,16-Mar,Indonesia,Exciting!,"It may need 2 days to actually try all the rides. Park is definitely bigger than HK Disneyland, and also more exciting. The trick is getting all the fast passes for the main ride or you'll find yourself in 3 hour queue. Just before closing time i managed to try the haunted house (in daytime queue can took 3 hours), funny enough it was the only ride that my son (10months old at the time) didn't cry. Also love how Tokyo Disneyland made it easier for breastfeeding mom, they provide a room for to breastfed which consist of tiny sections with curtains to make it private (they don't do this at DisneySea).Maybe i missed the brochure, but in HK Disney i got all the details when and where the character would come out and take pictures, i got no information in Tokyo Disney. All the food are tasty and you should definitely try the Queen Of Heart Banquet Hall!"
1520,5,15-Nov,Indonesia,The best Disneyland in Asia,"It's worth to visit.. it is bigger than we thought.. Disneyland and Disneysea..If you want to try every attraction than you have to visit in two days.. We were staying in resort in the area, so we do not take a lot of time traveling here.."
1521,5,16-Sep,Australia,A lovely day,"We had previously been to both Anaheim and Orlando so we have an idea about Disney parks. Tokyo Disney was great. There weren't as many people as we were expecting so that was good. Fast passes are also very useful. Surprisingly all of the signs were in English first, followed by Japanese. We were able to communicate quite easily with cast members, by using our limited Japanese and hand signals. Typically for Disney, everything was clean and neat and all cast members were smiling non stop. Very easy to access using JR pass for two short train rides from Shinjuku. A great day and night. "
1522,5,16-May,India,the best disney land,"Tokyo disney land was my third disneyland, after America and Hongkong. What a place to visit in every way, enjoyed it to the max with my daughter, who had a gala time. Everything is perfect, the staff is so damn courteous that it left us mesmerised with Japanese culture, the highlight was disney electric parade, something very astonishing, and must see attraction, the food in disney land was not upto the mark in terms of pricing and quantity, its ridiculously expensive in comparison to outside. "
1523,4,16-Sep,Indonesia,"The Star Wars Simulator was amazing, made the day for me","OK, Space Mountain was all I needed to enjoy the day (rode twice) but the Star Wars simulator was just terrific, They have done a wonderful job on this experience - must do for all ages.  Other than that My only complaint is a standard one for Disneyland, too long a wait for popular rides (often more than an hour) and the complicated Fast pass just annoys me, it worked for one ride the next was nearly at park closing, we were worn out so gave the fast pass tickets to two youngsters."
1524,5,15-Oct,Australia,It's a Small World After All....,"This was an amazing place suited both to young and old. I loved it here. The atmosphere was awesome. The rides were fun and the ""fast passes"" are a great help to beat the queues. However I was unaware that you could only be in possession of one ""fast pass"" at any one time so plan out which rides you want to go on when. I also highly recommend trying to get free tickets to one of their theatre production shows. We stayed at a resort on the grounds of Disneyland and therefore were able to stay at the park all day. At night there is an impressive parade of illuminated floats of popular Disney characters as well as a fireworks display above Cinderella's Castle. The food was yummy and all very Disney-themed. I recommend Tokyo Disneyland to anyone visiting Tokyo. Next time I go to Japan I would like to visit Tokyo Sea which is just next door and has water themed rides and attractions."
1525,5,16-Aug,United Arab Emirates,Plan it for 2 Days if you have kids,"This is the place where the kids and adults enjoy at the same time.  The atmosphere is really magical. We spent 3 days in this park and still we couldn't do all the rides due to the heat and the crow.  So don't go during holidays or weekends.During August it was so hot and humid that the kids got tired very quickly. Be ready to do a lot of walking and don't forget the map which is distributed at the entrance gate.Understanding the express pass system will help you in utilizing your time efficiently as there is a time limit between each express pass. Moreover, you should know the popular attractions before coming to the park to set your priorities right otherwise its easy to be overwhelmed by the atmosphere."
1526,5,16-Sep,N/A,Happiness is Here!,"A Place you will never age! A lot of people wearing Disney princess costume! definitely the most happening and happiest place in the world . It is Halloween Theme the day I visit. Enjoy the walking and food there . Queue is long everywhere but it's not too long, and it is worth!"
1527,5,16-Sep,Indonesia,Indeed the happinest place on earth,Must see when you visit Tokyo...  But be careful when you coming.  Because on regular day not weekend or holiday it still so crowed. Remember to use the fast pass. 
1528,3,16-Sep,Australia,It's not California :-(,"Tokyo Disneyland was a decent day out. My teenage daughter enjoyed the day quite a lot, but we all felt that this is not a patch on Anaheim, where we went about 8 years ago. There are not that many rides, there are almost no characters walking around the park.  The rides were relatively tame. The parade was well done and the park is nice and clean. If you have never been to a Disneyland / Disney world etc or have younger kids, then this would be a better than average day. Naturally the voice overs etc are all in Japanese which detracts even more for non Japanese speakers. "
1529,5,16-Sep,Australia,Best Disneyland in the world - ,"Have now done every single park in the world -honestly for Aussies, save the money and the Jet-lag and just head to Tokyo Disney !!!! Awesome on so many levels  "
1530,5,16-Sep,Australia,Loved it!,Tokyo Disneyland is amazing nearly as good as the Anaheim park! Some rides in Japanese but that is expected as you are in Japan. Must stay for the night show as it is very different to the LA and Florida! As all Disney parks make sure to get Fastpasses in the morning so you don't have to wait in long queues for rides such as Astroblasters and Space Mountain.
1531,4,15-Oct,Malaysia,Great place but crowded,"There is quite a bit of walking required within the train stations to reach Disneyland. If you are staying at a Disneyland partner hotel, free shuttle busses are provided.Japanese love Disneyland and Mickey Mouse.Went during the Halloween period.There are some great rides in Disneyland but be prepared to wait in line.Impossible to cover everything so prioritise accordingly.Be aware there is a time limit before you can use your fast pass again.Book your place early on the pavement for the night floats.Overall the place is well maintained."
1532,5,16-Sep,Malaysia,Muslim travel to Disneyland,"Tokyo Disneyland is a great place for family get together. There were a lot of family rides with really awesome decorations and the scenic landscape of the disneyland castle, is the most magical above all. We were here end of summer, to our big surprise they opens at 8 a.m and close at 10 p.m. We bought our tickets online and it was a breeze at the entrance. Tokyo Disneyland allows food intended for a picnic, such as sandwiches, fruits, biscuits, your bottle of drinks etc, but I suppose not heavy meal. We could not find any halal food, hence please bring your picnic and tid-bits, ok. The one thing we enjoyed was the popcorn, they had many flavours, salty, butter, caramel, mocha, chocolate and surprisingly, curry too. Apart of the entire magical atmosphere, the parade is simply the best!!  They had a really long and colourful parade despite the rain, earlier of the day. (You should see the dedication, the staff put into clearing the traces of rain from the parade track, it was an overwhelming experience). Tokyo Disneyland, you are simply the best!"
1533,5,16-Sep,New Zealand,Great to see Disneyland with our Japanese host daugther,We visited on the 20th September and it rained the whole time. We used our tickets that we had got on line.First thing we did. Was buy a poncho for 1300Y. Everyone was wearing my hem and also using umbrellas.It was good to have our host daughter with us as we talked about the rides we wanted to do then she went and booked fast pass tickets for us.No charge and no waiting in long lines.Enjoyed all the rides and the two parades we saw but. It was so wet the night light show was cancelled.A great day all round apart from the rain.Japanese people very friendly and kind.
1534,4,16-Sep,Indonesia,F.U.N,"Buy your ticket before coming here. It's also available to buy in any Family Mart in Japan/Tokyo, through a machine (normally put next to the ATM). You can get the 1 day pass (whole day, from 3 PM, or from 6 PM), as well as the 2 days ticket. You can take the JR Line train to Maihama station. Than you can either walk to the Disneyland gate or take the Disney Resort Train start from ¬•130. This place is PACKED. Waiting line for a ride can vary from 40 mnt to 180 mnt. That aside there is a FastPass that you can get to avoid waiting line. Bring you ticket to the FastPass machine by the waiting line and scan your ticket. It'll give you the precise time when you can get into the ride without going to the waiting line. But the time might vary and might be 3 hours after you scan your ticket. And not all ride is available to use FastPass. 1 FastPass for 1 ride. So keep scanning your ticket. As it is a huge theme park, don't forget to refresh yourself. Restaurants and food is available everywhere. For muslims, I'd say no worries, non pork food is available. And menu's for vegetarian & special allergy is also available in most of their restaurant. Of course the staff doesn't speak english, soo brace yourself. Lost child service is located near the main entrance next to Monster Inc. If it's drizzling with rain the ride is still available (along with some disney poncho / umbrella)."
1535,4,16-Sep,Indonesia,Mickey vs Cosplay,"I think it's very common to see Mickey and friends in any Disney in the worlds. But here in Tokyo we will not only meet Mickey and friends but also enjoying to see Japanese Cosplay!Many people using cool costumes. At first I thought they were Disney staffs, but finally I knew that they were also visitors like me and fam! Ha ha I forget that this is Japan, the center of Cosplay.My teenagers were enjoy to see some rides, such as space mountain & star wars. Also enjoy to buy Disney souvenirs. For me and husband we enjoy to meet Japanese teenagers who use Cosplay. They use various costume from the common one like the Disney characters until unusual costume (for us). I though I will not see it in other Disney :)."
1536,5,16-Sep,Australia,magical,"you really need a 2 or 3 day pass, its so big and so magical. The rides are great and eating places are fun and delicious food. We had a great time even if it was only the one day. I wish I had spent longer there, perhaps stay in the Disney resort and have a pass for a few days so you don't miss out on anything. In Japan everyone dresses up as characters, people really go to all lengths and expense. It was so enjoyable to watch. truly magical."
1537,5,16-Sep,Australia,Happiest place on earth!!!,"I recently went to Tokyo Disney to celebrate my 30th birthday as I have always wanted to go to Disneyland! It was amazing. Nothing else can compare. I think the Japanese add something special (I've never been to another Disney) as the patience, courtesy and orderly nature of the Japanese makes waiting in lines and dealing with crowds pleasurable.The staff were all amazing. So kind and focused on helping you plus happy!! Always smiling and making you feel great. The happiness is hear parade was a highlight for us (we watched it twice). Such a high caliber performance which can't be missed.We purposefully went mid week in September to avoid crowds and the park was busy but totally manageable. Making use of the fast pass system meant we never waited more than 20 minutes for a ride. In our first day we rode about 15 rides!I can't wait to go back again one day so this was such a highlight! "
1538,5,16-Sep,N/A,Had a blast,"Been to Hong Kong an now Tokyo Disney. Pretty much the same standard in my opinion however a few more people at Tokyo. The crowd is certainly much more fanatical at tokyo, appeared to be 90% Japanese and mostly dressed up in their Disney outfits. This kind of adds to the atmosphere and makes the day a little more special. We enjoyed the Pirates of the Caribbean the most, but all the river cruises are worth a look. I was happy with the crowds, on a Saturday and I expected it to be busier than it was. Typically 45-60 minute waits for rides, but some down to around 20. My tip is bring some water and snacks, keep your empty water bottles as there are plenty of refill stations around the park."
1539,4,16-Aug,Australia,Never been - so glad I did!,"Bought tickets in Australia before I went.- They get printed out in Japanese, requested English, but they come in Japanese. Caught train there and walked with hundreds to the entrance gates. Go straight through the main ticket area and walk past the bag inspection.Go to the main entrance (which is what we didn't do and waited over an hour in the ticket line - as advised by a helper after we showed her our tickets) It was then we were told we should walk straight to the main entrance. Once inside -One of our party ran off to get tickets to what we wanted to see and was given a time - you can only do this once . It registers your ticket somehow so you can't book rides all over the place. When that time has gone then you can go and book another ride. Since our first ride time was early afternoon. we waited in line for 2 hours to go on a 3 minute ride  Buzz Lightyear. In hindsight would probably just walk around - enjoy the sights,  as when we went on our pre booked ride - we walked past Buzz Light year again and there was only 1/2 hour wait. Rained the day we went, so thought it wouldn't be so crowded - wrong! You have to go early however as they close the gates once the maximum amount of people are in.Saying all that - it was an experience and so glad I went. Only so many rides are suitable for little ones - so do your homework first to have a plan and to what area you need to go. It's huge place.I tried to pre book a speciality restaurant for lunch - but they were all booked out. Book these months in advance if that's what you want to do."
1540,5,16-Jul,Philippines,A must-do for any Disney fan!,"This park seems to be designed particularly for a younger crowd, i.e. kids, but it's still very enjoyable for us kids-at-heart! Expect to walk a lot and line up at long queues but this is expected at any major theme park.Food is allowed inside (small bites like sandwiches and onigiri are best; it's highly inconvenient to bring in rice meals) so if you're looking to save a little, bring your own snacks! There's plenty of water in the park though.It rained during our trip but surprisingly, we still had tons of fun! The rains, in fact, make the rides a little bit more exciting.Best savings for visitors when tickets are booked online and for multiple days (meaning one day for Disneyland, and another for Disney SEA), so go ahead and grab tickets from their website!"
1541,5,16-Aug,Philippines,Happiness is truly here!!!,"It really feels like a child when you go to Disneyland. Easy access even a long walk from the main train station, like 15-20 minutes.  Bigger than HK Disneyland. It rains when we were there but many stalls locations you can go when it rains.  Food prices were competitive almost same as food price the Tokyo Prefecture.  The parade at 4:45pm was very nice."
1542,5,16-Sep,United States,True Disney Magic!,"I live in Southern California and was raised on the Disneyland in Anaheim. Disney parks will always hold a special place in my heart. Recently and for the first time I visited Tokyo Disneyland. In a nutshell; take the best attributes of Disneyland in California and the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World, amplify the ride technology and the attention to detail, bring the customer service and cleanliness levels to a +10 while capturing true Disney magic=Tokyo Disneyland! The only downside is Tokyo Disneyland is an extremely popular place in Japan. Wait times for a attractions and food can be a little unbearable and they do not sell diet soda ( a main staple for most Americans). But the cast members do an outstanding job of crowd control while maintaining an extremely polite, friendly, and professional attitude. Definitely go on weekdays (Tues. Wed. Thurs. are best) and stay away during Japanese holidays and weekends. Take full advantage of the park's fast pass system. If you are a true Disney park fan and happen to be in Tokyo, you must visit! You'll love it. Walt would've very proud to have his name stamped on this park!"
1543,4,16-Sep,N/A,Long walk into the entrance,"Be sure to walk a lot. Compared to HK and Paris, this is the more better one because its much more interesting. I feel like there's more rides and shows then the others.Same like the others, they only speak Japanese in the theme parks.Variety of food inside. No outside food allowed.Get a discount for buying Disneyland and disneysea tickets. One day after another, no splitting of dates.Some rides you can register to get a ticket and come back for the ride later to join the queue so that you can go do other stuff."
1544,4,15-Oct,Bhutan,Tokyo Disneyland,"Very nice place though quite far from Tokyo city as such. Please go as early as possible, because there could be huge queues everywhere. People will certainly go with kids so make a good plan to cover the activities in series so you do not have to make your kids run to and fro because they will get tired by the time the most interesting parts come."
1545,5,16-Sep,N/A,Must visit,"This is the place where u enjoy with your family, children etc. You have to plan in advance. Otherwise very crowded. Reach there before opening and try to do first ride without fast pass. Try and use all 4 fast pass. You will surely enjoy."
1546,5,16-Mar,Malaysia,It was memorable. Must go for Tokyo trip,I grew up with Disneyland so it was amazing have a chance step in the Tokyo disneyland. The most fun is Tokyo Disneyland Electrical paradise show. It was beautiful and amazing. Suggest to buy the fast passed. It's worth it.
1547,5,16-Aug,United Kingdom,A Great Summers Day,"Been to Florida, Been to Paris and Now been to Tokyo...how does Tokyo hold up to it's counterparts? Pretty well actually as it's rather similar in many ways but it can also differ! Rides are rides and well food was decent but overall, it was a fantastic day, plenty to do and the price was decent which says a lot about Disney...decent price....not over priced for a change....was surprised by that! My wife wants to see all of the Disney's on the planet so I'm glad to get Tokyo done! Jam packed as you expect! Long queues for many rides, more so in the afternoon really. 8/10 in the end, come and have a fun day at Disney with your family, friends etc young or adult, you'll find something fun here."
1548,5,15-Dec,United States,Awesome winter fun!,"Been to this park few times and on every Tokyo trip. Last time we went in Dec to experience it in the Winter and Christmas mood - it was an awesome experience for the family + kids! The Xmas decoration was so enchanting and everything was even more magical during this festive season. The queues for the rides were long as usual and park was busy even on weekday as dec was a Japan school holiday too. Advise to go early and as park allows re-entry, you can go back to hotel for a quick needed rest before heading back again in the evening for more fast past rides, dinner and watch the parade + firework! "
1549,5,16-Sep,Australia,Good fun,Had a great time at Disney land mid week visit crowds were down no waiting for ride and attractions very lucky if going by the line up facilities they have.Got there 12pm and spend a very happy 5 hrs. Used the train to arrive from Tokyo and return very easy station to the entrance a 5 min walkCould spend a lot of time there 5 hrs was plenty for us  but because of the low numbers we didn't waste time queuing  up With kids it would be a all day trip
1550,5,15-Dec,Australia,A fantastic day,"I've been to Tokyo Disneyland twice now. Once during their summer, and once on Christmas Eve 2015. I don't know why people complain about needing 2 days, as both times I've managed to do everything with hours to spare.The secret is simply being smart. Use the fast passes when they become available and if you see a ride with a reasonable wait time, line up. Don't bother with a fast pass for later, just get in line. 40 mins is as short a wait as you will get on popular rides so if you see it, take it.The park will always be jam packed, but people in Japan (and especially their kids) are so pleasant and well behaved that it's not an overly frustrating experience. Even waiting in line is bearable. I wouldn't call the rides 'thrill' rides. They're pretty tame, but are certainly still enjoyable.Everybody raves about monsters inc. (and it is the first ride to sell out of fast passes) but in my opinion poohs hunny hunt and the haunted mansion are the highlights. The jungle cruise I missed last time but I'm glad I opted to give it a shot this time around because it surprised me how enjoyable it was.If you're lucky enough to visit the park around a themed holiday (for us it was Christmas) the park feels so much more special. The haunted mansion was themed with the nightmare before Christmas, and was a lot more fun than last time I went on it (with no theme). The parades were also Christmas themed, and the whole park was decorated. It made it more magical. Make sure you stay for the dream lights parade and the final night show in front of the castle. It is an intensely long day, but they are amazing."
1551,5,15-Dec,Singapore,Themes park for kids,"We enjoyed our day there but the themes park is for kids , I guess. More of the kids activity. We didn't had a chance to go to the Disneysea. Turkey there was a bit tough , I didn't like it."
1552,5,16-Mar,United Kingdom,Disney with a eastern twist.,"Firstly this park is always busy. The Japanese love there theme parks and it shows so do not turn up at any time of the year and expect to get everything done in a day or even two. We went at peak time (cherry blossom time) and a 420 minute queue was possable. Saying that at park opening and most of the day was busy we found that in the last hour of opening we mange lots, on one day we managed 4 ride in that last hour due to people leaving to travel home. If you like disney you will love it. If you do your homework before visiting you will not be disapointed."
1553,3,16-Sep,Singapore,Worse theme park experience... ,"To begin with, I always write reviews in tripadvisor to share the experience for travel‚Ä¶ Mostly good reviews as I always manage my own expectations‚Ä¶I'm giving a 3 out of 5 because there's still many other staff whom were helpful and nice.I'm had been to theme parks in some countries and I'm not new to Japan or the theme park... It's my 3rd time to the theme park‚Ä¶I've never felt so offended in a Theme Park or in Japan!My visit to the Disneyland Tokyo last Friday was the most terrible encounter apart from the usual theme park issues such as long queue and announcement from Staff are always in Japanese... for some rides, there's pre-recorded English announcements... but not for Meet & Greet... However, the staff will try their best to communicate nicely with their limited English.We went to queue at the Meet & Greet at Mickey's House...Every Meet & Greet I went I noticed that the Locals are allow to take a photo of just the Character using their own camera.So, I requested to do the same as the set/background was beautiful and not wanting to jam the queue, I just wanted to do a quick snap n go...The staff got very angry ( from her body language ), she stretched out her hand in front of my mobile phone, seems like trying to cover or snatch my phone. Then she started saying ""No, no, no, no..."" (4 ""No"")....Thinking that it could be that her capabilities in English is limited, I tried to explain just Mickey that I'm taking. She continued her ""No, No, No,..."" (Now louder and angrier in her tone)So my sister tried to explain to her and says that because we always see people allowed to take.Guess what?Her reply was ‚Äú with their camera ‚Äú and started using her fingers to point‚Ä¶More importantly, we were just trying to reason things out nicely with her‚Ä¶ yet, we got reply from her in a louder and rude tone plus body language.She was so RUDE that she spoilt my happy mood on a theme park day and her colleague whom was holding the SLR camera for taking the official photo has to apologize to us.Yet there is no apology from the rude staff whom was rude.As there's no point talking sense to unreasonable person, hence we walked away.I'm so disappointed and offended by her behavior. However, it feels as though the treatment towards local and non Japanese speaking tourist is different!Indeed, it could be a one off incident when we are pure unlucky to meet a no manners person during our trip.It's a birthday trip for my sister, our intention was to stayed in the theme park for the whole day but the mood was spoilt. Instead of staying a full day, we hanged around for a little longer buying souvenirs then we left. From this experience, I'm not going back to Disneyland Tokyo."
1554,4,16-Sep,United States,Very similar to Disneyland in U.S.,We enjoyed our day here even with the rain. It wasn't very crowds the day we went so we didn't have to wait in line for a long time to get on the rides. All the talking rides are in Japanese so unless you speak good Japanese you will not know what they are saying. Most of the rides were same as what we have here in the states. We found that very few employees spoke English so brush up on your Japanese before going. 
1555,4,15-Dec,Australia,Very long waiting time,"We visited this park on December and it was very very busy. We had to queue up for more than 2 hours for some of the popular rides. It's recommended to go during off peak season to maximize the Disney experience. Having said that, we still had a good time. We enjoyed the rides, the food, and all the shows. "
1556,5,16-Aug,Singapore,Loved it,I feel in love again with disney. I had been to HK disney and was very disappointed but with Disneyland Tokyo I fell in love again.It took us 4 hrs just to take a look and click pics.Please note we had not taken any rides. We were two adults so if you are with kids I would really recommend you stay in disney land or have two days pass at least.Make sure u wear matching stuff or have anything that is matching with theme. Japanese are very serious about disney you will see every one in nice theme t-shirts or dress and couple dresses. I read this thing in trip advisor I would thank to that person to mention it. Me and my husband got our self matching t-shirts to go with it and felt so good when we saw every one wearing it.Parade is great mostly in Japanese but you will understand its beautiful.
1557,5,16-Jan,Australia,A great day :),"Visited in Jan with my 2 kids, aged 12 and 10. Was a freezing cold day but it was so much fun. All rides, areas were open- was fantastic, We had so much fun :)"
1558,3,16-Aug,Australia,Good Average,The layout is much the same as another Disney I have visited. I was disappointed there were no Disney characters around the park . Micky and Minnie were inside the front gate for about 40 minutes and that was it if they had been around the park it would have felt like Disneyland. Lines to buy food were long.  Lot of shady areas. 
1559,5,15-Sep,Australia,Awesome,"Been to Hong Kong Disney and Anaheim but this place was just amazing ! I loved it, my husband and 3 kids. We went on a Tuesday . Yes it was busy but we worked out the fast pass and what we wanted to do and we had an absolute ball. We got there at 9.30 am and left at 8.45pm. Kids still wanted to stay. Best atmosphere and just really an awesome to place to visit to make life long family memories."
1560,5,15-Dec,Japan,The place where I will always be Child ,"Like many of us , we just want to experience our childhood again .  If you go to Japan make a point to visit the Tokyo Disney world . You will not be disappointed and it just perfect for rekindle your childhood again .I enjoyed every moment of it and the atmosphere is different very colourful with many of the Japanese who visit the place really do dress up to the occasion . It's not cheap as its about USD 72 for 1 day pass . But believe me you will enjoy every moment of it, please do go early and enjoy the show , the parade and fireworks at night . I made sure I was early , enjoyed the day shows and the night shows ... So when your there don't miss out ya ...."
1561,5,15-Sep,United States,Highlight of our trip!,"I spent a few years working and living in Japan (specifically in Chiba-ken), and to finish off my time living there, I invited my family to see a few of the sights. Disneyland was amazing! There are a few rides in common with California, but each are unique in their own way! A few of my favorites were Tower of Terror, Indiana Jones, and Raging Spirits. Stitch's Tiki Room is also a must see. Definitely split Disneyland and Sea up onto separate days."
1562,4,16-Aug,South Korea,Better Than Expected,"We were very worried about visiting Tokyo Disney in late August because of the lines, but we were pleasantly surprised. We were able to do 14 rides with the longest waiting time being 25 minutes and using 2 fast passes. Staff were very friendly and courteous and made a great effort to communicate despite our lack of Japanese and their lack of Korean/English. The park is very very very clean and well organized, and it was easy to get around the park. The only problem we faced was that they seem to make it almost impossible to book a meal reservation at a Disney restaurant if you are a foreigner living outside of Japan. In the end, we managed to do so by using a Japanese name and the address of our hotel, but Disney needs to be more considerate of visitors trying to make plans to visit from outside of Japan."
1563,5,16-Jul,N/A,All-time Favorite Children Playgrounds,Best destination for family holiday. Especially for children between 3-15 years old. Most rides are suitable for those ages period. The only regret was it's always crowded during the holiday season which makes the queue unbearable. There was even a wait-time of 160 minutes for a ride. It would be an unforgettably amazing memory if there was no such problems. The food was acceptable. Best facilities among all other Theme Parks in the world.
1564,5,16-May,Australia,Absolutely beautiful Disney Park,"I have been to Disney parks in Paris, California and Orlando and can say this is the cleanest and most friendly park I have been to! All the staff are very friendly and helpful.I loved all the rides and the array of characters you could meet. They have a great range of merchandise and sweets you can buy to take home including really cute popcorn holders.I was lucky enough to be proposed to in front of Cinderella's castle so this will always be a very magical place for my partner and I."
1565,4,16-Aug,N/A,Well organized show/rides easy to go around ,Only downside is too many patiently waiting people. Suppose without typhoon there will be much more riders 
1566,5,16-Jun,United States,EarlyJune is best time to visit,"No crowds in the morning or last two hours in the evening at Disney Tokyo. We went on 20 rides in one day; wait time no more than 20 minutes. Walking the 200 yards (maximum) to and from the Disney Hotel is a luxury. Our hotel room was large and the beds were comfortable. Transportation on monorail - which is about 200 feet from the hotel, is included in price of room. First class hotel.School is still in session, through the end of June, and it was so nice to enjoy an uncrowded park.Staff/employees, even with limited English skills only want to make certain everything you ask about is taken care of. Would return in a heart beat."
1567,5,16-Aug,United States,Great time at Tokyo Disneyland!,"If you like Disneyland in the US, you will like Tokyo Disneyland.   Its really easy to get to from the Tokyo Subway system.   One of the ways that we got there was via the Yurakucho line.   You get off on at Shin-Kiba (end of the line) and then transfer to the Keiyo Line and get off at Maihama.   If you get confused, follow the Japanese kids in Shin-Kiba.   If you have been to the London Tube, Paris Metro, Munich Metro, etc, you will have no problems finding your way here.   Also, its in English so you shouldn't have any problems.We went on Friday, Aug 19th.  There are 2 lines....1 to buy tickets and another to get into the park.   The ticket sales start around 7am and the gates open at 8am.  If you have 2 people or more, have 1 person buy the tickets while another stands in line.We wanted to see the shows so we went to Tomorrowland and got the passes for the shows.  Its a lottery system and you might get the show you want or you might not.   We got the first show which was Sairyo Kabu...it was a great show that resembled a Bon Dance.   If you go to this show, make sure that you bring a bag to put your stuff in as water is sprayed on you.   We were drenched but it was great as it was super hot around 10am.We rode Space Mountain, Star Tours (this was updated to include scenes from the latest Star Wars:  The Force Awakens), got a fast pass to the Monsters Inc ride (similar to Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blaster), Pirates of the Caribbean, Small World, etc.   We tried the Soy Sauce and butter popcorn...delicious as well as had lunch at Grandma Sara's kitchen.We left around 6pm while the park closed at 10pm.   Its a great park with things that you can't get anywhere else such as the Kimono Mickey stuffed dolls, etc.If you have time, go to Tokyo Disneyland for a different flavor of the happiest place on earth."
1568,5,16-Aug,United Kingdom,Amazing,Loved it here! but i may be biast as my fiance proposed me to there! waits for rides are a little long but worth it! Get the fast pass tickets for the rides you are desperate to get on! you can get one fast pass ticket every two hours so go early and get the favourite ride first then after two hours second favourite etc
1569,5,16-Aug,Indonesia,Tokyo Disneyland,It was so hot during this sunny summer day. Various Disney attraction available. Don't forget to get some Disney merchandise at the shop
1570,5,16-Aug,United States,Loved it!,"If you've enjoyed Disneyland Anaheim, then you'll like Tokyo Disneyland. Includes many of the same rides and a few great additions. We were here during peak summer season, so this place was packed! But luckily with careful planning and the use of fast passes, we enjoyed the park with no issues. Unfortunately while we were here there was a thunder storm and a power outage. All rides closed for about 2 hours and everyone was required to take shelter. The staff was very diligent that everyone was inside buildings and away from any danger. Lots of signs in English, staff speak limited English, but still very helpful. Many of the shows and dialogue in the rides are in Japanese, but still extremely enjoyable."
1571,5,15-Dec,France,A Disney parc with Japanese kindness and way to organize,"Yes it is a Disney Parc. But with the Japaneese organisation, kidness and service oriented mind. Even in Christmas season we were able to participate to more attraction than in others parcs of the same group. In fact, two Disney parcs exists in this nearest Tokyo neighbourhood, Tokyo Disney sea beeing a kind of Japan exclusive. However, due to the season weather we choose the more ""classic"" on and were not desapointed."
1572,5,16-Jul,United States,A Lovely Magic Kingdom,"After visiting the DisneySea the day before, we took in Tokyo DisneyLand the next day.  We bought 2-day tickets at our Hotel prior to going ($132). We were immediately greeted by the World Bazaar -- which is Main Street under a glass roof!  This turns out to be a really excellent idea for Japan.  It has all the usual gift shops we have in the US. By the way, we are WDW experts and so it didn't bother us that we might not get in every ride, show or parade at TDL. Anyway, we got there as soon as it opened and immediately headed for Star Tours and Space Mountain.  We picked up fastpasses for Space Mountain and headed to Star Tours, which never seemed to have a line so early on a Sunday morning.  We rode Star Tours 4 times that day.  My kids wanted to see the different 'stories', of course these are all in Japanese.  But Star Tours in Japanese is possibly more fun than Star Tours in English.  Space Mountain was great - the usual in the dark roller coaster ride.  Eventually we left Tomorrowland and headed for the other lands.  We rode Pirates of the Caribbean -- which strangely seemed to be mostly in English. But the Jungle Boat ride was hoot - because we did not understand anything.  But the ride was the same, so we knew what our guide was doing on the Volta Val.  Of course, it poured rain while we were there.  I bought a poncho that I never wore.  We made it into a dozen other attractions by judicious use of the fastpass.  Unlike DisneySea, we found bottled water everywhere.  Disney is great and TDL is a wonderful way to appreciate a major US export!!"
1573,5,16-Aug,China,"Lovely, Clean and Amazing Shows",Every theme park has their rollercoasters but not every theme park has similar shows that Disney can offer!  Our family enjoyed those shows very much!  They brought adults back to their childhood and excited the kids a lot!
1574,5,15-Sep,N/A,Salim ,It's an amazing place with kids. They have fun all day long. Disney is done a fantastic setup. The shows are just fantastic 
1575,4,16-Jul,Philippines,Happiest place in the world,I love disneyland this is the happiest place in the world.. Language used in the park is not english.. So we did not understand the narration and instructions..
1576,3,16-Aug,United Kingdom,"Okay, just okay","Similar to my review of Tokyo Disneysea I'm afraid. Water availability needs work, should be available at every kiosk not just random ones. Stewards with characters need to manage the crowd so that everyone gets seen instead of a free for all. One good side to this park was that queue times weren't too bad, there were a couple at about 2hr wait but only 2 of the big rides which was a pleasant surprise. Would recommend this park. "
1577,5,16-Jul,Australia,Wish I could get lost there,"Literally, I had the best day of my life there. It is amazing. (I bet all Disneyland are but I have only been to this one). If you go there make sure to go thePirates of the Caribbean section. Also, there is a restaurant at this section which needs reservation in advance (unfortunately we did not know and missed it). Try to get to the park very soon and get the Fast Pass for the sections that have FP, especially Monsters Factory which is veryyyy busy."
1578,5,16-Apr,Australia,"Go on a Monday, not as busy, but very worth the money","We went back in April 2016 and visited on a Monday.  I have read a lot of reviews that place can get busy, so we decided to go on a Monday as suggested by other reviewers.  Best decision ever.  Look it was busy, but we are from Melbourne and have done shopping close to Christmas, so comparing it to that, it was quiet! This was our first time to any Disneyland and we were not disappointed!  Worth the value for money, and it is an experience in itself.  We will be going back for sure! Japan was probably the best place to go to Disneyland cause of the cleanliness and extremely lovely people.  Really great for children too!"
1579,3,15-Sep,United Kingdom,Nice but really crowded. For adults only not worth it.,It was my very first experience for Disneyland so can't compare to another!! So first impressions was it looks absolutely amazing and pretty big as well. Transportation was easy which direct trains to the venue. I miss Disney as a child so I was excited the view were amazing but what I did not like were the queues and the rides were generally for kid (yes yes it's Disney) the quiet were way too long and over an hour to get on a ride which in the end was not worth the price...Everything was in Japanese (yes yes am in Japan) but just letting you know. It super crowded as well but does have it's quiet spots. Disney sea I didn't get was next door but just as expensive so did not bother as this is definitely more for kids..teenagers might not be that impressed I feel should have gone years ago lol      
1580,5,16-Aug,Malaysia,one day is not enough,"Amazing! as you would expect at Disneyland. Very helpful staffs, even if you dont speak their language. Very clean and pleasant. Went in summer, so not such a big crowd, and not such long wait for rides."
1581,5,15-Dec,Singapore,Enjoyable Theme Park,The theme park is indeed a great location for young and old alike. It has good attractions. Offers prayer room for muslims. One of the best service in the world!
1582,5,16-Aug,N/A,Disney World with a japanese twist,The part has most of the classics from Disney world but there is plenty of little twists that make it unique to Japan. Be sure to try the different popcorn flavors. My favorite is soy and butter!
1583,5,16-Jul,Japan,It's Disneylad!,"What can I say? It's Disneyland! Personally I am not sure if I was lucky enough but the longest line  I got was for 60 minutes! So, I was able to do almost all rides. I went on Saturday after 3pm and I was expecting just to get 2 rides and the parade. But I was able to do 3 main rides plus another  don't know how many rides! Unbelievable :)I really enjoyed Disneyland. Service is good, ambience is nice, well..all I can say it's Disneyland!!!!"
1584,5,16-Jun,N/A,Everything you would expect,"This is an amazing place with all your favourite Disney characters packed into a neatly assembled, well organised and super clean park in true Japanese style. My 5yo had a brilliant time here as did my wife and I!We found the wait for rides not particularly long (never more than half an hour) and were never frustrated with the crowds. However, it probably really helps to go on a weekday outside of school holidays which we did. Rides and service at the park were amazing. Food was ok and probably better than the theme park average but still not outstanding. We ate at several different places. We only did one day and can see why people choose to stay at the park and visit multiple days - there is so much to do and one day simply isn't enough. In hindsight I would have booked a hotel at the park or in the bay area for a few nights and then gone to Tokyo after that. It would save the travel time and cost and allow you to get the most out of an amazing theme park!Note that all the rides / speech is in Japanese. You can still understand what is going on but quite strange for the western visitor to see your favourite characters taking in a different language!It's a long day but a huge amount of fun. Be prepared to be tired at the end! "
1585,5,16-May,Austria,"I felt like a child again, great time worth it.","We went there only once /May 2008/ and I cant compare to other Disneylands, it was my first experience with Disney. I felt like in a magic land. We tried almost all the attractions, because as all in Japan it feels so safe. U can see the Japanies perfection and high-tech everywhere. The only bad thing about this park is the amount of people and waiting time in the lines. But it worth the waiting. We had such a great time, a lot of fun, great food and next time I would think about to buy VIP card to avoid waiting in the lines."
1586,5,16-Jul,Federated States of Micronesia,"Like the magic kingdom, but in japan!","carbon copy of the magic kingdom (maybe smaller scale?). We spent a day here, and did most of the rides. Queues were smaller than usa, make good use of the fast pass. Train station 200 meters from park, so easy access. Enjoyable day"
1587,3,16-Aug,United States,pretty good ,"All the rides are really fun. The only bad thing is the lines are very long. If you can go, go in the evening. Also in the summer definitely bring a small fan. "
1588,4,16-Mar,Australia,Magical,"Tokyo Disneyland was a truly Magical experience. Everything lived up to the hype, even the crowds unfortunately! Still worth a visit, no matter what age!!"
1589,4,16-Jul,Indonesia,Great family park,"We were so lucky, and happy has visited this place. It was so suitable for kids. We have finished almost all the rides. And as a parent, i really satisfied to see the smile on our kids faces werent faded until we left the park . Surely be back here next trip.."
1590,3,16-Jul,India,Okay,"I may be biased because I am not a fan of kid stuff. I think this place is of interest for children only. A musical parade of Disney characters was good but other than that, the place was just okay."
1591,4,16-Jun,India,Magical experience,"Disneyland is always magical. And so was this one. My daughter finally moved on from princesses to exploring and enjoying other rides. Both the parades were lovely.....as was ""Once upon a time"". Just wish more vegetarian food options were available. "
1592,5,15-Oct,Brazil,Worth it!,"It is worth the visit! In weekdays you will have more chances to ride.I went in the Halloween and totally reccomend it. It is full and packed, lot of lines for the attractions (but Star Wars was Always 15 mins.). But the big deal at Halloween is the costumes! People dressed as characters, great costumes, it was really fun and enjoyable.If you can, stay in a nearby hotel. When the Park closes, the trains get full (but Japanese are polite and the trains are ok).I think it is a memorable experience, even if you don't speak Japanese.Safe for solo too.I pretend to go back. "
1593,5,16-Jun,United States,An amazing mix of 'normal' and 'special' rides and parades,The afternoon and evening parades were better than the Magic Kingdom's.  Here they just seemed to 'plus' everything.  There were some of the 'normal' Disney park rides and some were so much better.  Winnie the Pooh was amazing and fun! Monsters Inc was a ride and shoot that the kids enjoyed.  We are already planning our next trip back!
1594,2,16-Aug,Argentina,"Like the other disney parks in the world, only smaller and with longer queues","I've been to disney theme parks in orlando, california and paris. This, I have to say, was the worst one.Even if it is small (so supposedly more easily managed) it's very badly organized. Huge queues for everything you can fathom: bathrooms, eating, getting the actual tickets. I won't even mention the attractions/rides. The wait time/ride ratio is insane. They have this ""fast pass"" policy that allows you to get ""quickly"" (quickly meaning less than 30 minutes) into attractions that you can get every three hours, so you can get ""quickly"" into 3 or 4 rides a day, tops. yay.having lunch/dinner is also a queue fest. I don't really get how this place manages to stay open.I had a good time because I was in good company, but I thought ""what if I had kids and had brought them here?"" it'd be ridiculously frustrating. wouldn't recommend, really. stay out of here."
1595,4,16-Aug,Argentina,Typical Disney fun,"We live Disney parks and didn't want to miss Tokyo Disneyland It was hot August day, but not as crowded as we expected. Fun doing Disney favorites but all in Japanese. If you like Disney, you will enjoy a full day here. "
1596,5,15-Sep,Japan,Fun Day,"You can spend a fun day in Tokyo Disneyland. The entrance ticket is only for this park, not for DisneySea. The make it very clear. There are many shops inside, and some rides. But same as everywhere in Tokyo, really crowded. The food, on the other hand, is really cheap. We decided to go on a cloudy day so we could bare the sun and it was the best decision we made."
1597,4,16-Feb,Malaysia,good family theme park,The staffs were helpful and polite in giving direction and nursing room is well equipped.Park amenities are well maintained.
1598,2,16-Jul,China,It is Disney - and u get what you expect,"Second time here. Now the kids are older.It was sunny - great. It was a boiling hot day - not so great.Like any other theme parks, if weather is too hot - there simply is nowhere to hide. This Disney has a good no of F&B outlets but u can't go too frequently. U will go bankrupt.Star Tour is a must. It really was exciting and v real.There is a Disneyland and a Disneysea. This is where the problem lies. I really don't like fact there are merchandise that they sell only here and not there, and vice verse. Not everyone have time to go to both. My girl was very disappointed she could not get the Duffy merchandise she really was looking forward to buy.  Surely there are other ways of trying to get visitors to go to both..... But for this aspect - this Disney will get a much higher rating. It's clean, the crowd civilised and not overly expensive. "
1599,2,16-Jun,Philippines,There are things you need to know!,"It is very disappointing, it is impossible for you to ride all the rides both in disneyland and disneysea. You will be needing a 2 days or more for each park. So that would be a total of 4 to 5 days. So that's the reason they are offering 2 to 3 days of park pass. The line in each ride is very long, you are lucky if you will only wait for 1 hour just to ride a 5 minutes ride, how frustrating. They have this express pass, you need to validate your ticket for the pass. and wait for another 2 or more hours to get another pass for another ride. For example, If you are going to get your fastpass for ""indiana jone ride"" at around 10am you can use the pass at around 11:15am, what are you going to do for that 1 hour interval? go to another ride? or better yet get another fastpass on the other rides? both not possible. As I said earlier it will that more than 1 hour for you to ride, your fastpass is already due and won't be able to use it anymore. you cannot get another Fastpass to different ride until your done with your first fastpass. I find this Fastpass useless. check the weather before going, make sure that the weather is good, you will be wasting your time if it is not. what you can do is ride a 2-3 rides and just walk around the park for pictures, sightseeing, and eating(even foods have long lines).I am this disappointed, because i have to other disneyland and their system are far more better. TOKYO DISNEYLAND AND DISNEYSEA NEED TO WORK THEIR SYSTEM TO MAKE IT ""THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH""."
1600,4,16-Jul,United Arab Emirates,Fantastic parks but language can be a problem,"Everything you'd expect from Disney at both Disneyland and DisneySea - great rides and shows - fantastic family entertainment and sore feet from so much walking.  OK - most of the rides commentary is in Japanese but not the end of the world and acceptable given I'd estimate 90%+ are Japanese visitors and you can get by without English commentary most of the timeOnly one con - very difficult to reserve any restaurants in advance unless you speak Japanese, can use a Japanese credit card and use the Japanese language only website - come on Disney - this is the only area you let yourselves down and not difficult to create a multi-lingual site today - please !!"
1601,5,16-Jul,United Kingdom,Stay Nearby,"I have now visited 10 out of the 12 Disney parks and I have to say this is my favourite. This comes down to the people, not just the cast members but the people visiting. Unlike other parks in Paris or U.S this place is 99% Japanese people. We stayed nearby which meant we got to take a break and go back, unlike in the U.S, this only took us 20mins and we were back in our hotel room. On the downside we purchased a 3 day pass and you must go 3 consecutive days and specify which park you are going to for the first 2 days. Most rides, shows etc are in Japanese as you would expect,  but this only enhanced the experience, Jungle Cruise and Stitch interaction inJapanese were a treat. Dont know if this was just on the day we went but the shops before closing just couldn't keep up with the merchandise flying off the shelves, never seen empty shelves in a Disney Theme Park before. Natsu Matsuri water show is great, watching people getting absolutely drenched."
1602,5,16-Jul,United States,Both familiar and unique Disney experience,We have been to many disney parks and are clearly board towards them.  This park offers a familiar experience as well as a unique experience which will be enjoyed by any Disney afficianado. The Pooh ride is very different and quite impressive.   There is a monsters Inc ride which is unique.  The fantasyland rides include old favorites like Pinocchio gone from the united states.  Tomorrowland offers other familiar rides are does adventurousness but all have subtle twists.  Highly recommended.   
1603,5,15-Dec,Singapore,Top notch Disneyland!,Really love this Disneyland. Although the queues were super super long so we did not finish going on all the rides. But good excuse to come back againÔºÅ
1604,3,16-Jul,N/A,3 wonderful days,"After spending 3-days in Disneyland and sea, I am still physically exhausted - my 3.5 years-old cannot handle all the walk and was often bored by the trolly so I have to carry him much of the time, but it so worths it. Disneyland is disneyland, never disappointed me before and surely not this time. There are two inconveniences we encountered: 1) most of the attractions do not have English narratives; 2) there is no power outlet anywhere inside the theme park to recharge my iPhone (our primary image capturing device) and the staff refused to let us use the shops outlet. An advice to give is to bring your own portable power bank."
1605,5,16-Jul,China,perfect for all ages,"i have been here for more than 10 years ago with my girlfriend, and now became my wife. we took our son to visit tokyo disney and the kid's very happy. but maybe this is the second time i visit, i find that tokyo disney is not as big as i thought..."
1606,5,16-Jul,Singapore,A place for all ages,"My family and I visited Tokyo Disneyland in early July, the beginning of their summer.There is good sunshine. The place is very welcoming. People of all ages will become a 'child' again when they step inside the Disneyland. It just blew away all your everyday ""grind and worry"". You just want to enjoy the place. The staff of Disneyland are very friendly. Although they may not speak fluent English, their hand gestures are enough to answer your query. They feel a part of the establishment and proud of it. Even, I asked the cleaner who sweeping up the trash for direction, he can and very keen to show me the correct direction. There are many sitting arrangements in the park, so elderly can always find a seat if they need one. There are good restaurants inside the park too. This is something I always desired when visiting parks. I want a good and proper lunch with my family. This Tokyo Disneyland do provide that and the prices are very reasonable, comparable to restaurants at other places. I strongly recommend anyone to eat at the restaurant to enjoy the full experience of the park. The attractions are more kiddy friendly as compare to DisneySea, so the whole family can enjoyed the rides together. Make sure to watch the Disney Parade of the day, which they called ""Happiness is here"", which is rightly so. If you can stay into the evening, then that will be better as there will be some evening performance around the castle. It is amazing. It is definitely worth the trip there."
1607,5,16-Apr,Australia,Amazing time with the family,"We visited Tokyo Disneyland in April 2016. We booked a room at the main hotel. When we first arrived we had sometime before we were able to book into our room (3pm is the allowed time). There is a restaurant there but it is buffet and very expensive. I would suggest that if you have some time before you are able to book in to go to the convenience store and buy pre-prepared meals from there. In hindsight it something that we should have done. We had booked a 2 day pass to the main theme park and a half day pass for Disney sea. The wait times for most of the rides at Disney sea were quite long, but as the evening progressed the lines started to thin out. As we only had a few hours in Disney Sea we didn't get to do as much of it as we would have liked. The highlight though was the Indiana Jones ride. We had two days at the main Disneyland park. We managed to get onto all the rides we wanted to. The highlight was the Star Wars ride. It was worth having the two day pass as we got to experience all of the rides we wanted to as we had the time. Also staying at the main hotel allowed us to have a break towards the evening and get some warmer clothes on and then go back to the park. The three days was an awesome experience for our family.    "
1608,4,16-Jun,Malaysia,Family fun,Visites with my kids age 13 and 5Bought a 2 day pass for both the parksRecommended to buy the 3 day pass instead as 1 day in each park is definetly not enough.1 day is good enough for the water parkAs there are more activities on the theme parkAlways get the fast pass to avoid being Dissapointed as it can get real crowded on weekends
1609,5,16-May,India,Awesome for every age,"We took the JR pass and had a direct train to Disney. Once you enter Disney Land, you have maps to guide you to the nearest attractions, I recommend you to take the fast pass quickly as soon as you enter, you don't have to pay extra for it. You can take a fast pass and enjoy smaller rides in the meantime and go to your fast pass attraction on the given time. This way you can cover most of your fast pass attractions in a day.One day is enough to cover Disney land.Lots of eatery, for vegetarian options were cheese pizza ice cream, chocolate rolls and french fries, pop corn, not many but sufficient if you had packed some biscuits along. Food was not allowed but with kids you could bring some.Disney characters are all around- get a chance take pictures. lot of traveler dress into Disney characters, you get to see people with same clothes they come in groups.  carry your Disney outfits mickey bands, goggles. its very common out their.Wear comfortable shoes as you need to walk a lot. Enjoy the magical ride.  If going with small kids, get their height checked, if the height falls in the permissible bracket, they will tie a band on the child's hand, so next time you don't have to check again.Lots and lots of attraction and the best part is its super clean, staff is sooooo polite, always smiling and greeting. hats off to the positive energy they have. We took a 2 day pass, Land and water, enjoyed Land more. Plan accordingly."
1610,4,16-Jul,Indonesia,A fun experience!,"went on a one day trip here, the rides was awesome and the food are great! but compared to Tokyo Hong Kong this ones still are not as fun as the one there"
1611,5,16-Jul,Italy,Go to TokyoDisney after 5PM and on a weekday to beat the crowds and heat,We had a limited time to go to Tokyo Disneyland and Disneysea. We went to Disneyland on a Monday night and decided to go after 5PM. The ticket price was ¬•4200 per person. We did not wait on any rides because all the people went home around the time we came in. We have two small kids and it was nice not to have to wait and since it is summer time it isn't as hot. We were able to walk on almost all the rides the longest wait was 5 minutes. We stayed until the parked closed and the kids loved every minute.
1612,5,16-Jun,United States,First trip to Disney,"We timed our trip to go to the park on Monday hoping that it would not be as crowded.  This paid off.  The park was crowded but we were able to ride all the rides we wanted to ride at least once.  We got to the park 30 min before the gates opened and stayed until 10:00.  We did not have any issues with the language.  Most things were written in Japanese, Chinese and English.  At Disneyland there are fast passes but you can only get one fast pass at a time.  We did not wait more than 1 hour for any rides.  Most took about 30 min standing in line."
1613,5,16-Jul,United Kingdom,Magical,"This was a very different experience visiting the Tokyo Disneyland compared to what I am used to which is Florida and Paris.We had an amazing day and loved every aspect of it except for the food. No junk food in sight which is disappointing for a Disney resort!The rides  and parades and shows etc are all greatThey cancelled the night time fireworks due to extreme weather conditions however the weather was perfect all day and night. This was annoying as the fireworks are usually the highlight of the day. We just spent the night time checking out the merchandise in the shops. The shops seem more expensive to the other Disney parks, however there are lots of great things to buy!I was so happy to find they had the 3D Philharmagic show here, even though the show was in Japanese you could still sing along and enjoy it.The night time electrical parade is particularly goodTokyo Disneyland is everything you expect from Disney. Magical!! Highly recommended"
1614,5,16-Jul,N/A,Magical experience!,"Tokyo Disneyland is truly a magical place! The service provided by every staff there is excellent - whether it is 8am when the park just opened or 10pm. The shows there were simply magnificent. There was a show that was screened on the castle with fireworks and disney music. The experience was truly mesmerising. The wait at the queue was no more than an hour because of the Fast Pass that was available to every guest. It was nice to see the Japanese dressed up in matching clothing, not just as groups of friends but also as families. The Japanese are very polite as well. There is no queue cutting and the park is litter free. It is a far cry from Hong Kong Disneyland."
1615,4,15-Oct,Singapore,Happy place!,"Truly the happiest place on earth! absolutely clean and well maintained. Cna be crowded on weekends and holidays, but still beat HKG's disneyland hands down."
1616,5,16-Jul,N/A,Mrs papel,"We visited Tokyo Disneyland during our second day in Japan. We first visited Tokyo Disney Sea. I have 2 kids(8 and 3 yrs old). This place was a great hit to my children especially to my youngest daughter. They loved also dining in the Queen of hearts restaurant, the food was great and the queu to the resto was not long. We watched almost all the shows...it was all in Japanese but we still enjoyed although it cld have been better if they offered an English version of some shows like in Hongkong Disneyland. The parade of floats both in the afternoon and night were amazing. All the rides for small kids we tried because we used their fast pass whenever it was available...highly recommended to get fast pass tickets so you don't have to queu for a long time. I have been to 3 Disneylands -US,Hongkong and Japan and so far it really is the Happiest place in the World!"
1617,4,16-Jul,United States,Real Magic Kingdom in Tokyo,"People are so serious about Disneyland in Japan. Many guests wore Disney printed T shirts or matching outfit in groups.All the rides were nearly same as ones in the US- very busy and made long line-ups including restaurants. We joined a line for a restaurant around 11AM for lunch and got inside after 12PM.Cafe, Ice cream parlour, diners and restaurants were relatively small, it's hard to find tables and chairs if not seated restaurants.The parades seemed Japan oriented, especially, in this summer, they did Japanese festival like parade that all the characters put on Japanese kimono and danced with Japanese instruments like drams and flutes. That was fun!Souvenir goods & cookies were outrageously fun and many- definitely could find something solely available in Tokyo Disneyland. "
1618,2,16-Apr,Thailand,"Could've improved, especially staff","Firstly, the ticket was less pricey than USJ, but that was the only thing I liked about it. When I went in, at least the people there were not rude, but the amount of people was staggering! When I went on one of the roller coasters, The ratio of letting people in fastpass to normal queue was 1 million:1! Absolutely unacceptable. Please improve on this. Also, since I was a dumb tourist and you had to tell me off in Japanese that this area is reserved for people with disabilities, thank you very much. Staff were not as good as universal studios. Will not visit again. "
1619,5,16-Jul,China,Great place for children and great settings,"New rides added, Monster inc. great maintenance given that it is the first Disneyland in Asia. Very clean and also great safety as the country is very safe in general."
1620,5,16-Jul,Czechia,A magical place in Asia,"Having been to Disneyworld (DW) in Florida many times and Disneyland Paris once, I was of course expecting the same. I was not disappointed and neither were my children and wife who were experiancing a disney park for the first time.Much more compacted than DW and or course this park is divided between disney land and disney sea but the fact it was compact made it so much easier to navigate it all and take advantage of the fast passes without too much walking as you would in the DW.The rides that were there were the same as I remembered although I was disappointed to learn (a few weeks before we went) that space mountain would be closed but still plenty to do. Many new rides as well since my last visit which was DW. Waiting time when we were there (13th July 16) was rediculoiusly short :0 sometimes it stated a 5 min waiting time but we were on the ride in half that time. longest we waited was 30 minutes which for a disney theme park (actually for any large theme park) is amazing.Many rides were ridden twice and we almost didnt need the fast passes but we had 4 in the end which meant we really had more out of the day.The biggest difference I saw was the fact that the japanese really dress up in disney outfits for the visit and this in itsself was great to see.The food as always is overpriced and undersized but no surprise. The soya sauce popcorn tasted only of salt but the caramel one was good and the ice lollies were good for the kids.The shrimp burger in toontown was interesting, the burger itsself very good but the yellow bun was so sweet and I suspect packed with E colourings. The mickey pizza was nice and the perfect size for our 8 yr old.Overall a great day and was a true representation of Disney. The best part for me was the fact that while it was busy, the rides were so quick to get on and this amazed me throughout the day :)No firework display but a great light show."
1621,5,15-Aug,N/A,PARADISE,"I'm a big fans of DISNEY and Disneyland is like super paradise for me! EVERYTHING DISNEY! The shows are perfect, beautiful parade, and I'm speechless!"
1622,5,15-Dec,Vietnam,A paradise for kids and staffs are extremely friendly and helpful,"Overall, it is Disneyland, a place for many stories and dreams.Many fun activities for both adults and children (all ages)The only thing I love about Tokyo Disneyland it is one girl at parking lot, noticed that my daughter's balloon flew away, and she cried. She ran to us, and said she will go to get her a new one, since we still have a mickey mouse badge.We wait for about 15 mins and then 20 mins we thought may be we should leave and she might busy with her duty, but then I think we should wait, what if she need to go pretty far to get the new balloon, and finally she came back with exact balloon got flew away. We offer a token of thanks to her but she didn't take it, big smile and wish us a happy holiday.That's how I love this Disneyland and love Japan."
1623,5,16-Jul,United Kingdom,"Great, even without kids!","My wife and I visited as part of a trip to Tokyo. Despite not having kids with us we had a great day. Obviously, it is geared towards children and families, but we found enough to do to fill a number of hours. Great fun."
1624,4,16-Jul,Taiwan,Good for Kids and Adults,"Tokyo Disneyland isn't as big as LA Disneyland but that is a good thing. My family arrived on Thursday and the rides average wait was 25 min or so. I recommend not going on weekends which you have to squeeze with the locals. The food was the best average here, but overall a different experience."
1625,5,15-Sep,Indonesia,This place is amazing!,"I've been to Disneyland in Anaheim, Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Disney World in Florida. I think Tokyo Disneyland/Disney Sea have extraordinary ways to present Disney in a whole new level. The staff were friendlier than those in Florida. It's very clean and tidy. Definitely a must go if you're visiting Japan.You'll need more than 1 day to visit each park to be able to enjoy all the attractions."
1626,5,16-Jun,Finland,"Beautiful place, great fun for kids","We visited Disneyland with our 11 and 13 years old kids, well aware of the fact that most of the attractions are primarily intended for a bit younger children. If you check the descriptions for the rides, very few do NOT have the tag ""children under 3"". Naturally, these few were our top choices. Our day was a weekday outside top season (early rain season, but a sunny day for us) so the park was not too crowded.We began with Star Tours, queued just 20 minutes (instead of the declared 40) and really enjoyed the ride! Haunted mansion was not that cool, but Pirates of the Caribbean (barely 10 min waiting) quite entertaining. Many Disney rides seem to be just series of well designed and finely detailed imageries that follow each other while you proceed in your car or boat. Splash mountain was this type too, but in spite of the story a it too childish for our audience, the drops were thrilling. Monsters inc. had extra activity with flashlights (30 min queue).Disney has a great system for passing long lines: the fastpass. It took a moment for us to figure out how it works, but once we got the picture, we used fastpass successfully for 3 attractions. Firstly: fastpass is free! Try to beat that, Universal! Once you get your first fastpass, you won't be able to get another until after a certain time. Fastpass gives you a speedy entry to the ride you chose, but only at a given time you can't choose. Popular attractions have their fastpass quota filled quickly so one needs to plan a bit: you may get entry times later than you planned to stay and eventually some fastpasses may be ""sold out"" for the day.The best rides were, in addition to Star Tours, Space mountain, a surprisingly speedy inside roller coaster and Big Thunder Mountain, a real old-fashioned wooden roller coaster. We ended our day around 7 pm with another round of Star Tours, asked for front seats and got them. This time, the show was actually slightly different so if you are a big fan of Star Wars, it may be a good idea to do the Tours twice.All in all we had time for 10 rides&attractions, got no less than excellent service and had a great time. Our lunch was reasonably priced and tasty for theme park standards, no ripoffs here. And we bought the R2D2 popcorn can. What really made it all so pleasant was how beautiful everything was: buildings, gardens, decorations, all so pretty and well taken care of. The iconic Cinderella castle in the middle of the park was the crown jewel of Disney inviting one to take photos from all possible angles.I can recommend Disneyland patricularly to families with small children (under 10 or so). We did fine with a bit older team. Youngsters around 18 looking for extreme rides, fast roller coasters and the like are likely to be disappointed here. Hotheads should consider Universal in Osaka, and be prepared to pay twice the price."
1627,4,15-Sep,N/A,Pretty good,I was here on a buisness trip to tokyo so I decided to go by myself. Everything was in japanese but the jaws ride was fun. There were floods of people and the lines were massive. The food was average but overpriced. Would come again if I ever go to japan again.
1628,5,16-Jun,Indonesia,Wow experience,"This is my 3rd time to a Disney resort, the first after 11 years, and the most magical experience of them all. The dreaded long queues never materialized, this was end of June and probably the sweet spot of low season. Utilizing fastpasses, the longest wait we had was about 35 minutes at Pooh. Even though the weather report was ominous, it only drizzled a few hours in our 3 days there. I would advise anyone who is planning to come to spend some time reading up on online Disney guides and blogs, they have some really useful information. Generally, if you have children below 10,  Disneyland is a much better park compared to Disneysea.We would not hesitate to come back here, it was a wonderful experience "
1629,4,16-May,Singapore,Park flooded with people,"Been here on May 2016, park is full of locals. Q is so long for the ride, Q for more than 3 hours for 1 ride. The staff will gave priority to express ticket holder then to normal ticket holder, strongly recommend to pay a little more for express ticket. Food is expensive than usual, everywhere in this park is full of people and super long Q. I won't back to this park again, I might want to try Sea park. Seems nice, not so crowded."
1630,4,15-Dec,Singapore,Epitome of Disney Magic,"This is definitely in the top 3 magic kingdom style parks (personally, it's number one, but I guess that is slightly subjective). The staff are all fully committed to ensuring you enjoy your visit to the park and are dedicated to their jobs. There is no sight of litter in the parks which enhances the Disney magic... Like the others have mentioned, beware of the crowds, especially on weekends. Would advice you to arrive an hour before opening and rush to get your fast past once the park opens. The park is somewhat similar to the USA magic kingdom style parks though, so if you have visited both and are short on time, visit Disneysea instead. "
1631,5,16-Jul,United States,Disneyland!!!! ,I feel like a little kid again! I dont think this place can ever get old here. Once again you have to come here early so you can beat to rush. Fast Pass Fast Pass ! Park food are all over the place and drinks. Popcorn galore here as well. Flavors to match the theme that your in. 
1632,5,16-Jun,Australia,Excellent Classic Disney experience with Japanese twist.,"A classic Disney experience for everyone, and fun for all. We did this as part of a 3 1/2 day split between DisneySea and Disneyland Tokyo. We took advantage of our 15 minute early pass because we were staying at an official Disneyland hotel. This is an itinerary for anyone interested in maximising their experience in the park. Note that we did this on a weekday and not during a busy period in the middle of the Japan summer. This is by no means a perfect itinerary but something to be considered as a reference point. Space Mountain was not available during our visit so it's not in our plan. First thing we did was the Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blaster (decent) while one person goes to get the fastpass for Pooh's Hunny Hunt (loved it). After the Buzz ride, we joined the standby line for the Monster Inc Ride & Go Seek! (Good) We then did the Star Tours (loved it) (which has different sequence each time but doesn't have a long line - so you can do it repeatedly as appropriate). We then did it's a Small World (decent - No lines) before getting the next Fast Pass for Splash Mountain (loved it). This gives us enough time to use the Fast Pass for Pooh's ride before doing a lunch at the atmospheric Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall (good) We then joined the Haunted Mansion (decent - no lines) getting the next Fast Pass for Thunder Mountain (good) watching the Midday Parade. That leaves us with just enough time to use the Fast Pass for Splash Mountain and then eventually do some shows and fillers before using the Fast Pass for Thunder Mountain. By then you may have only used end up around 2.30 pm to 3.00 pm. You can then do anything you prefer. Pirates of Carribbean (decent - no lines), Country Bear Theatre (good - no lines) and Minnie oh Minne (good - no lines) shows are okay without Japanese. Stich's enchanted tiki room (can miss) should only done with Japanese understanding. After fitting the four we chose to spend a relaxing afternoon walking around, visiting Cinderalla's castle and taking a long break at the Toontown which empties early and having an early dinner and short rides with no waits like Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin and Gadget's Go Coaster there. We then staked out a place for the evening parade. After that we re did Star Tours to try to see whether we can see more sequences and finish with shopping at the World Bazaar. That's what we found to be a good itinerary for our group (3 grown ups, 2 older grandparents and 2 kids aged 9 & 11). Final tip, we purposely visited the park this year while our older kid is 11 because everything costs more after they reached 12. Hope that gives you valuable insight on the park."
1633,5,16-Jul,Indonesia,Heavens for kids.,"I have been to Disneyland many times and all over the place LA, florida, hongkong, tokyo. First time to disney tokyo back to 1987, it was full of fun and never get tired of it. I've just visited Disneyland yesterday and it was raining all day, they always prepare for making sure that no puddle water on the street and preparing all kind of information to aware us about the rain situation. Even they spoke in Japanese but i can understand from the body language. My suggestion get the fast Pass for roller coaster attractions, not the theater or 3d attractions. For 3d and theater maximum waiting 30-60 minutes and for roller coaster like space mountain longer than others."
1634,5,16-Jul,Australia,Disney awesomeness!!,"As all other Magical Kingdom parks, its an amazing day out. Immerse yourself in the magic of Disney and relive your childhood. The Japanese staff are amazing. Visit this park, then DisneySea. Make time to do so, you wont regret it!"
1635,5,16-Jul,Indonesia,Excellent Theme Park,"We visited Tokyo Disneyland on our last summer holiday in July 2016. So far, this disney resort is the perfect size for our young children. Not too big and has many attractions for children under 6.Food are a bit expensive compare to other theme park in Japan. Friendly and helpful staffs. Clean theme park. Buy the magic passport tickets if you want to explore Tokyo disneyland and disney sea. You can visit both theme parks in the same day.Although we visited this park during peak season but we still could have chances to ride most of the attractions."
1636,5,16-Jul,United States,Fun even on a rainy day,We went to Disneyland on a rainy day and thought the crowds would be muted.  It wasn't.  Still a lot of people on a Saturday but there are lots of rides that are indoors so everyone had fun
1637,5,15-Aug,United Kingdom,Clean and Shiny,"The experience was amazing.  the rides all worked, the staff were happy and helpful, the queues were mangeable and it was so clean!"
1638,5,16-Jul,United States,Great Disney experience minus the heat and lines of Orlando,"This year would be the second consecutive visit to Tokyo Disneyland.  My family and I were able to enjoy many rides together, which is hard when you have a 10 year old and a 5 year old.  Many iconic rides were available with a wait of 5-20 minutes.  The longest we waited at a ride was 30.  Get you fast passes for the popular rides.  Another option would be to leave the park around 4-5 and come back before the parade at 7:30.  After the parade, most people seemed to leave around 8:30, which was the best time to go on the rides.  Also, try going  to the popular rides during the parade ( which we saw last year, so we weren't so bummed we missed it).  You have until 10 o'clock to go to the attractions.  Even after 10pm, there seemed to be many people still in the shops.  The food was delicious.  We ate curry and rice, teriyaki beef, and fries at one of the food courts.  You don't need to buy water in Japan because most places offer free water.  Cold Mickey Popsicles and ice cream was available for about 350 yen (about $3.50 US dollars, a little less).  The cute character buckets were all the craze!  My daughter took home Olaf with salted popcorn and my son found R2D2 with butter and soy sauce  flavored popcorn (sounds gross, but it tastes like eating hurricane popcorn).  I wanted Dumbo, but that would've been excessive.  Fans that served as a mist sprayer were available around the park, thankfully, since it was almost 90 degrees the day we went.  Although most Cast members spoke minimal English, my family and I were able to understand the gist of what they were saying.  I wouldn't recommend going to the Stich attraction since it was interactive and in full Japanese. The shows are also in Japanese, which was why we didn't see many.  The last trip on the monorail was 11:55pm, which allows time for you to eat at Ikspiari."
1639,5,16-Apr,N/A,Great for Families with Babies,We visited Disney with our 10 month old baby and it was perfect! We rented a stroller and when we rode some rides we were able to park our stroller and no one touched it. It's a safe place. I liked that there was a nursing room. There are a lot of baby safe rides. She really enjoyed the small world ride and the parades. I would definitely come back here! 
1640,5,16-Jul,Australia,Magical,Very similar to Disneyland in California with Japanese flare and organization and politeness. The staff are so helpful polite and everything is so clean compared to CA.Otherwise very similar.the food reasonably priced for an adavture park. They allow you to bring your own picnic food. The night show on the cable was fantastic. Fire work is not as good as CA. Use fast pass. If you stay in the two Disneyland hotels ( Tokyo Disney land hotel or Tokyo Disney sea Miracosta hotel) or the ambassador hotel you get 15 min magic time. That is 15 min earlier entry to the park..Miracosta is right in the Disney sea park the Disney land hotel is across from the Disney land entry. Disney land hotel looks magical. Ambassador hotel is easily connected to both parks via monorail.the access to Disney land hotel is second to non.
1641,5,16-Jun,United Kingdom,Another great park,"We have now done all 5 Disney Parks in the world (L.A, Florida x9, Paris x2, Hong Kong and Tokyo) although I know Shanghai is opening. We only had one day and so decided to go to Disneysea first. But by mid afternoon we had done all the rides and attractions we wanted and on some occasions twice. We decided, as we were only here once, to pay again and go to Disneyland next door. Yes it cost us 29,600 Yen (¬£202) but who cares?Disneyland Park was excellent, like all Disneyland parks. It has some of the classic rides we love like Star Tours, Pirates of the Caribbean, Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger Spin, Thunder Mountain, Haunted Mansion and Splash Mountain. We liked Disneysea but found this park larger, a bit quieter and more spacious. It also had better restaurants and we loved the different popcorn; must have the caramel and milk chocolate popcorn!They offer a 6pm ticket which isn't quite half price but a lot less and at 6pm droves of people came into the park for the night time fireworks, parades and rides. We found wait times pretty good with most things under an hour. Our all time favourite is Magic Kingdom, Florida but this is a good park."
1642,5,16-Jun,Australia,"Great fun, went back for a second day",Visiting with our kids and grand kids and had two great days.  Plenty for all to do and language not really an issue.
1643,5,16-Jul,Australia,DISNEYLAND!!! ,Well what can I say - it's Disneyland! If you don't like Disneyland you're probably dead or crazy. We arrived early and obtained fast passes as often as one can - however we found sometimes the waiting times indicated on some rides were not as long in reality. So it's good to have them anyway just in case !!! All the rides were awesome -- I personally recommend Pooh's Hunny Hunt and Pirates of the Caribbean. 
1644,4,16-Jul,Australia,The happiest place on earth,"Visited Tokyo Disneyland. This was my fourth time.I have to remind myself of the wonder and awe I had the very first time as I don't want to take 'the happiest place on earth' for granted.On arrival we went straight for a fast pass to some of the attractions. We started in Westernland and got a fast pass for Big Thunder Mountain. Fast pass allows you to fast track entrance to a ride at a certain time (within an hour of that time). So in the meantime we went on Pirates of the Caribbean. The rides are long and visually strong. I wonder at the work that goes into the detail, it's amazing. We also had time to go on the Western River Railroad. Food and drink stalls are varied, plentiful and range in prices. We bought some well earned drinks. Given it was summer, hot and highly humid, there are pockets that amplify this. Especially given the paving everywhere. Hydration especially with such drinks as Aquarius, Pocari Sweat and Match are a must as are comfortable walking shoes, hats, sunscreen and sunglasses.The day continued with rides such as Splash Mountain (with the mandatory photo), It's a Small World (with that tune continually repeated while you identify all the countries the ride shows off), Haunted Mansion, Roger Rabbits Car Toon Spin, Gadgets Go Coaster, Star Tours (with 3D glasses, be careful if you get vertigo easily!), Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters to name a few. We strolled through Adventureland, Critter Country, Fantastyland, Toontown, Tommorrowland, and the World Bazaar.We found space to watch parades and shows such as the Tanabata Greeting, the Nighttime Parade (which goes for at least 30 minutes) and Sky High Wishes (if you are there late).We ate at Cafe Orleans and the Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall. The food, service and air conditioned comfort (which occurs on many rides was welcome).The Disney characters greetings at the main entrance were available (if you don't mind waiting) and throughout the park. I had chance to cuddle Baloo the Bear and see many others throughout the day. Over time I used to celebrate the fact the Tokyo Disneyland had not folded to the pressure of many attractions by not keeping prices down having captive audiences but over the last four years their gifts and souvenirs and to a smaller extent their food have taken price hikes which is a shame!Finally I went with two Princesses who felt right at home!"
1645,5,16-Jun,China,Great place for a kiddie holiday,"Every little detail is taken care of. Waiting times can be long for some rides / photo sessions, but an off-peak visit [end June] might be a smart way to travel. Lots of shows and rides [older kids will enjoy more] but our 2-year-old had lots of fun chasing her favourite Disney characters"
1646,5,16-Jul,China,Had a great time!,"Im not really a theme park buff, but this one really needs mentioning! While its true that there will be a lot of people, the staff make a lot of effort to keep everyone happy as well as the park clean. Rides are always smooth sailing and the queues are moving. You dont ever feel stuck like some of the other theme parks. The staff are alsways smiling and ready to lend a helping hand. Knowing how polite and well mannered Japanese are, the staff go above and beyond to keep that enthusiasm the whole time. We spent a good deal of the day roaming about the many parts of the park, catching a lot of pictures as well as a couple of shows. The characters in their costumes brings me back to my younger years! We came from Shinjuku station, thus, youll need to follow clear directions to get onto the correct train line. We made a huge mistake on the way back and ended up buying a wrong ticket which was allowed on another train line, thankfully the station official was kind enough to refund the wrongly bought tickets. Have a good rest the day before and bring loads of water as well as a good pair of shoes!"
1647,4,16-Jun,India,"Nice experience, but the rush on Weekends is mind-boggling","Nice set-up and really exciting for the kids. The number of rides, their arrangements, and the variety of activities were also exhilarating for adults."
1648,5,16-Jan,Qatar,Amazing - a must see!!!,"My niece and I enjoyed the tour of the whole place, and it truly makes one believe in a magical kingdom. We saw all the parades and each one is impressive. Despite the winter temperature I felt the warmth and hospitality of the people who works there. everywhere you go there is always someone willing to assist - that's great."
1649,4,16-Jun,Australia,A great day out for the kids,"We caught the train from Tokyo Station to Miahama, 6 stops and less than 20mins. People really dressed up for the park which was amusing in itself. The staff were friendly and engaging. Just as Disneyland Orlando, the grounds are immaculate and the atmosphere is set by music throughout park. Our daughter loved it. Though there are shady parts it is open and on concrete so heat's an issue in the summer - bring healthy snacks (food was substandard and expensive) sunblock, hats, and patience as you wait for rides up to 50mins. Some attractions are only in Japanese (Stitch Encounter) and once in you're trapped till it's over. Intersperse the rides with seeing indoor attractions (Cpt Jack Sparrow or Haunted Castle) to keep cool and get off your feet. "
1650,4,16-Apr,Japan,Had a wonderful time with my family,"My American husband had never liked Disneyland because there are always so many people especially in Tokyo Disneyland.  You always have to wait and wait.  However he and our 2 grown up children enjoyed it very much this time.  Because of my sister's family.  They know the Disneyland so well.  They got tickets and they got some first passes, and took us to some attractions with no lines.  My 79 year old mother came with us this time.  She has difficulty walking. We rented a wheelchair.  We also could park our car close to the gate because of her.  All the staffs are very kind with  big smile, not fake ones.   I love Disneyland especially their hospitalities."
1651,4,16-Jun,Indonesia,Nice experience,"Nice weather when we visited the park, quite crowded because it was Sunday. Maybe better not to visit it on the weekend. Nevertheless, still acceptable. We have to queue within reasonable time. Kids love it, and we also enjoy the park very much :)"
1652,5,16-Jul,Japan,The greatest place on earth!,"It was everything, what you would expect from Disneyland.  You must expect long lines and expensive prices for everything, it's still a great place to spend the day with the family!"
1653,5,16-Jun,United States,LOVED IT!,"We live in California have been to Disneyland in Anaheim countless times.  We have also been to Orlando Disney.  I was a little worried about going to Tokyo Disney thinking that I would be disappointed comparing it to Disney in the United States, but my husband and I had a wonderful time!  The language barrier was not a problem at all as I feared it would be.  I was actually surprised by how much was in English, and it made me wonder how the Japanese felt about that.  It was the least crowded Disneyland that I have ever been to with most rides only having a five to fifteen minute wait.  We were there on a Wednesday in June. The longest we waited was 60 minutes for Splash Mountain (we should have thought ahead and got a fast pass).  Space Mountain was closed for construction, which was fine, and they are currently building Indiana Jones, but most rides were up and running, although they didn't have some rides at all like the Matterhorn.  We thought the Jungle Cruise and the TIkki Room were better than California.  I loved walking through the Swiss Family Robinson Tree House which was changed to Tarzan's house in our Disneyland years ago. I agree with one reviewer that said it would be nice if they had more souvenirs that said Tokyo Disney on them.  I found a few things to bring back but there weren't a lot of choices.   After being in Asia for three weeks, we were hoping to have a good old Disney hamburger, but, unfortunately, we could only find a 'Mickey meat and cheese sandwich,"" which is their ""version"" of a hamburger.  Of course, I realize we are in a foreign country and should not expect American food, but I really wasn't sure what to expect at an American theme park in Japan.  I also have to say that the crowds of people were the most well-behaved I have ever experienced.  The Japanese people and their children were so impressive with their patience in waiting in line and walking though the park.  I'm afraid that, from now on, I will be comparing our Disneyland to Japan!"
1654,5,16-Jul,N/A,Disney ,"When we went it was not crowded, so we were able to get on all the rides fairly quickly(for Disney)  Wish more souvenirs made note that they were from Toyko Disney, not just generic Disney merchandise."
1655,5,16-Jun,Australia,Great Disney experience,"This was actually my first time to Disneyland anywhere in the world but it was exactly as I was expecting, had all the classic rides/attractions you would expect. The Star Wars and Space Mountain rides were the best fun, although be warned that all the seats in the rides are a little smaller than western parks, we almost did not fit in a few."
1656,5,16-Jun,N/A,A very fun and well run Disney park,"I'd only been to Disneyland and Disney World so I wasn't sure what to expect here. What I found was a very clean, well maintained and smoothly running Disney theme park. Many of the rides are comparable to ones at DL and DW, but they seem updated at least, while others seem very different (e.g., Pirates of the Caribbean has only one drop, while the Pooh ride is a completely different - and for me more fun - version). There is a wide variety of food and I'd recommend grazing throughout the day to sample the variety. Food lines can get long at some times, keep in mind. Ride lines can get super long, too. If you're staying at a Disney hotel and get the Happy 15 early entry it's quite useful even though it's only 15 minutes early into the park and not directly onto the rides."
1657,3,16-Jun,N/A,Fun fun fun with lots of merchandise,Enjoy the day taking photos for adult. Kids go crazy over the rides. Love the shops and coin machine is a must do activity for me on every disney visit. I feel that this place is Still ahead of hongkong disney and france disney 
1658,5,16-Apr,Australia,Disney Tokyo Adventure!!!,"The Japanese people dress up in theme. The eateries & souvenirs are very good, but can be expensive. Best to get a fast pass as it cuts down on wait time.  Felt safe and the staff were fantastic. Would visit again."
1659,5,16-Jun,Malaysia,A happy place for our kids,We enjoyed ourselves so much at Tokyo Disneyland. Memories we had here as a family would be cherished for a lifetime.
1660,5,16-Jun,Australia,Happiest place on Earth! ,"Clean, organised and fun! The day ran like clockwork. Fast Pass system is a must! We were able to go on all of the super popular rides with minimal lining up. A very big day for small children; however, the various rides, shows, sights, parades and food stall vendors were enough to keep them 'moving through the day'. A perfect Disney experience for all of us. "
1661,5,16-Jun,United States,Perfect Day at Tokyo Disneyland!,"After going to DisneySea on a rainy day, we go to Disneyland the following day and the weather is perfect. Tokyo Disneyland was the first Disney park to be built outside the United States, and it opened on 15 April 1983. Tokyo Disneyland is owned by The Oriental Land Company, which licenses the theme from The Walt Disney Company. Tokyo Disneyland and its companion park, Tokyo DisneySea, are the only Disney parks not wholly or partly owned by the Walt Disney Company. I bought tickets ahead of time online, so all I had to do was print them out and go straight to the entrance gate. We arrive Tokyo Disneyland an hour early, and there's already long lines forming at every entrance gate.There many cast members holding signs an hour before opening to please walk, and not run. But so many people still run! After we get our Fast Passes to Monsters Inc, our first ride is Space Mountian, and there's only a 5 minute wait! After Space Mountin, we go on Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters. We walk across and go on Thunder Mountain. We walk by Snow White's Adventures and since the line was short, we hop on! We use our Fast Passes to go on Monsters Inc. and walk to the front of the line. Then, we go to the Haunted Mansion - only a 5 minute wait! We go to Peter Pan's Flight, and the wait is 30 minutes, which is the longest wait we had. Next up, It's a Small World! Then, we ride Pinnochio's Daring Journey. We then go to one of our classic favorite rides - Pirates of the Caribbean! We decide to go on the Jungle Cruise since it was a short wait. Tokyo Disney is known to have unique snacks. We try the popular Tipo Tortas! They are pastries shaped like churros, and filled with either chocolate, or caramel and custard.So we got to ride 11 attractions all before 2pm! We were so happy to be able to ride all the attractions we wanted to see."
1662,5,16-May,United States,Disney Fanatic,"Being from the US I am a frequent visitor to WDW Florida and DL California. I wasn't sure how Tokyo Disneyland would compare. I was not disappointed at all in my visit. Although it was not ""home"" as I like to call WDW, it was fabulous and unique. They have done an awesome job keeping the Disney feeling alive in Tokyo!"
1663,5,16-Jun,Romania,Great time in Tokyo!!!!,"First time in a Disney Resort. And yes we are Europeans and we wnet first in Tokyo and not in ParisüòÑ It is definetly mich more reearding and full as an experience to do it in Asia because you do see people embracong the full disney Experience like nowhere else in the world! From groupa of boys and girls in head tomyoe matching outfits, to families, to giggels etc. Recommended!"
1664,2,16-Jun,United States,If you have a Fastpass you are treated like the Emperor. If not you are a beggar,"Compared to Anaheim, the walk ways are at least double the width of Anaheim. This lessens the congestion. A lot of the waiting areas are shaded. My wife and daughter are vegetarians and many restaurants had no vegetarian options.The two restaurants that do have vegetarian options are more expensive and require a reservation.Many rides are the same and some are improvedTheir Fastpass policy seems to let in5 people from the standby line for every 100 from the fast pass line. Even after they have depleted the Fastpass line, they would rather put a few stragglers in than let a few more from the stand by line. It really soured the whole experience.Disney Sea is a much better park.If you can go to only one I suggest you choose Disney Sea"
1665,3,16-Jun,Australia,"Great atmosphere, not enough food vendors/restaurants","Use your fast passes! Without them, you will be waiting, waiting, waiting. There are not enough eating areas considering the number of visitors and there are wait lists to use the restaurants. As such, we visited in low season, we would not have handled the peak season, especially with children.The rides are longer than at other theme parks and once a child is 102cm, they can ride on most attractions. The shopping area has a great energy and we enjoyed seeing families walking around in their matching Disney t-shirts."
1666,3,15-Sep,Australia,Worth a visit,"Disneyland as we all know is about long long lines. This is unavoidable. Despite this we still had a great time. The star wars ride was a secret winner. There was a never a line, it was actually a lot of fun, and it allowed us to rest our tired feet for a little while lol. Be prepared to be confused in a lot of the ones aimed at younger kids, because obviously all the characters are speaking japanese lol still alot of fun though. Be warned, we were stopped at the entrance gate and asked to cover up our tattoos so they ""didn't frighten the children"". It was a 35 degree day, and knowing that Japan is culturally not very ok with tattoos so we had made an effort to cover as much as possible but Disnelyland is very cautious. We were allowed through without further issue from staff once they inspected out tattoos to be sure nothing gang related/offensive. So just be prepared that this will potentially happen, and dont get too upset about it."
1667,4,16-Jun,India,Good place to spend a day.,"It was fun for my 10 year old.Was there today.Pirates of the Carreabean was a good ride.The haunted castle with 999 ghost ""dying""to meet you was a good one too.Waiting lines are frustrating but the crowd  is so much there is no other way out even with Fast pass.We spend 2 days.Took a 3 day passport.One day at disney sea.2days at Disney land.Overall Fun experience.On saturday evening Cindrellas castle came alive and the show was great.The lighted parade was awesome."
1668,5,16-Jun,Singapore,Fun for Family,"We had been to Hong Kong DisneyLand, and comparing to Tokyo Disney Land.  My family will sure be back to Tokyo DisneyLand.The only down side is some of the screen plays are in Japanese, and leaving foreign wondering what is going on.  Nevertheless the rides are fun, even for my younger son of 5."
1669,5,16-Jun,Australia,Magic,"I am 55 years young and loved it. Must admit I had been to LA Disneyland a few times, but last time in 1981. The reason for this visit was because my wife wanted to go. but being a kid at heart loved every moment. Went on a Wednesday, bought tickets online and walked straight in - and then what to do first? It was not too busy and did not wait overly long in queues. Actually timed the queues against what the signs said. We were always quicker than the posted anticipated time. Food wise it was not expensive. Must admit half the fun of this place is seeing all the visitors dressed up. The fast ride tickets are a good idea which you are entitled to one every couple  of hours. however, we only used it once as the queues were not at all long. Easy walk from the train station. If you're going to Tokyo - go to Disneyland"
1670,5,16-Jun,United States,Our favorite disney park!,"LOVED this park!  This one has all the classic rides you know and love if you have ever been to the Disney park in Orlando- including Small World and Space Mountain.  We enjoyed these rides and everything about the park.  One thing unique to this place is the different flavored popcorn in every land- from ""soy sauce and butter"" (our least favorite) to black pepper (actually very yummy) and white chocolate.  It's a lot of fun to go to each land and try each flavor.  They also sell different shaped popcorn holders- Mr. Potato Head, R2D2, and Pooh.  We enjoyed seeing everyone carrying them around. This is a great park!  The restrooms were clean and the dining facilities offered a great variety of foods.  "
1671,5,16-Jun,N/A,Beautiful and magical,"My partner and I really enjoyed our day at Disneyland. He had never been to Disneyland anywhere before and he loved it. I found it better than Disney in Florida.It is definitely the quieter park out of the two. We lined up 30 mins before the park opened and were no where near the front. We managed to get everything we wanted to get done plus more, but we were lucky it was a quiet day with our longest wait being 20 mins. Planning is key here. Do your research on the attractions you want to see most and the popular ones. Make use of the fast pass tickets. Get a fast pass for one ride and head towards the next ride. We got a fast pass for monsters inc then went on poohs honey hunt while waiting for fast pass time. If your lucky to have wifi there's an app that tells you waiting times for the attractions without going to the attraction to find out and helps with planning what to do next.We enjoyed the food and didn't find it too expensive as what I was expecting. The park is beautiful, magical and clean and doesn't show its age at all. They look after it extremely well. We will definitely be back."
1672,5,16-Apr,United States,Check off the bucket list!,"It is my goal to visit every Disneyland in the world (now including Shanghai) and I visited Disneyland Tokyo for my 20th birthday. I have been to Disneyland in Anaheim, Disney World, and Disneyland Paris and this castle is by far the most beautiful. Workers are friendly, rides are great, streets are clean. I'm a sucker for churros, and I must say that their churros are completely different... Took one bite and threw the rest away. We went two nights in a row and unfortunately they cancelled the fireworks show due to weather but the show on the castle with projections are not to be missed!!"
1673,5,16-May,Australia,Kids young and old will love it!,"Ok, so I'm not young - but Disneyland just brings back your inner child!  I had a wonderful day.  We were there on a Saturday, so it was ridiculously busy, but we happily strolled through the crowds, taking in all the magic, colour and excitement.The parade was amazing!  I can't compliment the performers enough for the way they kept character, smiled, waved, and generally looked like they were having the time of their lives.  We were lucky to see two parades, as there was also an Easter one (have a funny bunny holiday!), which was also brilliant.  It was lovely to hear all the cute Japanese children exclaiming their excitement as their favourite characters went past.Food is expensive - which is typical of all major tourist places, but you can always bring your own snacks.  Never go anywhere without a water bottle!  There are popcorn stands with some crazy flavours - soy sauce and butter, curry...??  Might be popular in Japan, but strange for Australians lol.The different ""Lands"" were great - characters in costume roamed around, happily posing for photos with visitors.  We saw two shows on stage - again, the performers were faultless.Lines for some of the rides were incredibly long (well, it was Saturday) - we only went on two rides, one of which we had to wait for an hour to get on.  You can always head to the rides early and use your entry ticket to get a time allocation for later in the day.Merchandise galore for happy memories - plenty for the kids (young and old).I can now say, ""Been there, done that"" - I won't visit another Disneyland, but I'm so glad I've been to one.  Tick that off the bucket list!"
1674,5,15-Jul,Indonesia,Family Fun Time,"Visit Tokyo Disney Sea with family, all of us had a super fun time there. Park is big, many rides, so much souvenirs and collectible items, many entertainment good food. Definitely will come back...."
1675,5,16-Feb,N/A,Happiest place in the world for a reason,"Compared to Universal Studios, lines were a lot shorter and a lot more rides are open. Absolutely loved it. A lot of souvenirs to be bought of excellent quality! There was so much variety and something for everyone that it was actually overwhelming to shop at. Definitely won't be able to do the whole park in one day, go for the two days of you can! Shows are not to be missed!Definitely not overhyped at all!3x 20 yo males, 1x 20 yo female "
1676,5,15-Jul,N/A,"Extremely fun, bigger than HK Disneyland","Went with my hubby and sister. My sister had planned to simply tag along and skip all the rides due to her motion sickness prob. I encouraged her to take her motion sickness pill half an hour before reaching Disneyland. :) We had bought the Disneyland tickets online in advance in SG so when we arrived, we merely showed the printed slips that we had brought. Do book your tickets online as the entrance queue was very long even for us who did not need to buy the tickets there. Once in Tokyo Disneyland, get your first fastpass attraction. Take note that after you have gotten the first fastpass, the timeslot of the next fastpass that you can take is printed on that fastpass that you are holding on to. Remember to return to the fastpass attraction within the timeslot stated on the fastpass ticket too, else you will have wasted all your time. (So there are two timeslots on the fastpass ticket that you have to be sure of). After getting our first fastpass ticket, we went to sit for the simulator ride, Star Wars: The Adventures Continue. You should have a good back to take this ride as it shakes too much. Or, I advise you to stretch your legs all the way, rest the soles of your feet on the front metal in front of you, kind of like applying pressure to stabilise your sitting position when the ride shakes left right front back! This tip is what I gave my sis as she is shorter and could not place her feet on the ground when seated on the high seat. No problem for taller ones though.Amazingly, I managed to get my sis to take all the rides except one. My hubby and I had thought that Big Thunder Mountain (Fastpass Attraction) was the scariest rides of all so we told sis to skip it. Turned out the ride was manageable with a lot of wind in our faces. :) The scariest ride of all was Space Mountain (Fastpass attraction)! I almost wished for the ride to stop asap! It just went on and on for too long. Tears were brimming in my eyes (and I'm actually a thrill seeker and loves to go on roller coaster rides) and my heart was in my throat!! Came down from the ride wiping my tears! Poor sis got a big scare but after some ten minutes or so, we did say it was ultra fun! üëçThe Grand Circuit Raceway runs the car on designated track lines so we thought that it wouldn't be fun like Bumper cars and Go Kart. We were wrong, again! It was rather fast and fun! There was a ride (could be 'Monsters Inc ride n seek!') which was really special as the seats could rotate even all the way upwards, meaning you lie flat on your back to face the ceiling deco and stuff. Isn't that cool? You must also go queue for Country Bear Theatre! Even though it is only played in Japanese, one does not need to know the language to appreciate the beauty of the stage performance. I particularly liked it that the bears were not limited to their appearance on the stage itself. My advice is not to sit too front in the theatre. You would miss all the happenings in the centre of the theatre (special mention of the right wall and the ceiling!) The Haunted House was a little scary as it was kind of life-like! The Lucky Nuggets Cafe sells very affordable meals! After a filling lunch, we took Western River Railroad as we didn't want to puke on the thrill rides. I bought a blue folded card holder secured with a button that also comes with a wristlet strap and a keychain ring. The cover is 3D reflective. Extremely beautiful! HK Disneyland does not sell this. I should have gotten at least a second one as all my friends love it too! At one of those cafes, there was this character egg (shaped like an egg, with different Disney characters as the face of the egg) that contains a packet of M&Ms chocs. I was told that they were seasonal collectibles and that different cafes sell different character eggs! It is a nice and memorable collectible! Will definitely revisit Tokyo Disneyland! "
1677,2,16-Mar,United States,Not Worth,"To preface this review, I‚Äôve been to both Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California. In fact, my family goes to Disney World every few years so I might be a bit biased when it comes to visiting another Disneyland‚Äôs. But because I have experience with the other Disney‚Äôs, I feel like I couldn‚Äôt like Disneyland. It‚Äôs really small ‚Äì too small ‚Äì with too much people visiting. Granted we also went during one of their busier weeks but it felt so suffocating! We entered the park at 8:30am, after queuing up since 7:30am. By the time I made it to the Monsters Inc. Ride for a FastPass, they were already giving out passes for a 2pm return and the standby wait time was 180 minutes. Keep in mind the park opens at 8:00am. Insane! There were waits EVERYWHERE. Waits for rides. Waits to pay. Waits to buy popcorn. Waits to buy popsicles. Waits to see characters. Waits for the parades. Waits for literally EVERYTHING. And this is coming from a person that willingly waited 2.5 hours for the new Harry Potter ride in the middle of August in Florida heat. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore! We only ended up going on about 4-5 rides that day, which was a huge bummer. I literally waited 45 minutes just to get soy sauce popcorn. If I could turn back time and re-do this trip, I would‚Äôve cut out Tokyo Disneyland and just went to DisneySea instead."
1678,5,16-Jun,Philippines,Love it!,"Oh I love Tokyo Disneyland. Though it's raining during our visit we still enjoyed it.  Raincoats and umbrella were sold at the stores.  Since it's raining during our visit, theres no waiting time for the rides, we were accommodated right away, good thing at tdl is that rides are still operational though it's raining."
1679,5,16-Jun,United States,Disney,Seemed smaller than the US Disney but made it easier to get around. Opened at 9:00 am so we arrived about 8:30. We went mid June and lines were not that long.  Mostly 15-30 minute wait....the ones that were longer we used our Fast Passes.  Tried almost all the Popcorn there...curry was our favorite!
1680,5,16-Jun,United States,Cheaper Than Anaheim/Shorter Lines,"My fam & I intend to visit Tokyo Disney again. Fantastic experience. Cheaper than Anaheim & lines are much shorter. Great Fast Pass system. Oddly, Star Tours lines were less than 10 mins; Monsters Inc was 45 (not worth it). LOVED their updated Winnie the Pooh. Go during parade to avoid long lines. üòâüëç"
1681,5,16-May,United Kingdom,Great day out,The whole day was just great. There were queues for the rides but not too bad. All the children had a really good time. So did the adults. We spent a long day and were never bored. The staff were brilliant
1682,5,16-May,Philippines,Always a happy day,"Every time we visit Tokyo DisneyLand, it sure is a happy day. It will be ""happier"" if you visit on a weekday. The last time we visited was with our little kids. Here are some attractions we did with our 3yr old and 1yr old: Jungle Cruise: Wildlife Expeditions, The Enchanted Tiki Room, Alice's Tea Party, It's a Small World, Haunted Mansion, Mickey's PhilharMagic, Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters, and most importantly, the Parades."
1683,3,16-Jun,N/A,Childhood dream,It's everyone's childhood dream to go to Disneyland. Some of us just leave it a bit later in life. Generally I think it was good. It makes me realise though our best theme parks on the Gold Coast are superior and world class. One of my favourite childhood books was Dumbo so I had to do the ride. I enjoyed the Peter Pan ride the most.  Very authentic characters. Again like Universal Studios some English subtitles would help.
1684,5,16-Jun,United States,Wonderful!,"We used to have the Annual Disneyland pass in Anaheim, CA and went to the park every week with our kids when it wasn't crowed. Coming here surprised me.  While it is similar, I am liking it more! For some reason, it is nicer and cleaner. People are orderly, polite, respectful, and clean.  The restrooms are always clean! The Winnie the Poo ride in so lame in Anaheim, but the one here is so awesome! We love it so much we went on it twice. The wait as you get into the building is lovely, with pages of the book with amazing artwork on display as you stand in line. The ride itself is wonderful! Everyone needs to see it at least once. "
1685,4,16-Jan,Australia,"So much fun, Really bad food","So much fun, but you must understand the fast pass system before you start your day to save you time in lines! The food is woeful , take your own if you care about healthy life choices- its all fast food and deep fried."
1686,5,16-Jun,Singapore,Haapyness is here ! ,"my son and I visited disneyland tokyo. Having only been to the HK one in the paat I feel this park is way bigger and the rides are better. But the atmosphere is pure joy. The japanese are organised and polite and are really into the disney theme. Many of them dress up and take the theme very seriously. We enjoyed people watching - seeing the many young ""disney princesses"" school kids in school uniforms sporting Mickey and Minnie ears and adults in their sunday best with matching Micket tahirts and ears! I guess the happyness is realy infectious and soon you will be humming populat disney tunes when you hear them played throughout the park. As in Japan, food in the park is of high standard and everything - even the popcorn is great! Highly recommend trying all the flavours! Get one of the popcorn buckets in a disney character - we got R2-D2 and top up the flavours as you eat your way through! IMHO Milk Chocolate is the best! Ride queus are average 30 mins on a weekday but dont be put off - there are things to see whilst waiting - splash mountain / space mountain / big thunder mountain for the thrills - tea cups / dumbo / carousel for the kid in you - something for everyone! Atmosphere is really infectious! Staff are helpful and kind and if they are unable to assist you due to language barrier they will approach another who will be able to help! Stay for rhe night show and experience disney at night for a different perspective! Just go and experience the magic! "
1687,4,15-Jul,United Kingdom,Use FastPass to beat the queues,"We got to see Berlioz, Chip 'n' Dale, Daisy Duck, Jiminy Cricket and Miss Bianca soon after entering. Use FastPass whenever you can to save time from queuing for long periods. If it's hot, make sure you go on Splash Mountain.The food in the restaurants is superb and delicious - complete opposite of Disneyland Paris. The stalls have a large variety of food and snacks including many different flavours of popcorn and the staff are really friendly and helpful."
1688,3,16-Jun,United Kingdom,7 service guidelines???,"Despite having previously worked for Disney myself this was the first time I have ever actually gone to an attraction as a guest so maybe my expectations are a little high. But I am surprised at the number of staff who had no English and generally just didn't follow the standard service guidelines that every staff member should know and follow. Some were outright rude. Also this isn't necessarily the staffs fault but do people really just sit in the middle of a busy walkway on a mat?? Surely not safe üòÇ however despite this overall it was a good experience, I would recommend arriving as early as possible especially on weekends as it was very busy... More so than I expected. It's not too bad price wise and I got my picture with Micky so can't complain too much!! "
1689,5,16-Jun,United States,Similar to American Disneyland but smaller,"What can I say, Disneyland is always fun and the kids loved it. Unfortunately it was rainy and cold the day we visited, but the crowds still lined up. Tokyo Disneyland is super crowded no matter what the crowd calendar predicts. All the attractions can be found at Anaheim Disneyland, but the Japanese hospitality was the best. Also, with the current exchange rate, TokyoDisney was way more reasonable. The food was decently priced. We ate at the Alice in Wonderland restaurant and the food presentation was so cute. Plus it was comfortable and had air conditioning. One unique aspect was the many flavors of popcorn they sell. All the Japanese kids have re-full able character shaped popcorn containers with shoulder straps, which were so cute. My kids enjoyed the milk chocolate and caramel flavors best. They also had soy sauce flavor. I don't think Disneyland is a must see, would rather go next door to Disney Sea, which is fabulous (see my review). However, it's worth a visit if you love Disney and don't mind a lot of similar rides."
1690,5,16-Feb,United States,Amazing Disney location,"This is a great Disney experience, along with DisneySea nearby.  This is clean, beautiful and the attractions are top notch.  Definitely a must-see if you're into Disney."
1691,5,16-Jun,Indonesia,Family fun üòÉ,"Tokyo disneyland is one of the best way to have fun with your family while in tokyo.This theme park has so may great rides, shops, and restaurants.Rides that you must try : big thunder mountain, haunted mansion, star tours, space mountain (be sure to take fast pass to avoid long queue)Food that you must try : great waffle companyAnd like any other disneyland the parade and the night show is so spectacular and heartwarming.. "
1692,5,16-May,N/A,Perfect for kids but we also had fun as a couple ,Everything is well organised at this place.It could be any child's dream but we also had fun as two adults. Yet the rides are more suitable for kids except a few and there is no alcohol at this resort. We heard that Disney see is more suitable for adults but we didn't have one more day to try it.Tip: you can skip the long lines by Fast Pass tickets which is free but you should manage your time for the ride in advance.
1693,4,16-Jun,India,Disney is Disney!,"This is the 4th Disneyland I've been to, and was very weary of the crowds after reading about how crazy it gets. We didn't go 30 - 45 minutes before opening as recommended but around 10ish, and getting into the parks was a breeze. We were there on a Wednesday and Thursday, and made use of the fastpass system and were able to do all the rides we wanted, even multiple times! So it wasn't all as bad as I anticipated. Also, people here are very polite and queue very patiently. I would go again!"
1694,5,16-May,United States,The happiest place on earth,"Who can say no to Disney? If you ever been to Disneyland or Magic Kingdom, this is just another one replica of it. But it is the very first Disney outside the US. And it is still the happiest place on earth whether you are young or old, it still put a smile on your face. Just remember .... there are so many merchandises that you want to take home with you :)"
1695,4,16-May,N/A,The Magic Never Dies!,"Went there on a Thursday. We thought it would not be so crowded since the Spring Vacation and golden week just ended. been looking for a place to eat inside. I thought of Blue Bayou, to my disappointment. it is for reservation basis. Tip: Check their website first to know which restaurants require reservation before visiting Disney. Overall, I still enjoy it even though that it is a bit crowded."
1696,4,16-Jun,Singapore,Still good,"Similar to other Disneylands we have visited (Anaheim, HK). A bit older than the HK one, so some of the attractions look dated. Disney Sea is more interesting with newer more thrilling rides and more spectacular night show."
1697,5,15-Jul,Thailand,Dream come true,"I spend all day in this park. The most rides is for kid. The merchandise is so cute if I have unlimited money, I will buy all of it. I love ""Once Upon a Time"" show, it is very amazing. But I miss ""Sky High Wishes"" show because it is windy. So I will come back for sure!!!"
1698,5,16-Jan,Indonesia,satisfied,There are so many variations of game. For adults and for children. The parade is also wonderful. We experience some snow in disneyland.
1699,4,16-Jun,United Arab Emirates,Disneyland tokyo,Great fun .. great specially for family with young kids and teenagers .. but still good place for couples and group ..plenty of rides and shops 
1700,5,16-May,Australia,Lively!,"I wasn't initially concerned with visiting Disneyland when I was planning my trip to Tokyo, but I had the best time! I am so glad I came and visited. The staff were lovely, the stores and facade were amazing and the food was definitely interesting! I recommend getting an express pass for a ride so you skip the queue (you can only get one fast pass per hour and it reserves you that privilege for a short time frame) and then using that period to shop around and eat. The queue's are disappointingly long, but hey, it is Disneyland after all! There was no way of getting around the whole place in a day, next time I would probably buy a 2-day pass to really enjoy everything and not feel rushed for time. The queue's can last up to 2 hours per ride, so if you want to ride as many as you can then it would be incredibly difficult for a one-day pass. Be careful of scammers at the entrance!"
1701,5,16-Apr,Israel,best disney park in the world!,best disney park in the world! we already visited hong kong and orlando before. this one is the best.the most amazing lights show on the evening parade.great for kids and their parents :)
1702,4,16-Jun,India,Kids paradise!,"Its require minimum a day to cover disneyland. Tickets are easily available over the counter, expect long queues if visiting on a weekend. Must watch evening parade and castle show. Overall a great experience."
1703,5,16-Jun,Malaysia,Wish to come back here again and visits all attractions they have,"My husband who at first was a bit reluctant to go here due to the crowdedness, ended up enjoyed the most here with our 2 little kids. Although the youngest could not enjoy some rides due to height limitation (she is only 3 years old and <100cm), we had so much fun together. I booked the tickets online and printed them at home, brought and showed them to the staff at the entrance, no hassle. Unfortunately we were unable to visit all places because we were exhausted and had to catch the direct bus from Disneyland to Chofu train station. The staff at their bus stop were friendly and helpful even though they made announcements in Japanese, we somehow managed to reach Chofu train station in less than an hour. We decided to take the bus based on the recommendations we found on the internet. It was worth it because we do not have to drag ourselves with the kids to the train stations and getting off and on changing trains/lines to get back to our homestay in Inagi. "
1704,5,16-Jun,United Kingdom,Beautiful park,"Bought four day tickets for myself, my mother and my 8 year old son and we had a fantastic visit. The park is absolutely immaculate and the attention to detail is second to non. We visited on weekdays and at some points it was fairly busy and fastpasses had all gone towards late afternoon, I don't think I would like to go on a weekend as I have read wait times can get up to 3 hours for some rides. The merchandise is simply the best I have ever seen in a Disney park, so much better than the American parks."
1705,5,16-May,Netherlands,Friendliest Magic Kingdom in the world,"We visited all the Disney parks in the world and while this is not the best Magic Kingdom in the world it is definitely the friendliest! Castmembers are happy, friendly and that rubs of on you. The park has great versions of classic Disney rides but also has some very unique offerings like Monsters Inc and Winnie the Pooh. Don't miss the Dreamlights parade at night it will blow your mind. Be sure to use fastpass because for a couple of rides you really need this, Splash Mountain is a must! Don't let the crowds discourage you, just enjoy the atmosphere."
1706,4,16-May,United States,Nice day trip,Fun day for two adults in their 20's. Many of the rides are geared towards children but we still managed to have a good time. The fast pass system is really great and allowed for us to ride all the big rides in a timely manner. We took a bus direct from Shinjuku station - easy and affordable!
1707,5,16-May,Indonesia,Love This Place,The biggest theme park i ever visited. Has so many attraction and show. Don't miss the night parade of disney princess and mickey. Better to come before the gate opened. So you can has the chance to take the fast line ticket. 
1708,5,16-Apr,United States,Perfect for young kids,"We visited Disneyland the day after visiting DisneySea. My young daughter definitely enjoyed Disneyland over DisneySea as there were more rides and attractions suited for her age and low adventure level (she is 8). If you aren't a big thrill seeker and want something for younger kids, I would recommend this park over DisneySea. Also, bring cash if you plan on buying snacks from the little kiosks stationed at different areas of the parks. They have these popcorn stands that sell different flavors and they're so damn delicious, especially the honey flavor. Some take credit cards but not all. My husband went searching for an ATM, found one at or near the entrance, but it did not accept our card.  "
1709,5,16-May,Australia,The excitement is contagious!,"Let me start by saying I'm not a huge fan of Disney (yeah I know I'm weird).  However we have been to Tokyo Disney twice with our young children and I loved it both times!  The lines can be very crowded as you can expect, but everything ran smoothly.  Even when you park your pram there are attendants who kindly move it for you as people get off rides to ensure that space is efficiently used.  Everyone is so excited to be here (compared to say Disneyland in LA) that you cannot help but get into the spirit of things.The parades are absolutely fantastic and I recommend getting a spot about 20 mins in advance to get a good unobstructed view.  We were there for about 10 hours and were exhausted but only went on a few rides.  We will go again when we return to Tokyo, my 4 year old daughter still has fond memories of Tokyo Disney from last year as well as this year!"
1710,5,16-May,United Kingdom,THE WORLD'S BEST DISNEYLAND,"Having been Orlando 3 times, Paris once and Hong Kong Disneyland, this by far the best Disneyland, so good I brang my children here twice in a week. The staff are incredible, polite, happy and willing to help you no matter what. We had one lady walk us half way around the park to show us where the baby changing facilities where because she couldn't speak English. The firs day we went it rained the entire afternoon and we still had an amazing day, it is that good. The merchandise really is special, don't miss out on the popcorn pots.I took my 1 year old and 2 year and they got to go on nearly everything, it was the perfect day. If I was to go Disneyland again, I'd go back to Tokyo, nowhere else compares."
1711,5,16-Jun,Malaysia,Disney tour,Wonderful place to be in . JUNE weather is perfect. Suggest to just take the local rapid train there and not waste money on taxi or bus
1712,5,16-Jun,Singapore,Magical land,"The last time I was in Tokyo Disneyland was 1985. This time round, the park have not aged, instead it got younger and more vibrant. Park maintenance was great, everything works. The entire park was clean and crowd control was good. The classic rides such as the jet pack, racing cars and of course, it's a small world are still there. Then there are new additions of Star Wars and Monster inc that makes the park even more interesting. A typical queue takes at least 30 minutes. The more popular ones may take up to a couple of hours. And of course, do make full use of your fast pass to get to the ride quicker. A great place to spend time, and when time is concerned, you will most probably need 2 days to cover the park"
1713,5,16-Apr,N/A,Looooove it,"That was my very first time going to disneyland and it was great. The minus thing is just a long queue for everything (toilet,foods,rides). But it's worth it,especially if you are a fan of disney. From my experience,i spent almost 12 hours there but only could play 4 rides (monster inc,space mountain,buzz lightyear,haunted mansion) and watched 2 parades."
1714,5,16-May,Japan,My third time,"This was my third time going to Disneyland, Tokyo.  It was good because it was during the week and there was not as many people there.  The times to get on attractions was almost non-existent for most.  The people working there are the most amazing people.  They are always waving and smiling whether they are on duty or off.  Just amazing atmosphere!"
1715,5,15-Jul,United States,Not just another Disney,"My son and I, visiting Tokyo after he graduated from High School decided we needed to visit Disney in Tokyo. If you are a Disney fan, why not? Though the overall experience was ""Disney"" there were many cultural differences which made the experience new and fun. Like the snacks! While you can find some of the same sickly sweet snacks you would find in the US (not many), we found a lot of frozen fruit on sticks instead of ice cream pops and flavored popcorn, like pepper and green tea and strawberry. It was just these little differences that made it a fun, new experience."
1716,1,16-May,Australia,Tokyo Disneyland ThemePark,"Overcrowded Park & Excessively Long Lines.I have been to my share of theme parks, waiting 2 hours in a line for a 5 minute ride is not my idea of a good time.    Waiting 45 minutes to get something to eat or drink is also bad service.Disneyland theme park in tokyo was poorly run, and a small number of characters around.   Take my advice, skip the theme park, go to Kyoto and check out the temples, you will have a much better time."
1717,5,16-Jun,Australia,A dream come true,Having never been to Disneyland i decided that tokyo should be my first.Wow it is amazing.I think i went on every ride some more than once.Be warned its a japanese theme park and everything is in japanese. The food is aimed at a japanese crown and is slightly westernized.Once you get over the fact its a japanese theme park you will have a great time.The food here isnt badly priced. Water is free all over the park and there is plenty of toilets.Definitely on my list to go back.Unfortunately we didnt get to see the full night show as it rained both times.
1718,5,16-May,Indonesia,My favorite Disneyland in the world!,"Every time I come to Japan, I always make sure I spend at least 1 day in Tokyo Disneyland. I have been to the other Disney parks in the States and Hong Kong, and Tokyo Disneyland is definitely my favorite! For one, the people and staff here are also so orderly and nice! And it is always so clean too! I also love how the Japanese are big on souvenirs, so there is always so many cute merchandises to choose from.But there also a huge downside to the park - it is ALWAYS crowded! It doesn't matter if you come on a weekday or rainy day, be prepared to face a huge crowd when you come to Tokyo Disneyland. Even when it is supposed to be a ""non-crowded"" day, expect lines for popular rides such as ""Pooh's Honey Hunt"" and ""Splash Mountain"" to be about 60 to 90 minutes (it can be up to 180 minutes during peak season). But rides that are not as popular as ""Haunted Mansion"" or ""It's a small world"" will be typically around 30 minutes.But don't let the crowd deter you. All it takes is careful planning and you should be able to thoroughly enjoy the park. Be sure to fully utilize the Fast Pass and you should be able to ride at least 10 rides in a day. The 2 most popular rides currently appears to be Pooh's Honey Hunt and Monster Inc. Be sure to catch the parades too! The music are always so catchy and addictive! Personally, I would recommend the night parades more, but they are all fun to watch :)"
1719,5,16-Apr,Philippines,We love Tokyo Disneyland!,"My family and I (1 child, 3 years old) spent 2 days here. My daughter loved, and so did we!The Japanese are very disciplined when it comes to cleanliness, falling in line, and being polite. All the restrooms were clean and well-stocked with toilet paper and soap. They provide cubicles that have child seats on the wall and toilet seats with potty rings/training seats for toddlers. It's been around for a long time so everything runs well. All the kinks have been ironed in their system. Excellent selection of rides. The parades were a sight to see. The cast members are all friendly. Try the popcorn! They come in a lot of flavors like curry, soy sauce, and caramel and you can get them in cute character tubs."
1720,4,16-May,Singapore,Must go for young kids,My kid was never a disney fan until this trip to disneyland. She got lost in the magical wonderland and was a fan of mickey minnie pluto and others. The japanese were obsessed with buying the merchandise and we got hooked on to hunting for the goods which were sold at exclusive spots.
1721,5,16-May,N/A,Fantastic park ,"I have now been to Disneyland, Disney World and Disneyland Paris but Tokyo Disney has to be the best experience I have had. The park is so clean and the staff are wonderful. Queues were not bad at all, actually some rides were shockingly easy to get on. Pirates of the Caribbean was 5 mins all day! Which compared to Los Angeles (1hr+) was delightful. Food was great, we ate at Blue Bayou and Queen of Hearts. Both were great and with good timing not too busy. Notable rides for little ones were River Cruise, It's a small world, Tiki Room with Stitch, Monsters Inc and many more. No rides broke down on our trip. It wasn't too crowded on a weekday which is when I would recommend going to get the best value.  "
1722,4,16-May,India,Great for kids..and adults too,"Awesome destination, full day plan. When we visited in May, the crowd was lesser and that gave us a better experience. FastPass is a super system and you need to approach it with a set strategy.Cons: Very very difficult to get vegetarian food. There was only one reservation which had priority seating. A definite area for improvement for Disneyland Tokyo."
1723,5,16-May,Malaysia,Must Go!,It is recommend to utilise the FAST PASS to organise your day in Disneyland as the waiting time for a game more than an hour!
1724,5,16-Apr,Canada,Wonderful Disney Experience!,"Having been to the two California Disney parks, Disney World in Florida and Disneyland Paris, Disneyland Tokyo is a wonderful park that mirrors the original Disneyland. The two Tokyo Disney parks have the best staff that we have encountered: super friendly, helpful and they go out of their way to provide an exceptional magical experience!  Luckily for us, we went at one of the least busiest times of the year (in the rain) and managed to go on the most popular rides multiple, multiple times! (Seven times on Space Mountain in one day alone).  We managed to walk right up onto the rides with little to no queuing at all (unheard of for any Disney park we have been to): Google Tokyo Disneyland Crowd Calendar 2016 to help plan your trip. All in all, this is a must see if you have a couple free days in Tokyo. We visited April 7 ‚Äì 9, 2016."
1725,5,16-Apr,New Zealand,Wednesday was good choice to avoid congestion,"This must be one of the best place to visit for family, especially with young children. I did research before visiting, and pickup the right date, so my family could enjoy Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain, and others within 6 hours. Usually, waiting time for each is a few hours but we did not queue much. As far as I know Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday are extremely bus. Wednesday can be good as long as it is not linked to public holidays."
1726,5,16-May,Thailand,Magic Kingdom,A sunny day in Tokyo Disneyland created a memorable experience for your life. Kids love it and adults enjoy it.The queue management in Tokyo Disneyland is 9/10 as well as the restroom.Staff are friendly.A place that I would like to revisit if going to Japan!
1727,5,16-Mar,United States,Beats Disneyland Paris!,"Even though most everything is Japanese and people generally do not speak English, we still enjoyed our time at this park, more so than Disneyland Paris. It's comparable to Disneyland Anaheim. One thing they didn't have were photopass photographers on duty all day. They appeared unexpectedly and randomly, but then a long line would form instantaneously."
1728,5,16-May,Australia,Brilliant ,This is an amazing place! I can't believe how much fun I had. 35 and dancing around to Disney stuff... The difference with Disney in the USA to Tokyo is that the entire crowds get into everything. Everyone sings and dances and gets right into it! It's seriously like being in a Disney themed High School Musical movie. So much fun! 
1729,5,16-Apr,Thailand,Just amazing and one day is not enough!,"I visited the Tokyo Disneyland on the last day when staying in Tokyo, just about a half-day tour before flying home in the same evening as it is closed to the hotel I stay, Hilton Tokyo Bay. It's huge and definitely a paradise for kids and young-at-heart travelers. Although you have one full day, it is not enough. My recommendation is to stay at the surrounded hotels; there are couple hotel brands for you to choose, and buy 2-3 days package so you will be able to play most of the amazing machine, watch the parades, and shows.Great place to visit with a group of friends or family."
1730,5,16-Apr,United States,Disneyland with a Japanese sensibility,Even though this looks like other Disneylands it is decidedly different.  Guests seem to be more considerate and children better behaved. The cast members tried very hard to be helpful to us as English speakers. The Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall is incredibly decorated.  All the restaurants have pictures or wax models of the menu so it isn't difficult to order. The Pooh's Hunny Hunt ride might sound like a kids ride but I loved the trackless technology and effects. Most other rides are similar to Disney parks elsewhere. Their Electric Parade was gorgeous. Unfortunately the nightly fireworks were cancelled due to weather (wind across Tokyo Bay I think). This is another fabulous place for a Disney fan.
1731,5,16-May,N/A,Fabulous ,"Wow wow wow loved every minute of it . First ride we got to go on was star tours ( starwars) best ride 3D I have ever experienced. I am a massive fan and this more than lived up to your expectations. Nothing can compare to being a kid for the day . This place is for the young to old and beyond;-) , We went Wednesday so guess not to long to stand in line . Everyone was supper friendly and a wonderful day was had . This is a must go for couples . Find your inner child and just go for it . Top marks . If it's a dull day take a sweater it can get a little windy . "
1732,5,16-Mar,Malaysia,The happiest place on Earth for kids,Wonderfully clean with friendly staff! Love the fact that we could bring in our own packed lunch and snacks!
1733,4,16-May,Brunei,Happy Happy and Happy,The environment is great especially for family. Games and programs are mostly for children. Can see everyone smile and enjoy in the park. It's worth to go at least once. Perhaps the only concern is the entrance ticket is bit high.
1734,5,15-Nov,Singapore,Really worth going at least once!,Not a disney fans but still love it! All the rides and entertainment is just too awesome. Great for family and friends.
1735,5,15-Nov,Australia,"Lovely, great family activity.","Lovely, great family activity. Go early and enjoy all day. You can get a ticket to short cut the cue every second hour. Search for the ticket points."
1736,4,16-Jan,Australia,Happiest place on earth,"Went with my husband and 4yo girl last January. The place was packed despite it being dead of winter. This was our first visit to a Disneyland and it did not disappoint. The crowds and queues notwithstanding, it truly IS the happiest place on earth. The parade brought tears to my eyes! :) The popcorn craze is a rip-off and I'm not sure about having to haul back the collectible containers all the way back to Australia but hey, we do not have a Disneyland here in Australia so might as well :) PS. We did Disneyland on first day and Disneysea on second day. We didn't have enough time to explore all of Disneyland in just 1 day because of the insane queues so next time, we'll probably do 2 days."
1737,4,16-May,Australia,Great for young kids,"This was our first time to a Disneyland so were not quite sure what to expect, got there about a half hour before gates opened and there was already quite a decent lineup. Once the gates did open however they got people through quite quickly. It was a fun day with western photos, etc but as an adult with no children to worry about I probably enjoyed Universal studios more. The staff at Disneyland are very friendly and great with young children as you would expect."
1738,5,16-May,Philippines,Happiest place in Japan indeed!,"This disneyland was so huge, you cant possibly try it out all (rides and entertainment) on one day unless your not human :)Overall experience was so fun, we havent tried all rides here but the kids love it so much. During the time we were there the afternoon parade was cancelled bec the wind was blowing so heavy and it pose a risk in the characters riding ther carousel.However they still manage to put up a small parade which is quite entertaining too as an alternative.I specially loved the electric lights parade at the evening which is very spectacular...my children and the children were so delighted. I recommend visiting this place if your in Tokyo!"
1739,4,16-Apr,Germany,Fantastic day after all the scary stories about how busy it gets,"I read the reviews before we went (all black days) and got really worried. This was our first visit to a Disney Park and I read all the tips and tricks so we were more then an hour before the park opened there and there already were at least 50 persons waiting before every entrance. When the park finally opened and all the staff stand there with signs don't run we ran like everybody else (crazy!!!!) to the first fast pass machine, got ourselves a fast pass for Monsters Inc and walked very fastto Space Mountain. As we were so early there was no que yet so we came out 10 minutes after park opening. Went to It's a small world and the haunted house with both no waiting time and the we realized it was not that busy and did every attraction that was on our list and many more. Saw both parades and the show Once upon a time at Cinderella and the fire works. We were able to get 3 other fast passes. The longest we waited was for 35 minutes for Splash Mountain. We stayed in the Hilton which was perfect for us and we went back to our hotel to have a 2 hour nap in the afternoon so we were all well rested for round 2. The weather was great and we all (also my husband and I) had a great day! Just check what kind of day you are going. We were there in a yellow day and this was really great!"
1740,5,16-Apr,United States,Always fun at Disney,"This is the first Disneyland we have been to that was outside of the US.  The park and attractions are just like Magic Kingdom in Orlando, except everyone speaks Japanese, even Mickey.  There is however some differences which you will notice throughout the day.  We went in April and it was Easter theme in Disney.  They have different popcorn stands with different flavors.  Some unique ones were curry, and soy sauce and buttered popcorn.  Duffy the bear seems to be a big character here.  They have hidden vending machines through out the park, but they blend in with the d√©cor of the park.  They have character meet and greet throughout the park, like the princesses along with the princes and a few old characters like Scrooge McDuck, and Fifi Pig.  They have parades, which is mostly in Japanese.  The food is more geared to the Asian palate.  They do have the giant turkey legs, but they also have teriyaki chicken legs, which were so tasty.  They also have this churro like pastry filled with chocolate or cr√®me.  The park is super clean.  They have a monorail but it is an extra fee.  We went on a weekday so the park wasn‚Äôt crowded.  The lines for rides are reasonable and some were 5 min wait or less.  I do hear if you come on weekends or certain holidays the park is packed and meets capacity.  In terms of ticket prices to the park, it is cheaper than the ticket prices to Disney in Orlando.  Overall a great experience, nice day trip, and our son certainly loved it."
1741,4,16-May,Canada,Great for kids,"Took my teens here on out recent visit to Tokyo.  While we had fun, the kids far preferred DisneySea.  Tokyo DisneyLand is very familiar to DisneyLand in Aneheim but seemed far busier."
1742,4,16-Apr,Australia,The happiest place on earth,"We really enjoyed our day at Tokyo Disneyland. I have been many times but this was my first with my husband and 3 boys aged 8, 5 & 2.5We bought discount tickets at Family Mart convenience store prior to arriving which saved is quite a lot. Took the train to Maihama station.The most popular ride was Monsters Inc so we got a fast pass at lunchtime but ended up not using it as it said to come back at 8:20pm. By 8pm there was not a long line.Fast passes aren't really that fast! It was a weekday and not school holidays when we went. Not over crowded but still at least 30min wait for almost everything which is so boring for the kids and a shame to waste time standing in a line. That's the only negative...We didn't get all of the park covered, so two days would have been better but we didn't have the extra time to come back this trip.Kids loved the Star Wars attraction (2yr old not allowed tho), space mountain and it's a small world.We stayed for the light show on the Disney castle which was good.Will definitely go back again hopefully spend more time there next time."
1743,4,16-May,Australia,Lots of fun,"Of course this is fun, it is DISNEYLAND!  The fast pass is a great idea. There aren't a lot of scary rides (shame as I love scary rides) but the Disney atmosphere is everywhere. The crowds were vast. Great day of fun."
1744,4,16-May,Australia,You cant go wrong with Disney!,This is like all your other Magical Kingdom parks except its sooo clean and orderly! Everythign Japan does is done so with class and this is no exception. The park is immaculately clean and all staff so helpful. We read everywhere that the lines to ride are crazy here but this is not what we experienced thankfully! We went the week after Golden week and it was almost dead. No crowds and fast lines for all the rides. 
1745,5,16-May,New Zealand,Loved it very helpful staff,Great day food wasn't crazy expensive My four year old loved it we never found Elsa though :( still need more detail even more well this is just to hard 
1746,5,15-Dec,Indonesia,tokyo disney land and sea world,"this disney land and sea world is wonderful, lots to do and see, lots of fun, some of the rides where scary for me but I'm sure they are great. being in japan there where lots of anime girls dressed up which was great to see."
1747,5,16-Apr,United States,"Great!  afterall, it is a Disney park.","Disney always gets 5 stars.  The usual Disneyland attractions but almost no one speaks English.  This surprised me since I always thought of Disney as an International park.  I didn't go to the shows since I would not be able to understand.  I did see the parades and as always, really enjoyed them.  I saw all I wanted in a Day but if more crowded would need more time."
1748,5,16-Apr,Canada,Fun!,This was my last of the Disney theme parks to visit and it did not disappoint.  Had lots of fun and great weather on the day of my visit.  Locals tend to go in groups and dress alike make if it fun to people watch. So nice to see people enjoying their day together.  
1749,4,16-May,N/A,Happiest Place to Be!,"Happiness everywhere in the park, unless you didn't get a fast pass. Whenever you can, get the fast pass. However if you come on a non peak period's day, most of the rides are pretty fast. The best ride I had was Space Mountain, really thrilling. The wait time was 45 minutes, but I managed to get a fast pass. That reduced to about 5-8 minutes. The fast pass works by placing your ticket's qr code into a machine near the ride, you will obtain a ticket with the time stamped. I managed to get a fast pass for 3 rides in the same day. The most disappointing thing for me was the fireworks which was non-existent. There was a few flares, that's it. Maybe the weather was not good, but I definitely did not get to see any fireworks.The parade on the other hand was great. It was enjoyable for all my friends. The day time parade was better than the night electric one. Food wise, I managed to get my hands on some Green Alien(Toy Story) Mochi which was fantastic. The chicken leg was better than the turkey leg due to it's tenderness and juiciness. The staff there were extremely polite and helpful. They did a fantastic job keeping the park clean and organized. Kudos to the staff."
1750,5,16-May,Australia,Wonderful world,"It is a fantastic place, good for family n kids to come. Recommend fast pass ticket to play all rides, otherwise you will spend most time for queuing. Even you don't like rides, it is still a nice place to take picture with all famous Disney character.  "
1751,5,16-Jan,Malaysia,A childhood dream fulfilled,"Many friends of mine said Disneyland is for kids, but for me, I will definitely say it's not only for kids but for adults who love Disney characters. I was so excited and happy when I enter the Mickey arch and the moment I get in to Disneyland entrance I was like Oh My God, I am here finally and I almost tears because of my excitement and my childhood dream was fulfilled.I spent the whole day yet i can't take all the ride due to long Q. You have to choose which ride you wanted the most and go and get your fast past. Fast Past helps you to avoid Q yet you can spend your time for photo shooting or walking around while waiting for your ride time slot. For photograph with Mickey you are required to be a little patient for the waiting time. It takes about 45minutes for your turn. Just enjoying yourself with all the lovely Disney character and the ride is awesome! I love Disneyland!"
1752,5,16-May,United States,Luck with timing = awesome visit and a new popcorn bucket collection,"Just back from Tokyo.  Spent 6 nights at the Disneyland Hotel and 4 days visiting the two parks.  These parks are very popular and we ended up going just after Japan's ""Golden Week"" ended.  There are certain dates in Japan where more holiday time is taken by the population and crowds can soar.  My spouse found a website that listed the typical ""crowd index"" on a daily and monthly basis and we picked days that were ""lower"" than the norm.  And start really early with the ""fast pass"" routine - we looked at an ""ride wait"" app the day before our visit to see what rides were most popular and we made a beeline to that fastpass when the parked opened - and then went to wait in line at ""ride #2"" on our list.  As soon as another FP became available off we went to get the next one on our ""long line"" list.  Worked awesome - but, yep, those FP's are popular and will disappear as the day goes by.The days we picked ended up also being overcast and raining - which we thought would hinder our enjoyment of the park.  Not so - this park is well prepared for non-sunshine conditions.  Main Street is covered by a glass roof structure and lots of rides are indoors.It's hard to predict the weather so wear good waterproof shoes (Merrill makes great ones - though pricy - as does Sketchers), zip-off pants to convert pants to shorts, pack a light long sleeve layer, raincoat and umbrella.  Sounds like a lot but I carried the family supplies in a single backpack.  Nothing ""bulky"" - go lightweight.  Or put the stuff in one of the many storage lockers available.We ended up there in May 2016 and they were still celebrating ""Easter"".  Which meant lots of colorful eggs and bunnies, etc.  This doesn't seem to me as the typical ""USA Christian Easter"" type thing - it's more of a Japanese ""cherry blossom"" spring type of thing.    We are AP holders for Disneyland CA so we covered TDL rides in one day.  Yes, the fireworks were canceled.  But the Castle show went on as scheduled.We planned 2 days at each park and used day 2 at TDL to do the Easter Egg hunt.  My genius spouse chose the ""Master"" level figuring this was a kids game.  Yes, they have kid's games - this wasn't anywhere close to that.  It was a riddle just like out of amazing race.  But, in our case, we had 4 people and other ""hunters"" to tackle it.  Still took us about 4 hours to find all the answers and we walked a good portion of the park again.  Thankfully it was drizzling so it made the ""walkabout"" more of a ""walk"" than a workout.If you are a Disney fan and have been to a DL park - Florida, California, Paris or Hong Kong then you can probably cover TDL in 1 day but if you can allocated 1.5 or 2 you will have time to relax and enjoy it more.  We started with rides not available at DLC - my daughter was especially happy to find the canoe attraction open.If you are a Disney shopping fanatic - well, don't go with high expectations.  The majority of the merchandise, from what I observed, is ""food"" - as in cookies, cakes, soups, etc.  We bought some to try and it was very good so we bought more to take home with us.  This sure seemed like a more practical ""souvenir"" to take home but the thought of filling my luggage with ""food"" did have me thinking twice about which to buy.  Obviously they have a lot of other ""stuff"" but the clothing didn't scream ""buy me"" to us and my desire to find a TDL backpack went unfulfilled.Besides, it was very important for us to save luggage space for the popcorn buckets.  OMG they are adorable and very popular.  In fact, we bought most of the available character buckets on day 1 and rather than eating an overload of popcorn they offer vouchers that you can redeem on another day.  We held off from buying more until I knew I could fit them in our luggage - yes, we planned for this - i packed a wheeled duffle bag inside one of our 3 pieces of luggage for just ""stuff"" we'd buy in Japan.  Seemed like a good idea heading there... except soft luggage and souvenirs = broken stuff.  So, we tried to put breakable stuff in extra padding but still ended up with one broken glass mug handle.  Those dang ""extensions"" off main items always seem to end up broken.After confirming we could fit more buckets we looked for them on day 2 - oops - couldn't find Donald Duck... yeah, that would be the one that had limited availability now... turns out they have a book of available buckets and where to find them.  This was almost as much of a ""hunt"" as the Easter Egg thing.  Some of the buckets didn't interest us but now I kind of regret not making room for Dumbo or buying DD when we had that chance.  They also sell popcorn buckets in the store but you can't get a discounted refill if you buy them there.  And don't count on them being there either.  On our departure day we went back to the store and all the buckets were GONE.  Oh boy was I glad I didn't make the spouse wait to get them.All things considered - this was a fantastic visit and one I'd highly recommend.  And, if you are there for a ""scavenger"" hunt - by all means give it a go - but only after you've been on all the rides you really wanted to hit."
1753,5,16-Apr,United States,"Spacious, super clean, very polite, tons of fun!","We frequently visit Disneyland in California and have vacationed at Disney  World in Florida -- we love Disney parks -- the Tokyo Disney Resort was awesome and set a whole new standard.  The parks are large and spacious, so it doesn't feel like your constantly bumping into people.  The parks in the USA are clean, but the parks in Japan are spotless.  The employees and other guests are all polite, and we had a great time.Tokyo Disneyland was really fun to see.  The World Bazaar and the castle were very neat.  Pooh's Honey Hunt, and Monster's Inc. Ride and Go Seek were our kids' favorite rides there and they both LOVED the magicians in the magic shop -- they were great and did like a mini-show just for our kids.  It was fun to see their parades and to see some of the classic Disney attractions that have been removed/replaced from Disneyland in California (Country Bear Jamboree -- narrations in Japanese, but songs in English; Swiss Family Robinson Treehouse; Electrical Parade, etc.). The food and snacks were all good and reasonably priced.  Be smart in using FastPasses and rider swaps and you can do just about everything you would want to do multiple times*.  We did a three day pass, so we had one full day at DisneySea, then a full day at Disneyland, then we split our last day between the two parks.  We could've used one more day to see and experience everything*, but that's all the time we had in that part of Japan.*We went during a great time of year -- April 18-20 -- it's right after the Cherry Blossom season and right before Golden week, so overall park attendance was pretty low when compared to other times of year."
1754,2,16-Apr,United Kingdom,Far too crowded,This is the second time visiting Disney Sea. The park itself is very good but there were just too many people which made it impossible to really fully utilise the attractions. We have a disabled daughter and Tokyo Disney does not handle disabled people as effectively as its sister sites in Florida or Paris. 
1755,5,16-May,United Kingdom,A must if your a Disney fan!!!,Went to Disneyland Tokyo yesterday with my boyfriend. We absolutely loved the day we spent there. We arrived at 10am in the morning and were there until the very end at 10pm but were truly satisfied that we had explored everything and even had time to visit the shops. We picked a really good day as we didn't have to que for much the most was 15minutes which is really reasonable for Disneyland. Coming from England it was really nice to experience Disneyland in Japan. The staff were so kind and helpful and despite not being able to understand anything if you love Disney you will still get the gist of it all. This did not dampen our day at all. Lots of food options and generally just a really happy place. Staff took their role seriously to ensure safety but also to enhance your experience. They were all extremely happy and definitely appeared to love their job. We are big kids at heart so had a great day. As we stayed until the end it was beautiful to see the castle at night and they even put on a spectacular show as a finale with lots of lights and burst of fire. I think there would have been fireworks but because it was raining unfortunately we didn't see any. Great day out for young and old!!
1756,5,16-Apr,United States,Spectacular,"Having gone to all the Disney stuff in the US I was not looking forward to this hot mess, but I was so happy I went! It was so amazing to see everything dubbed in Japanese - I got a huge kick out of it.  The food was great, the rides were all localized and the people made the day so special for me family who had never been. The parade was in Japanese and just so well put together - the families say in the ground and watched as folks tried to find Easter Eggs and we loved every minute. If you have time, go - you will not regret it and get PopCorn!!"
1757,4,16-Apr,Malaysia,A Fun Park For Family,"We were there as a family on a weekday and there is a huge  crowd of people, mostly Japanese. It was drizzling almost the whole day but it did not dampen the spirit of the crowd using umbrella and raincoat to go round the park.The parade still proceeded with the Disney characters in transparent rain coat even though the announcement said the performance is cancelled due to weather.The queue for some of the ride took 45min to an hour. It is good to get a fast pass so that you only come in at a certain time and you don't have to wait for so long.You can find food to eat easily but need to queue fro some of the restaurants.The finale at 9.30 at night is a fantastic  firework display followed by a 15 minutes of laser display show using the castle as the screen. An experience not to be missed.It's a fun park for a family trip but try to avoid weekend with huge crowd so that you have to queue longer for everything"
1758,4,15-Dec,N/A,for fun,"like a dream places for me, when i was young l watched cartoon that almost characters was there like micky mouse, minie mouse, like made me feel back to past again ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1759,5,15-Jun,N/A,Loved it!,Amazing park.Great set up.The fast pass system is great and the rides are so fun. Especially the new star wars one.Make sure you get there early and use the fast pass system 
1760,5,16-Apr,Indonesia,highly recomend for kids,"if u bring your kid, then this place is a must! the place was clean, maybe u should arrive at the area at 9.30 just to be save and pls make sure u already bought the ticket, i bought the ticket in jakarta its cheaper. walk slowly enjoy the surroundings. i'm an adult but i had a great time!"
1761,4,16-May,Australia,Very good but Disneysea is better!,"Disneyland is definitely great fun but right next door, Disneysea is even better! Be sure to get your free ""fast passes""from the main rides (mentioned on your park map) they will shorten your queue time cosiderably! I'd been to Disneysea on the previous day and I thought the staff seemed a lot happier and more helpful at Disneysea than at Didneyland? Otherwise, the theming and rides at Disneyland is very good and the overall value for money at both parks is great! Make sure you buy at least the ""two day passport"" which saves you money and lets you visit both theme parks on consecutive days. Have fun!"
1762,5,15-Jun,United Kingdom,Relieving childhood memories and fantasies,"Took my son and hubby here to experience Disneyland. My son was super excited seeing all the characters he knows from his Disney show. The was a parade passing by the Castle that lasted almost and hour. We then tried the rides, but the queue was super long! Tried to get hold of the express tokens, but they were out by the time we learned about them. Such a shame. But nevertheless, there's a lot to do at the park. My son particularly enjoyed the car ride at the car track since he was the one driving, the mini roller-coaster ride, going into mickey's house and the finale watching Frozen premier."
1763,4,16-May,China,It's okay,"It's fine if you haven't been to Disney World in Florida... Otherwise, they need to do a lot of improvement... Start with the music that does not give you that enchanted feeling the moment you stepped inside Disney. "
1764,5,16-May,Japan,perfect timing,"we visited the park when the weather is perfect, not too hot, not too cold, no rain. during weekdays, so the line up wasnt too bad around 20-30 minutes each attraction. we covered almost everything in one day from opening to closing. there are lot of toilets every where and they are clean, a very big plus point for me. other people who visited during summer told me that they had to line up for toilets, we were lucky we didnt have to. not all food are expensive. you can get curry rice for usd 6. drinks are more expensive then outside the park, but there are lots of drinking fountain everywhere for free dirnk, just bring your bottle and fill them up. seating areas also sufficient during our visits. overall, i think the key is to go during weekdays to avoid over crowds and enjoy the park to the fullest."
1765,4,16-Apr,United States,Good time or Not as bad as reviewed,"I was debating on visiting based on some of the reviews I had read online but decided at the last minute, ""sure, why not, when I will he here again?""I was lucky as the crowds were not bad.  When I got there, the line was pretty long before I figured out it was the line to enter.  I thought initially it was the line to get tickets.  The line to buy a ticket was like 2 people.  Getting in was pretty fast.  Even with all the people out front, it did not feel full.  The park is really clean.  They have their version of the penny machines which I started to pick up as cool little gift trinckets.  They have seasonal and yearly ones.  One thing I notied different is the lack of pins.  One of my friends is a big pin collector and they do not have as many options.  It was a little hard to find actual Tokyo Disney branded items.  They do have a lot of t-shirts I was unfamiliar with.  I usually do not but t-shirts bur prefer pins or magnets.It is a lot easier to get pictures with the character here I notice than in the states.  I noticed they are near the entrance in the afternoon between the entrance where you present your ticket and first set of of shops"
1766,5,16-May,Australia,A dream come True,"This is surely a dream come true and the excitement I had was just indescribable! Everything u want to do and see as an child in one compound. A very clean & safe environment too. A must mention is that though the people in Japan can't really understand much English, they are the most helpful souls on earth! "
1767,2,16-May,N/A,I fell asleep waiting,"Me and my family came here to have some magical time (duh, it's Disneyland). Instead, we face a impossibly long queue at every games and food stand. Who could have imagined that we need to wait 2 hours to enter Goofy's house? What's even worse is that when I was queuing for a Mickey Popsicles, the line was cut by the vendor as she said ""sorry, we're sold out"". Right in front of me. Fuming, I stormed off the queue and decided to get something else. Turkey leg came into my mind. So I went searching for the turkey leg stand and I was left flabbergasted by another super long queue. And so I gave up went to shop for souvenirs. Luckily the cashier queue wasn't as long. After going around shopping I sat on a bench waiting at the meeting spot our family decided in case we lost each other, and I fell asleep. At Disneyland. A magical land where dreams come true."
1768,5,16-Apr,Australia,Had a wonderful Day!,"I went here on Friday April 8 and fortunately it was good weather after being wet the previous day.  We were fortunate that we did not have to wait long for most rides. The place is maintained and cleaned well and there are many staff about to offer assistance and directions. The wonderful grand parade had an Easter theme. I was amazed that everyone politely sat on the ground and watched, not standing and blocking the view of others. When we left around 4.45pm we were offered a pass-out stamp to return for the evening. I wish that we could have returned. It is certainly a place for all ages. I am a senior!"
1769,5,16-May,Philippines,World of dreams,Dream come true upon visit...with shows full of happiness and   dreams for anyone who dream of a wonderful world in real.
1770,4,16-Apr,N/A,"It's no Universal Studios, but OK","It's no Universal Studios, but the park is great for family.What's interest me most is Tomorrowland area, cuz they have Star Wars :)Bought myself an R2-D2 Pop Corn :)"
1771,5,15-Jul,United States,Wow its Disneyland,This place is absolutely amazing the rides the light show the food the drinks the staff are just amazing. We unfortunately didnt have as much time as we wouldve liked we went on an evening ticket found it just wasnt enough time to everything. But the time we did have was amazing.
1772,5,16-Jan,United Kingdom,Typical Disney magic,"Loved the Disney magic. It is similar in size to Disneyland in Anaheim,California but the castle is similar to that in Walt disney world in orlando. The Jungle cruise was great especially at night."
1773,5,16-Apr,Netherlands,Totally worth it,"I had a blast and it is so different than the USA ones. They have a bizarre love of popcorn with the weirdest flavours. Not much English in the park, everything is in Japanese icluding the shows but it didn't bother me. Avoid the weekends because it will be crowded. "
1774,4,16-Apr,Australia,"Not as big as we thought it would be, but still fun.","First thing you have to do is go onto their website and check how busy it is on the day you're planning on going. They have a page that shows the percentage booked the park is.  The day we were there (midweek) was around 55-60% from memory and it was great.  Our longest queue was around 60 mins and most were more like 35-40min.As you expect from Disney, it's slick and well run, it's clean and a lot of fun.  We've done Hong Kong Disneyland before and that's our only one to compare to but one thing to keep in mind is that there's only a couple of rides that aren't really designed for little kids. We comfortably did the whole park in a day and if you're prepared to find your inner child then you'll have a fun day."
1775,5,16-Apr,N/A,A big kid again!,"How much fun was this park I became a big kid again. I put on my Minnie Mouse ears and set off on an adventure watching shows and going crazy on rides. No matter how old you are what is more fun than Disneyland. I went on a Tuesday and from what I was told this is one of the slower days. Didnt wait to long for rides in the morning but once all the schools were out by the afternoon the lines soon filled up and the wait longer. If you want to watch the show ""One Mans Dream"" about Walt Disney you need your passport and go into a lotto to get tickets after the first show. The parade was good fun and Japanese know how to let everyone watch a show without the pushing and shoving. I had to get my head around seeing Mickey and Minnie speak Japanese and other characters and also shows sung in Japanese but your in Japan what do you expect but took nothing away from my day. Souvenirs expensive once I converted back to Australian dollar and there are plenty of shops to wander through. Very clean park and plenty of help if you need to find something.  Go and have fun be a kid again ...Enjoy."
1776,3,16-Mar,Australia,Beware the queues!,"I love Disneyland but was so disappointed with the over crowded park & ridiculous queues. All the good rides had queues of 3-4 hours long. This is impossible with little children. Thank goodness for fastpass, but even that was difficult to get unless you arrive very early at opening time. Such a fun park but let down by the overcrowding & queues for everything - toilets, food, rides & gift shops. I could barely move in the gift shops & have never experience so many people in one place. Even 30 minutes just to get a bag of popcorn from a street stand. You couldn't even walk through the streets or shops without brushing up against people constantly.  Disneysea was slightly less crowded. "
1777,5,16-Apr,Japan,Love!,We only had 1 day for Disney so we had to choose either land or sea. I got and read many mixed opinions. Some people like sea better and some land. We decided on Disneyland because it's the most like Disney and its atmosphere/design. I'm so glad we picked it!!! We bought our tickets early and then got there before it opened (highly recommended). We familiarized ourselves with the map (highly recommended) so we didn't waste time. We went on a weekday and stayed all day. Best choice ever! We got about 5 different Fastpasses and rode/saw about everything at least once. The Once Upon a Time show at the end of the night is totally worth it!!!! I thought it was amazing.Definitely worth it and I'd go again in a heartbeat!
1778,4,15-Nov,Malaysia,kids love it,"We came here by Nov 2015. We came before opening time i.e. 8:30 am, there were so crowding seem 1000 people waiting outside already. The park is moderate size, clean and well maintained. Most of the visitors are local. I agree with the other traveler's reviews. Yes, there is too crowding as kids have to waste long time for long queue. Luckily there is a fast-pass machine outside every ride's entrance, we just need to scan the entrance ticket and get a pass to skip for queue up, but this is limit to one time per each ticket.I suggest stay a whole day here as there is a firework show at night. I love the road show and the ambiance of Disneyland. Must come at least once if you gonna to visit Tokyo."
1779,5,15-May,Brazil,"Top quality amusement park, Disney quality!","This was my first visit to Disneyland, and everyone always talked about cleanliness and organzation, and this is of course true for Tokyo Disney! Everything perfectly put, cleaned and organized. Staff really polite and always glad to help (in English).There was a Light Parade on early night, awesome and breath-taking!A special exhibition projected in Princess's Castle also took place, but we didn't know, so we lost our good spot (it was hard to see the animations if you were not on the front.The attractions are not as radical as I imagined, and I lost 2 hours waiting for the wood roller coaster, which was not exciting at all (recommended for kids).You can have really good meals with a fair price. I recommend the Curry from Wood area, Turkey Leg (expensive but worth it!), and Mickey Mouse Sandwich.It was also Easter time, so you could find Egg characters all around the park."
1780,3,16-Mar,Philippines,Patience Is A Virtue If Its A School Holiday,"A very helpful tip: check the Japanese school holidays before going or else you will be queueing for 2 hours in most (famous and thrill) rides. Yes you read it right, 2 hours which happened to us which will really exhaust your patience and will make you APPRECIATE the Japanese much more. You won't see a single face of disappointment on them. As a foreigner, its quite a virtue to muster and master. We ended up just touring the whole place with just two rides under our belt. If you're short on patience then follow my one and only (and very important) advice, (once again) check the school and national holidays. This applies to Disney Sea as well. "
1781,5,15-Oct,Singapore,the electrifying atmosphere,"been to the Disneyland in USA a couple of years back, and in the past 2 years, i went to Tokyo Disneyland twice. The atmosphere is unique. groups of teens dressed like their favourite characters, totally indulgent!And the food, definitely much better than the one in the USA.Disney store has plenty to buy for disney fanatics also"
1782,4,16-Apr,United Kingdom,It's Disney but Japanese!,"It's like they picked up the Magic Kingdom and plonked it down in Japan. All the rides are the same (not a bad thing!!) but in Japanese. I don't think there were any Japan only rides in this park.My favourite thing about Japan Disney was the food, they theme it sooo much better than in other countries. We had Mickey hand shaped bread buns, egg yolks in the shape of a Mickey head, Monsters Inc Mike shaped bread, Toy Story Alien buns. We ate way too much just trying everything.The fast pass system works well, as we had a small child with us we mostly did the gentle rides and we never queued more than 15 minutes. When we arrived it said Star Tours had run out of fast passes which worried my husband but it only had 5 minute queues all day. We stayed until late and got in the big rides like Space Moutain then.People start getting spots for the parade very early. On the maps it says it's not allowed until an hour before but especially for the electrical parade people started earlier. Be prepared to claim your spot early if you want a good one, people lay out mats and get comfy for a long wait. The fireworks weren't on when we visited due to heavy wind, it wasn't very windy at all though which made me wonder how often they got cancelled.One tip which isn't highly publicised, for a lot of the shows they will provide a psp with English subtitles if you ask!"
1783,4,16-Apr,Malaysia,Enjoyable Visit,We actually enjoyed disneyland especially the electric parades.Bring plastic mats for the shows as we sit on the grounds. No halal food provided. Muslim friendly restaurant do serves ebi tempura. Always ask restaurant staff when in doubt as they will share d ingredients of the food served. Avoid schools hols as long queues. 
1784,2,16-Mar,N/A,too crowded to be child friendly,"although it was rainy the whole day, it was still crowded. it's more like for local as some show are in Japanese, and for youngster to feel like a kid, instead of for kids. "
1785,5,16-Apr,Philippines,Happiest place on earth,"Of course if youre going to tokyo. A must see. Though our problem is, the rides/event place have no english translation. But we still had fun."
1786,3,16-Apr,United States,Long waits ,I'm a huge Disney fan and even I was slightly disappointed. The park has a lot of cool things however the waits for the rides were between 160-210 minutes long. We were only able to ride about 4 rides. On the plus side the Queen of Hearts restaurant was amazing!!
1787,5,16-Apr,Australia,The place to go for the young hearted,"I love Disneyland, cost to get in was about YEN7000 which includes all rides and shows.Even in the rain it was fun to be there, we just got very wet. There were rain jackets and umbrellas for sale so after we got our ponchos off we went. There are rides for all levels of thrills, from the merry go round to the roller coasters. We had Mickey Mouse waffles which are a must to try. Loads of shops to buy presents for others or to just treat yourself. Due to the rain we put our backpacks in a locker for the day YEN300, well worth it."
1788,4,16-Mar,United States,Must visit for Disney Park fans!,"We only had a day to spend and didn't feel like we got to really explore the park but we really enjoyed the experience. There's quite a few resources online to help plan your visit but the tips we found most helpful were to stay on property as  the 15 minutes extra was very helpful to get to the Fast Pass machines and attractions. (We grabbed FPs for the two rides that were unique to Japan, Pooh's Hunny Hunt and Monster's Inc.) We also found that the guest are perfectly willing to wait hours for a ride and do so in a polite manner. We didn't find English to be a problem but we didn't really need to go beyond the basics either of ordering food or saying how many for a ride. Maps are available in English, as are the signs for each restaurant/attraction/bathrooms and cast members are perfectly willing to accept gestures and pointing in lieu of Japanese or call someone over who can speak English.  Be sure to look at the lottery system for several of the attractions as well, if you're lucky you'll get a better seat for fireworks/shows. Despite the long waits and crowds, the park was still a wonderful experience with guests being thoughtful and really enjoying themselves. Children are not allowed on shoulders, first rows will sit down and guests will automatically pull down their umbrellas, even if it's drizzling, so that everybody has a good view of parades and fireworks. Cameras are also requested to be held no higher than your head if you're taking pictures. All in all, we enjoyed our experience but think it's going to be a one time thing due to the distance and amount of time/crowds.  Disney fans should really put this and TokyoSea on their lists of parks to visit, both to see the differences (and similarities) as well as experience how different cultures respond to attractions and park itself. (Lots of Duffy, excitement and rock star squealing for parade characters, extremely polite and well mannered 40-60 minute lines for snack carts, automatic and NEAT queuing for everything, efficient transportation / everything starts when as posted, amazing details to everything ...completely mobbed shopping experiences in the stores, despite the lack of merchandise variety.)"
1789,5,15-Sep,United States,Happiest Place on Earth indeed!,"We've celebrated my daughter's 7th birthday at Tokyo Disneyland last year. Although it was rainy, we still managed to enjoy the attractions! The place is huge! Our biggest disappointment was the weather. Due to the heavy rains, the Management decided to cancel the parade. Overall, it was an enjoyable adventure with my 3 kiddos! Hoping to be back again (hopefully it doesnt rain!)!"
1790,5,15-May,Australia,Tokyo Disney land,"We really enjoyed our time here, we spent a whole day wondering around.. Best to get there on opening time as you need to line up for rides and the longer you leave it the longer you wait in the queue ( the Japanese are very patient waiters!! ) so choose the best ride you want to go on and line up for that first .. Be prepared for quite the wait. Amazing amounts of teenage girls in groups all dressed the same, and they are quite happy to pose for photos."
1791,4,15-Dec,Australia,Disney fun but plan ahead,"Tokyo Disneyland is much the same as other Disney parks - for older kids and adults, the highlights are Space Mountain, Thunder Mountain and Splash Mountain (there are no other roller coasters/scary rides, they‚Äôre next door at Disneysea) and for younger kids, head to Fantasyland or Toontown. Whatever you do, don‚Äôt miss Pooh‚Äôs Hunny Hunt - we loved the little touches such as the fact that they pump a honey scent into the air! As with all Disney parks, the theming is really well done, the rides are fun and the parades are excellent. The highlight is the electrical parade in the evening which is absolutely magical, don‚Äôt miss it! Challenges # 1The queues - even though they have the Fastpass system, it just doesn‚Äôt work as effectively here as it seems to in other Disney parks so there is often a 2-3 hour wait for the popular rides. Tip - as soon as you enter the park, run for the ride you want to go on most because by the time you get off, the queue will be 2 hours long. Then you just have to fastpass your way around the rides, filling your in-between time with enjoying the atmosphere or watching the parades. Also, take advantage of the single rider option which is not publicized at all. If you‚Äôre in a position to queue together then sit separately on the ride, this option will cut the wait time down from hours to minutes, it‚Äôs brilliant. Sadly, it‚Äôs only available on Splash Mountain. Challenge # 2The crowds - people camp out along the parade route from the second they enter the park, the restaurants book out and the queues for the rides are 2-3 hours. Tip - check the Disney crowd-meters online before you go and avoid peak periods (weekends, public holidays and school holidays). Challenge # 3The shows are in Japanese (fair enough, you are in Japan after all!)  Tip - save yourself time and skip things such as Lilo and Stitch and the Country Bears Theatre unless you just want a break from the crowds. The Tiki Rooms has an English audio guide though.Challenge # 4The food ‚Äì Japanese people book Disney restaurants days in advance, so even if you try to make a reservation as soon as the park opens, all the restaurants are full. The food quality/variety at the take-away eateries is pretty average and there are very few options for vegetarians. Tip ‚Äì if there is a restaurant you really want to dine at, make a reservation several days beforehand. However, I would 100% recommend going back to your hotel for lunch/dinner (an added advantage of staying in one of the hotels nearby, we stayed at the Hilton Tokyo Bay). The food will almost certainly be infinitely better, cheaper and it will be a much more relaxing experience! Oh, and if you're a Little Mermaid fan and wonder why there's no sign of Ariel, she's next door at Disneysea where she has her very own kingdom ;-)"
1792,5,16-Apr,Australia,We went after 6pm,"We have been here a few times, so we decided to go after 6 pm to see the night shows. I was a little disappointed as the firework display was cancelled due to the wind. At night it is easier to get on the rides. We had a very enjoyable evening as it wasn't so crowded."
1793,5,16-Apr,N/A,Totally PERFECT ,"My kiddos totally excited to going disneyland. All the way is beautifull, the weather its nice. Cant describe disneyland tokyo, just PERFECT. Adult and kiddos are so happy. Our favourite games are Peter Pan & meet the buzz (toy story area). Although the noon its raining we still keep around and happy. Just buy some umbrella. We stop to hungry bear to eat. Its the best curry! At 7.30 pm they have night electrical parade, 8.30 pm in the cinderella castle have a magical show. Fantastic thanks for the great experience.."
1794,4,16-Apr,Indonesia,Almost the same as Anaheim's,"We visited on Tuesday right after spring break was over so it was not so crowded. In fact almost no line to any of the rides.Going at 10 am was perfect no line at the entrance, went straight to the fast lane and get a few pass lane. Food line was quite crowded when we had breakfast and lunch. Dinner at Hokusai Japanese Restaurant at Disneyland, food was great price ¬•2,000 (US $18) per menu/person. Halal food same menu is available, tell the manager and he will ask the kitchen. "
1795,5,16-Apr,N/A,The best Disneyland ,Was an awesome experience. We were there an hour before the gates opened and just walked up to the counter and bought our ticket straight away. Did all the major rides with hardly any waiting time. Of course after lunch it started to get packed and waited maybe an hour for a ride. Food was so-so but the ambiance was amaZing! I would definitely go again and this time with my son! 
1796,4,16-Apr,Singapore,Tokyo Disneyland ,"We visited Tokyo Disneyland in April. It is a nice Disneyland but is very crowded. We reach the gates at around 9 am in the morning and have to queue up for 30minutes to get in. Would recommend that you reach there very early in the morning. The rides are pretty good. Disneyland and Disneysea has a fast pass system where you could get these passes so that you beat the queue. Recommend that you plan which rides that you want to take and get these fast pass as early as possible. Typical by afternoon, the fast pass are all gone.In our visit in April, we had to queue for around 30-45 minutes for the normal rides.   The visitors ( mainly Japanese ) are all very nice & pleasant people.  So even though we had to wait, the experience is not too bad after all. "
1797,3,15-Dec,Japan,Disneyland Tokyo just nice,Place is very big. Kids will love all the rides and everything there.The crowds were crazy. I prefer Disneysea Tokyo :D
1798,5,16-Apr,N/A,Wonderful,"We visited over two days in April (18th April and 20th April). We bought tickets online and went straight to counter to get in. Lines were not that long. We got on about 14 rides in a day, average wait time 20 mins. Do busy rides first and use fast pass. Found Monsters Inc ride very jerky. If you have a sensitive back maybe avoid. "
1799,5,16-Apr,Taiwan,A wonderland for all aged!,"You can have a lovely and wonderful daydream there!Just by going there, you can forget the reality and sadness for a while!and they did lots of efforts to make the shows, the parades and the facilities very perfect! i really had the perfect day there!"
1800,5,15-May,Bahrain,Three years in a row at Christmas time.,"We love this park.  We had a blast in 2012, 2013, 2014 and would love to go back again.  It's a little hard to do with multiple babies but it's doable.  Even if you don't speak Japanese you will have fun here.  Just keep an open mind and have fun.  You may feel out of place if you don't wear a Disney themed hat or something.  Everyone gets dressed up here.    "
1801,5,16-Apr,Australia,Happiest Place on Planet Earth,"Wow where do i start, i'm getting excited thinking about Disneyland.Firstly this place is not just for kids, it's for anyone who still likes to have fun laugh and enjoy life.The happiest place i have ever been to everyone is happy, everyone is laughing, everyone is enjoying themselves. Now your visit to Disneyland starts before you leave your house, do your homework, read reviews and PLAN. It was just my wife and myself so our plan was we are to old for rides so do we want a day pass or a two day pass? Day pass was our decision.We think we saw everything in a whole day, got there shortly after the crowds got thru the gates so no queuing, yet. There are queues for everything eating, rides, toilets, information desk, patience required in abundance. Once we had our map we planned which way we would go and where to stand to view parade (important otherwise you end up 10 deep). There are rules on how close you get to the front to watch a parade, sitting down in front standing at the back very organised.We had lunch we had snacks we did everything we could in a day except go on the rides. We stayed for the fireworks (weather dependent) we were lucky, saw the night castle show.There is happy music and songs playing the whole time even though we were so tired we were to happy and having fun to complain about it.The shops have every conceivable souvenir imaginable of every Disney character you have ever known. Very easy to blow the budget here especially when have family back home let alone what we loved to buy for ourselves.It's awesome fun you have to visit Disneyland, if you do plan to visit Tuesday to Thursday are 3 of the quietest days (i didn't think so) we went on a Thursday and it was claimed it was at 60% of what it could be? If you have children minimum two days, we had lunch with a couple with 2 children and they had a three day pass.Lots of people using fast passes for the rides, there is also standby (don't know how that works) anyways just plan, plan, before you leave home.It's a FUN PLACE."
1802,5,16-Apr,N/A,Disney electrical parade is awesome!,"I visited Tokyo Disneyland a week ago (April 2016), with two children  (9 yo and 4 yo). We had so much fun, the weather is prefect and the crowd is fine. We waited only around 30 min for favorite rides, e.g. Big Mountain roller coaster. Evening show such as electrical parade and Cinderella show is spectacular, leaving us with everlasting memories, specially for the kids. One of the highlight: I lost my purse, containing 4 Passports and cash money, somewhere in the restaurant, sometime after lunch. I realized around 7pm at night, I rushed to Lost and Found office and thanks God, it is found there, save and sound! Thumbs up for the Disneyland management!"
1803,5,16-Apr,N/A,Best Disneyland,"My children were thrilled with the endless scene of the places. Many shade area, plenty of  eating choices. They also set a fast track system to provide a random quicker queue. So you have to get this fast tickets first and then back there exactly at the pointed scheduled showed on the tickets. It save your time. Try to avoid visiting in the holidays season. You have to provide at least one day to complete half of this park. Love it"
1804,5,16-Apr,N/A,Great if you know what to do!,"Both Tokyo Disneyland & Disneysea are notorious for their insanely long lines on both ""quiet"" and busy days, sometimes reaching over 4 hours to get on a 30 second ride. This year we decided to do a bit of research and it made the world of difference! So here are a few tips to make your time at one of the Disney parks a lot more fun and how to avoid only making 1 or 2 rides because the lines are just too long.1. Check the Tokyo Disney crowd calendar, green days are apparently quiet days, but I can assure you they're still busy. I wouldn't bother trying to go on a yellow day and especially not a red unless you really enjoy lines. 2. Aim to go on a green day that is forecast to be cloudy with a chance of rain in the afternoon 3. Buy your ticket the day before from the Disney store in Shibuya. This will save you lots of time in the morning lining up to buy a ticket and also means you can go straight to one of the shorter lines at the gates4. Arrive early!!! I recommend arriving 45 - 60 minutes before it opens (crazy I know), there'll already be quite a few people lining up5. Once you get let in at 9am (Mon - Thurs) very quickly walk to a ride you want to go on and get a Fastpass for it, then move on to the next ride you want to go on and go standby.This should set you up nicely for the fastpasses and allow you to get in a few shortish sandby lines. If you do/time it right, you should be able to get on most of the rides!FASTPASS- You scan your entry ticket at the fastpass machine which is usually beside the ride and are given another ticket with an hour time slot for you to come back and skip the big line via the fastpass lane- You can only get 1 fastpass per hour from when you got your fist one, so its good to time it so you can go and get another as soon as your ticket allows you to I also recommend downloading the Tokyo Disney App as it tells you all of the wait times for rides, has a map with all the attractions pinpointed as well as show times!If you make sure to get there early (on a quiet day) and take advantage of the fastpass system you should have a great day and easily experience most of the rides!!"
1805,4,16-Apr,India,All about the merchandise,This place is not too big but the merchandise are attractive and affordable. My daughter and i enjoy shopping for disney items. The rides are not much but the merchandise are fabulous. Best disney buys for us
1806,4,16-Apr,United States,Where an adult can be a kid,"Disneyland Tokyo is just like Disney in the states, except for the language barrier. The lines are long, but that's expected. I did find that there were a limited number of restaurants that offered table service. Be sure to check out the restaurants that require reservations otherwise you are not getting served. Also search ahead for tickets at a discount instead of buying them at the resort. I saw a flyer at the 7-11 in Tokyo that offered tickets about 1000¬• less than the resort."
1807,5,15-Jul,Australia,Amazing ,Really cool to goto... lots of fun and things to do...was a group of 11 friends and we felt like kiddies again haha great times!!
1808,5,15-Sep,South Korea,Awesome fun overload,"Its Disneyland! Packed with all time favorite Disney characters, magical place! You need to queue up for a long time for all rides."
1809,5,16-Apr,N/A,Visit on wednesday and make the most out of the free fastpass,"Top attractions:Pooh's Hunny HuntPeter Pan's FlightThunder MountainSplash MountainSpace Mountain Light paradeTop foods:Chocolate milk popcorn (every place sells a different taste)Top photo spots:Swiss Family TrerHouseTom Sawyer RaftsPrefer the Monster Inc. Ride and seek to the Buzz Lightyear's Astro blaster (they are very similar, both with a long queue)"
1810,5,16-Apr,N/A,Wonderful Play,"Somewhat boring I thought before the trip, but I was wrong. The atmosphere was so joyful and the Disney members were so friendly. I always could find interesting activities for mild children. Do not miss the shows and the parades. The night show was fascinating but was too late for young children. However, there was still many people even in the light season. It was blessing there were so many Disney members to make everything alright, including the strollers."
1811,5,16-Apr,New Zealand,Perfect time of year,"Had a fantastic time at Tokyo Disneyland. Got a three day pass for our family of four which is more than enough to experience all the rides. Fast Pass system works great, although popular rides sell quick so have a strategy. Lovely weather this time of year and not very crowded."
1812,5,16-Apr,Australia,Fantastic!!,"We had such a great time with my 6 and 8 year olds. We went on a total of 18 rides in one single day, including 3 times on Star Tours which my 6 year old loved! The crowds were not bad when we went and we never queued for more than 15 mins for any ride. Mind you, I did check the Tokyo Disney anticipated crowd calendar prior to booking to ensure we were there on a relatively low activity day.  Monsters Inc was a bit lame and not worth it in my opinion. The buzz lightyear ride was much more interactive and worth the Fastpass. We ate Queen of hearts banquet hall for lunch and Crystal palace buffet for dinner (you need a booking). Food was good and plentiful. The electric parade to finish the day was spectacular. No fireworks on the night we went. The weather was fine and there was no wind. We reckon they just cancel it at whim to save money when the crowds are not big."
1813,5,15-Oct,Australia,Great place to propose,I will remember my visit to Tokyo Disneyland forever I proposed in front of the Castle at night time on Halloween.
1814,5,16-Apr,Philippines,A dream come true,"it is like a dream come true, everytime I go to disneyland. I have visited Hong kong disneyland and florida disneyworld. but I still want to keep on going back to disney."
1815,5,15-May,N/A,Child haven and for the young at hearts..,"I been in Tokyo last 2006.Its really nostalgic to remember this..Enjoy the places,its a child haven and adults who is young at heart. Visits the Cinderella Castle its so beautiful and enchanted..but since its always crowded you have to go early and get ready to have your reservation tickets to not waste time on long queue..."
1816,5,16-Apr,Canada,"Totally different culture, definitely a must go for foreigners!!","There's already a lot of reviews on Disneyland but I still want to share my recent experience, which was simply incredible. I've never been to Disneyland in my life, so I was definitely excited. It definitely showed me the magic of Disney.Firstly it is clean, the park is just spotless, everything seems wiped clean, the garden was tidy. The culture in Disney Japan is definitely different from anywhere else in the world. The teenage visitors are so immersed in the Disney culture, they all dress up to come to Disneyland. They would match accessories, Minnie Mouse ears, bowties, and even their whole outfit, to be all Minnies or donald, or same uniform but different ties. They're so proud of it and the way that everyone is wearing clothes that stand out, it makes you feel, ""hey, no one will judge even if I wear that giant mickey hat!"" And that is great, it's something that takes the experience to the next level.The rides were good, although a lot of lining up, if you have a limited time frame, definitely worth getting the fastpass, it'll be a regret if you don't get to all the rides in time. There's also a lot of souvenir stores to look through, to a point where I just felt like I was walking through a giant Disney Store. The parade was amazing, the daytime one and frozen parade were exciting, it's like they're telling a story with the parade. The night time one was just simply incredible, it was just amazing and great to watch. Especially love the monsters Inc part. Unfortunately there's no fireworks that night due to weather condition, but the story telling on the castle was just fantastic. We were near the entrance of the park, very far away from the castle, but we can still see clearly the story telling, the light show, and hear properly.The one thing that was great was how orderly the whole crowd was. The parade road would start being roped off an hour beforehand and people were laying out their matts and sitting and waiting. There's no push, everyone gets to sit properly, no one tries to stand and overlook. It almost felt like I was sitting down at a picnic watching the show. Made it a great atmosphere where I can truly enjoy Disneyland. You may bring water and other drinks in, I had no problem getting my apple juice in after the security check. Also, the burger and fries there are well done, it's cheaper than the restaurants, but it tasted great, had a nice mickey shaped bun too."
1817,5,16-Apr,United States,Truely Magical!!,"Being a Disney World Annual Pass Holder I loved that the ""magic"" transcended geographical and cultural boundaries. It was so much fun trying all the different flavored popcorn, listening to Mickey speak in Japanese and enjoying all the different kinds of desserts. We made sure to experience all that is unique to Tokyo Disney."
1818,5,16-Apr,Sweden,Great experience !,"Disney land is truly clean and beautiful! I was impressed with how everything was organized and built! What a great place , highly recommendedb"
1819,5,16-Mar,Australia,Sooooo clean,We had a great day at Disneyland. Not as large as the one in California but big enough to spend all day. The lines are long and it is worth planning your day with the fast pass. Must try the White chocolate churros.
1820,3,16-Apr,Australia,Not good,My husband and I recently went to Tokyo Disney on a weekday - we were there very early and it was absolutely packed. The wait for all the big rides was 4 1/2 hrs it was a 2hr wait for tea cups. We literally walked in and walked straight back out. I asked for a refund which the staff happily provided to us. I felt really bad for the other tourists that had children with them because you can't just leave when you have kids!!
1821,5,16-Apr,Philippines,Truly the happiest place! ,"Tokyo Disneyland exceeded my expectations for a Disney theme park... The staff are so pleasant, they are after our comfort. Though we cannot understand and did not watch some shows because they are in Japanese (we understand that this park is for the Japanese people) we still had fun.. Don't come here during Saturdays, they are really really full during weekends...I will still come back with my family, besides we have heard the English version of most shows.."
1822,5,15-Dec,India,Amazing trip filled with loads of fun..,We had an amazing day with our 4 year old..he was truly stunned to see his favorite mickey mouse live..we were able to get good vegetarian pizzas as well..
1823,2,16-Apr,Australia,Waste of a day,"We were full of excitement for Tokyo Disneyland - we love our theme parks and have been to the other Disneylands.This one was ridiculous though - so many people it was almost impossible to move, even in the big open spaces, the rides were all min 2 hour wait and the FastPasses all gone by the time we got there. Even the food stalls ad shows had crazy queues. What's interesting was the website shows that today was only a moderately busy day, apparently it gets MUCH worse.Managed to get on about 3 rides throughout the day, before giving up and heading back into Tokyo.Wouldn't bother wasting a day here when in this amazing city."
1824,4,16-Apr,Australia,A magical place!,"We had a full and fun day at Disney. Hard as many of the shows were in Japanese so we lost a lot of the meaning but still enjoyed. Like the Fastpass-wish we had known about that earlier. Lines to the main rides were very long and up to 3 hours so we didn't get to enjoy as much as we would have liked. Disappointed with the lottery system for the shows too. Surely, international visitors would get access to these shows while Japanese residents can return any time. That wasn't a good experience and showed poor thought/service. Loved the Disney lights; wonderland. Definitely would like to return one day and stay at the resort to get more of an experience."
1825,5,15-Dec,Malaysia,Best Disneyland in Asia !!,"I bought e-ticket 3 days Magic Pass, first and second days only can choose one Park (Disneyland or DisneySea), The 3rd days you can go both park,Too bad the Disney Resort Rail Line (Train) is not free of charge but lucky I stay 2 night in Tokyo Disneyland Resort, so I get 3 days pass for the Disney Line,Don't visit during weekend !!! U can't any fast pass after an hours of the opening, even you wanna have lunch or dinner you have wait more then an hours !!! For the baby toilet in Disneyland is very convenient but so far in DisneySea only have one nearby entrance, the baby toilet you can buy baby food, milks and pampers so is very convenient,Must try Japanese food in both Park !! Each park only have one Japanese Restaurant, the price quiet expensive ~ but the food is good,"
1826,4,16-Apr,United Kingdom,Great fun,I was dreading coming here. I thought it would be massively crowded and we would spend all our time waiting to get on rides. It was busy but very well run and so with a bit of planning you can do a huge amount. A couple of important tips to get the most out of your day.1) All tickets allow you to get fast passes without paying. You can claim 1 fast pass every 2 hours. So as soon as you get in get your fast pass for the busy rides and then do the same every 2 hours. By about 2 or 3 there are no more fast passes left so make the most of them. To claim a fast pass just go the machines and scan the bar code on you ticket.2) The restaurants have massive waiting times. Reserve seats in advance to avoid having to wait for an hour to eat. The Lilo and Stitch Hawaian restaurant was really good for the young kids

1828,4,16-Apr,Singapore,Good fun for the kids,"We got a 3 day pass, which allowed us to visit one park on the first day, the other park on the second, and either or both parks on the third. The park was packed with locals even on weekdays, so sadly we didn't get to enjoy most of the rides since the queuing time was crazy. They have a fast pass system that allow you to get priority tickets for a certain period of time. So with some careful planning, one can get to try the more popular rides in the park. There are 2 shows at night, starting from around 8pm. One light show that is projected onto the Disney castle, and a fireworks show. Do stay behind after the first show so that you won't miss the second one. There are also the parades by Disney characters throughout the day. Even the shops an restaurants are packed with people. Prices are quite decent and not too expensive. The souvenirs and food items are really to die for. Packaging is all so nice and makes you want to buy everything.  "
1829,5,15-May,United States,Best Disneyland in Asia,"Although some reviewers think that the Japanese language in all rides and amusements is a disadvantage, our girls found it intriguing. We've been trying to learn Japanese words before leaving and they were so excited when we were greeted by the Frozen parade with Anna and Elsa saying Konnichiwa!!! And we were able to watch this parade in the entire day we were there. Check out their website for schedules as planning ahead allows you to accomplish more within the park.A disneyland will also be crowded and the long lines are a given but the cool climate makes the wait pleasant. I highly recommend!"
1830,4,16-Apr,Australia,Had a great but long day,"We only had a day to devote to Disneyland. Managed to do all that we wanted and were lucky that it wasnt too crowded. The longest line we were in was around 30 minutes (advertised as 50 minutes), we found the actual wait was around one-half to two-thirds the advertised time. We only used one fastpass, but avoided the most popular rollercoasters as our young daughter wasnt interested. The staff were friendly and helpful but hefood was typical of all parks - overpriced and ordinary. All and all we had a lovely day."
1831,5,15-Jul,Taiwan,Have fun,"There is a heaven for children.I have been there when I was 19 years old.I went there with my mom,and I remembered the Disney gave me a dreaming impression.And there's slogan is ""Dream come true"",so come to the Disney is the best choice for family trip."
1832,1,16-Mar,Netherlands,Ones upon a long waiting time...,"this was actually the last Disney park i still needed to visit, worldwide. It wasn't a succes. Waiting lines exceeded 4 hours (!) for all major rides. Smaller rides had lines of 1 1/2 hours and more."
1833,3,16-Apr,United Kingdom,Not as exciting as Disneyland Paris.,"This park is primarily for Japanese rather than foreign visitors.  We were able to pay for and print our tickets before we left for our holiday and so we joined the correct queue at 7:45 and just before 8:30 we were in the park.  With the ticket you can obtain a fast pass for free but do read the small print on the bottom as to when you can get your next fast pass, some say not before 15 minutes before the start time of your fp ticket, others are for later.  You are doing well if you get 3 fast pass tickets in a day.  Also some of the rides close the lines to any more queuing at lunchtime due to the high levels of people visiting. There's not enough restaurants and we queued up for a considerable time for them too. We also queued for 20minutes for popcorn, I have never queued up so much!  As for the rides, space mountain here is tamer than Paris, the buzz lightyear is the same, Haunted house is a little different and I think less scary here. The star tours (star wars tour) is in Japanese.   We went on Peter pan s flight, small world and snow white which were nice but not special or exciting.  Overall the park felt dated and aimed at young children.  There's too much emphasis on the merchandise and the shopping for Disney souvenirs.  I spent the day here, the afternoon dragged but the electric parade at 7:30 was lovely, but I am happy to not have to Disneyland again."
1834,3,16-Mar,Malaysia,Too crowded,"Went there end of March, too many people in the park. Long queues everywhere. I would suggest visiting during non peak season. I was quite disappointed with the cancellation of fireworks at night due to windy weather. Staff at the restaurant was overwhelmed and rude too. In general I find Paris Disneyland or Hong Kong Disneyland are better than this."
1835,4,16-Apr,Spain,"If you plan in advance, it van be an awesome day! ","I'm not a Disney fan. I like theme parks, but Disney just not my thing. Taking this into account, saving that Disney Tokyo was a great experience has even more value. We spent the whole day there (advise 1, go 1 hour before they open), and we enjoyed 19 rides... It was just a great day! But you need to plan in advance. Take into consideration that people there LOVES Disney, so you could end up waiting 4 hours to try that fancy ride everyone likes. So, first thing before visiting... Plan your fast passes. Fast passes are something very smart that only this park has, and allows you to avoid some queues if you have an strategy. For me the 2 most important rides are Space Mountain and the Winnie the Pooh one. Run to space mountain to get the fast pass there and then go straight to Winnie's :) Another tip! Food is not expensive here, so don't bother bringing good from outside because it's better to forget about bags and all this... Just enjoy the rides! "
1836,5,15-Nov,Australia,Utter Perfection,"It's of course the best place on earth! I don't know what more to say other than it was spotless, the park was clean everyday we went! The staff are unbelievably kind and helpful, I was amazed! The lines can take up to 2-3 hrs if they are super busy, but if you are a regular goer to theme parks then you understand this and you can always grab a fast pass if you have the time and plan your trip right. "
1837,5,16-Apr,United States,Fun time!,"Spent an afternoon enjoying the sights and the rides. Clean park, very friendly staff. Easy to get around."
1838,2,15-Jun,Singapore,Am a sucker for theme parks but Disneyland failed me,"I think it is very easy to be enamoured by the idea of Disney and how it is the land of magical wonders and characters that come to life etc. I think the food there is sub par and overpriced. The rides are overhyped and boring. After a full day at Disneyland, I was honestly not impressed at all and wished there was more than one ride (the space mountain) that gave me some adrenalin whilst riding the ride. Aside from all of that, the aesthetic appeal of the whole Disneyland did make me reminisce about all my childhood movies and memories. The iconic Disney castle that lit up so magically in the evening and outlined the night sky also the soft lights that lined the bushes on the pavements made the whole theme park extremely beautiful."
1839,2,16-Apr,Australia,Too busy to enjoy,So busy it was ridiculous! Frozen was a non event much to the dismay of my 3 year old...Would not bother going again
1840,4,16-Apr,Australia,Good but expensive ,"We arrived here late evening from a trip out of Tokyo. The good thing park is open till 10pm so you can find things to play until last minutes. If you don't speak Japanese, most staffs can speak English, but unfortunately attractions like theatres/show types are always in Japanese (no English subtitles) so best to stick to action based attractions."
1841,3,16-Mar,Australia,Soooooo busy!,"We stupidly went in the Japanese school holidays so the queues were 5-and-a-half hours long for most rides and the fast passes were mostly gone when we arrived at 10 am. They had also shut the park to people who had not pre-purchased a ticket, thankfully (or not) we had! The best time to get there was 8 am, opening time. We did go on one ride, Star Tours which was good and saw a show and the Disney Parade so the kids were happy."
1842,3,16-Mar,United States,Crowded place in Spring,"We visited in late March. Thankfully, we had purchased our day passes in advance, since the park was sold out by 9:30am. Apparently this happens quite often, so do not assume that you can get in just by showing up. The park was extremely crowded. Wait times for popular rides were 3-4 hours long and fast passes for most rides were closed by 11am. The lines just for popcorn and drinks were 30 minutes long. Spending all day at the park we were able to go on about 3 rides- Space Mountain, Small World and Peter Pan. The park itself is identical to California Disneyland and we found virtually no merchandise (shirts, etc) which even indicated that we were at the Tokyo park. Somewhat disappointing. We thought it would be novel to attend, but in retrospect, would not recommend."
1843,2,16-Apr,Australia,Appalling Drainage Design When Raining,"Yes as you know rain is not rare in Tokyo.  Yet when it rains at Disneyland the drainage is appalling, in fact it's non-existent. Everyone has rain jackets and umbrellas, and if you don't, Mr Disney will sell you some. However kids having to walk through a centimetre or two of water which simply sits on the ground can turn your day into a damp, wet feet disaster.  We saw a couple of staff in the entire park attempting to clear water away, with little success, but put simply, the majority of the park is a flawed drainage design.  The rides are good, and the staff are very helpful and pleasant, but if it's raining, either think again, or bring rubber boots for the kids and several pairs of socks. "
1844,5,15-Dec,Singapore,Truly the Happiest Place on Earth,We went around 3pm so lines were gone. We went there specifically for the Dream Lights Parade and the fireworks since previous reviewers said it was one of the park's highlights. We agree. The kids were in awe at the lights and the characters. We have seen the parade during the morning (in HK and LA) so this was definitely something new.  Make sure you start lining up along the roads atleast 30 minutes before the parade starts to get a good spot.
1845,5,16-Mar,United Kingdom,Fantastic!,"We had a brilliant time at Disneyland. Generally it was amazing.The language barrier was a problem at times as the staff couldn't always help and often didn't know times of character greetings etc. Also, the Japanese communicate no by holding up their arms in an X shape which comes across as quite aggressive which was uncomfortable to see (something to be aware of if travelling with young children!) Other than that, it was great, really great!"
1846,5,16-Apr,Japan,Go Off Season,"This was actually my third visit to Tokyo Disney Land...something I didn't realize; though the park is *mostly* the same, there are some differences...No Matterhorn ride, and Mr. Toads Wild Ride is replaced by a similar Roger Rabbit Ride, as those were two of my favorite rides from my childhood growing up near Disney Land in Anaheim Ca., I just thought I'd mention that.Make sure you are well-aware of Japanese holidays and public school scheduled...to avoid them! Japan is a crowded place, but like every else gets more crowded over spring-break and summer vacation!Advice: Food can be expense and lines long...plan ahead and leave something in backpack in a coin locker outside the park (inside the park they will be full). You can get a reentry stamp to get back in. Buy your tickets online and get the 2-day passport for Tokyo Disney Sea and Tokyo Disney Land, this will save you a ton of money if you are going to go to both. Disney Land does take American Express, VISA, and MC, but you will want some cash for food. Buy your souvenirs on the way out of the park, and plan on getting a foot massage afterwards!One interesting note.  I took my family over Spring Break in Japan, and the local JHS and HS girls tend to all dress the same and travel in groups.  It was really cute and the loved it when westerners took pictures with them!  It makes for some fun memories."
1847,5,16-Mar,Malaysia,Thank You to Lost And Found Department,"On 19th March 2016 ,   I and my family visit  Disneyland Tokyo , For the last hour before we need to left Disneyland to take the bus to Airport , I notice one of my quite expensive umbrella is missing . So we straight  go to Lost and found department to check weather they found my umbrella . Unfortunately they didn't have my umbrella with them . On 22nd March 2016 , I received a call all the way from Disneyland Japan saying that the y manage to found my umbrella, Wow I'm shock , to the extend they will courier it to me FOC , 29th March 2016 , the parcel arrived safely .... I can't believed it Japanese people and Disneyland Staff are go genuine ans sincere .Thank You Disnesland  Lost and Found Department"
1848,4,16-Apr,United States,Great for Disney fans,"This park is set up very similar to Magic Kingdom in Orlando having replicas of the different areas (fantasy land etc.) and rides.  The park is pretty large and has a very nice main street area in the beginning which is covered and very large (shops and food).  Overall, the food was very good and reasonably priced including snacks and sit down meals.  There is a subculture of popcorn (and the popcorn buckets) as there are various stands with unique flavors (including honey, curry, soy sauce and butter) and a lot of people purchase a popcorn bucket that hangs around your neck so you can snack as you walk and wait in line.  The Winnie the Pooh ride which was unique (in terms of Orlando) was very fun and visually impressive.  Most of the other rides were direct replicas but were humorous to see with Japanese spoken for the characters (Haunted Mansion, Splash Mountain, etc.).  My only true complaint would be the lines for most rides were long (including the popcorn) and the rides were short and contained in smaller buildings.  If you are a fan of Disney I would highly recommend just for the experience and the price is very moderate compared to the Orlando parks."
1849,3,16-Apr,Australia,Kids loved it but the wait lines are ridiculous ,We went in knowing the long waits for rides but they where ridiculous more than three hours for some of the popular rides. It made the day very long. Fast passes make a big difference. Plan your day out in advance and you will get on quite a few rides.Food was well priced and I didn't feel overcharged for anything whilst there.Be patient your day will be ok
1850,2,16-Apr,N/A,Waiting time for attractions was horrible,"We arrived at 10am and left at 9pm with two young kids, and nearly 80% of time either queuely at the attractions, for food,  using the restrooms, and walking around looking for things to do that do not take long queueing time.Overall, it was a disappointment for us."
1851,4,16-Mar,Indonesia,Different Disneyland Experience,"I have been to all Disneyland... Anaheim, Florida, Paris, HongKong and now Tokyo. I have been here once when i was young, 10 years old so i didn't remember anything. This is my 1st visit back as an adult. I went to Tokyo disneyland with my husband and 10 years old daughter. We just visited Anaheim Disneyland this summer so everything is fresh to us. Anaheim has more rides than this Disneyland. Maybe thats why the line are so long in  Tokyo Disneyland. Every ride, the line is 1-2 hours long. Even for food there is a very long line. We used fast pass but the fast pass ended early.  Some rides already out of fast pass by day time Thank goodness i just came back from Anaheim Disneyland so we are not very disappointed for not being able to ride a lot of rides. The unique thing about Tokyo Disneyland are the people that goes there. So many Japanese wearing cute costume or uniform. It is so good for people watching. Also the park is very clean. They also have weird flavour of popcorn... They have honey popcorn, cappuccino popcorn, and other weird flavour... so that was cool. Overall.. i have good experience.... Always love Disneyland..."
1852,3,16-Mar,Australia,A little disappointed,"Took my 3 teens to Tokyo Disneyland and spent 2 full days there - 1 day each in Disneyland and DisneySea.There's probably a few things Disneyland Tokyo could do to improve foreign tourists' experiences.  Firstly, improve the entry into the resort.  Not enough gates and their scanners don't work very well.  It took us 45 minutes to get through the entrance despite being there 20 minutes before the gates opened (8am).  Every queue was about 100m long 20 metres wide across. They could look no further than Universal Studio in Osaka where the entry was smooth and efficient with a small queue at opening times;Secondly, they need to improve their FastPass system.  A 2 hour wait for the next available FastPass does not make the cut considering the entry fee and the wait times for some of the rides.  The waiting time for the Flying Dinosaur ride was 500 minutes, which is absurd.  The average waiting time for a popular ride was between 150 to 180mins.  Maybe selling the FastPass and restrict the number of FastPass a day for the rides could be a solution.  Again - look no further than Universal Studios;Thirdly, remember it's not just about Japanese visitors.  There are foreign tourists at the park.  It's not too difficult to have English subtitles (translations) for the rides to make the experience more enjoyable.Overall an enjoyable first time experience.  Would rather spend my money in US Disneyland next time."
1853,3,16-Mar,United States,Disney Disappointment,"There are 37 million people in Tokyo and it felt like every one of them went to Disneyland on Good Friday. The lines were huge and the Fastpass ended early.  We were only able to get one Fastpass. We watched as 12 people from the regular line were admitted to the Monsters, Inc. ride while 31 people from the Fastpass line went in. Perhaps that is a normal ratio but it was very frustrating after waiting for over 2 hours.  Lines were long for food and even the restrooms. My family loves Disney but I would not return to this park."
1854,2,16-Apr,United Kingdom,Disney rip off,Up to two hours wait for a ride this money making machine is best avoided. I felt sorry for the kids in the ridiculous queues.
1855,1,16-Apr,Australia,Don't bother!,"What a waste of time! Don't bother with Tokyo Disneyland or Disney Sea unless you want to stand in line between 2-4 hours we booked (two adults and one child) online before arriving in Japan. Firstly we were told we couldn't book on the Disney website without a Japanese credit card but we entered our details and it all went through ok. Our first day we were at Disneyland at about 9:15am and we ran to get our first fast pass that was scheduled at the earliest of 12:30pm. We couldn't get our next fast past for another two hours so we walked around for hours not being able to get on any rides as it was between a 2-4 hour wait! Ridiculous! Everything had a huge line, from the popcorn stands to the restaurants, small cafes absolutely anything had a 30-60 minute wait even a massive wait to have your own photo with a character. We went on one ride and left at about 2:30pm.Second day was worse! We got into Disneyland sea 30 mins early it was freezing cold and raining and this still didn't keep the crowds away! We wanted to get on one ride the tower of terror! When we arrived at the ride it was a 3 hour wait so we thought we would try Toy Story mania that was a four hour wait and at 9:45am in the morning all the fast passes were already given out so don't trust the fast pass tickets to save your day! We waited in line for about 20 mins for a popcorn bucket and went home! Unless you like crowds and want to wait hours and hours don't bother and if you are thinking it's all tourists you are wrong Disneyland in Japan is their local hangout for families and teens! If you are planning your trip around Disney land like we did you will be highly disappointed! If you want a great family holiday visit Singapore Universal studios you can buy a daily express pass for $50 and not have to wait for hours!"
1856,3,16-Mar,United States,Too many people - go to HK instead,"We just made the very huge mistake of going to Tokyo Disneyland over Japanese Spring Break. I live in China and still this the most people that I have experienced in one place ... lines were 3+ hours in many places - sometimes even the Fastpass ticket lines were 1+ hours!The park itself is just like Disney at any of the other parks (at least, we have been to Anaheim, FL and Hong Kong) and if you have young kids who like to go on rides instead of standing in long lines then I would suggest either spending most of your time at DisneySea (really fantastic experience) or skipping this all together.That being said, I would suggest a few tips to make your visit more tolerable:(1) Get to the park as early as possible. If you can get into the park before 9, you can get a Fastpass AND at least 1-2 rides during the first hour. We got to the park by 7:30 (8 am opening) every day and still had to wait ~30 min to actually get into the park.(2) Take the monorail in if you are at one of the partner hotels. They close a gate to the subway bridge/parking lots/walkway prior to opening so that the only people who can actually queue are those who ride the monorail. This saves a lot of time.(3) Relax and see the first parade at Tomorrowland caf√©. The parade route goes over a bridge right by the Tomorrowlad caf√© terrace. This means that you can sit in real chairs and have no one blocking your view! We got there at 10:00, grabbed a table outside, ate our food and then were able to see the 11 am parade - was a great break from the frustrations of the rest of the visit.Overall, we have to say that we were extremely disappointed with this Disney trip especially when they pride themselves on the customer experience."
1857,5,16-Mar,Malaysia,#NAME?,"- Great place to bring kids-Terrible place for some peace and quiet, the crowds are stifling, not a square inch of spare walking space- Meeting Mickey and taking pictures is a must!- Take a seat in Mickey's Philharmonic place, Great songs, a fantastic sensory experience!-Make sure you book the tickets first!We went at 10am and no tickets are available for those who didnt purchase"
1858,4,16-Mar,Netherlands,Rainy but still amazing,"Disneyland is always a heaven for me, but I must admit it was less fun as it has been raining heavily all day. First thing we did was to buy rain poncho's. Armed with rain poncho's, I was looking forward to my lunch. Have been looking all over the internet and was really excited for ""Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall"". + the atmosphere was amazing (Japanese don't joke around going to Disney, 99 out of a 100 Japanese are dressed as a princess or is wearing a Disney hat).+ they had all sorts of popcorn baskets (flying Olaf, big Mickey underpants etc) and popcorn in different flavours+ everybody stands in line to take pictures at certain places so nobody is standing in your picture+ the interior of ""Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall"" is absolutely stunning and worth going to Disneyland + we saw a lot of Disney figures walking around the park. With a little patience, you'll be able to get a picture with them.  Tips: - because of the rain we didn't see any parades - no fireworks- rain ain't fun- they hardly speak English - check if your hotel has a free Disney shuttle bus (Keio Plaza Hotel in Shinjuku did and brings you back straight to the hotel so no public transport is needed)"
1859,5,16-Mar,N/A,Magical place!,"A wonderful and magical theme park! Rides were awesome and staff there were friendly. Although not all of them can converse well in English, but they were all helpful when you approach them. The children enjoyed all the rides especially the Jungle cruise, Peter Pan's flight, Gadget's go coaster, Grand circuit raceway, StarJets and Monsters Inc Ride & Go Seek. The people who went there are all spontaneous and you will have lots of fun there. We will definitely be back again!!!"
1860,5,16-Mar,Indonesia,Vacation,"Huge, nice and so full of people during this month. Every attractions must wait approximately 140-160 minutes for the rides."
1861,5,15-Dec,N/A,Amazing,"It was so amazing to see our childhood favorite character in real... A lot of attracion you can ride, and so many thing to ride with your children as well."
1862,4,16-Mar,Philippines,Still the happiest place on earth,Disneyland Tokyo is a great place to bring the family. But watch out for the crowds. and I mean crowds!!! had a 150 minute wait at space mountain and 100 minutes at Haunted Mansion. Good thing we got a Fast pass for Space tour. hope they also install heaters outside specially for very chilly days :) But great Parade of Lights and still the happiest place on earth because I was with family :)
1863,4,16-Jan,United States,Fun for everyone!,"This Disney Land is similar to the Disney Land in America, but at the same time is still very unique. I went for New Years and got to participate in special New Years activities which was very cool. I would recommend going on New Years if possible. They had an amazing show located at Cinderella's castle which was unique to this Disney Land and was was of the neatest things I have ever seen. The only downside was the fireworks were cancelled because of potential wind, which was unfortunate. The rides are all in Japanese which makes it more fun in my opinion, but something to be aware of. I would absolutely recommend going here!"
1864,5,16-Mar,Australia,The Happiest Place on Earth! :),"It's Tokyo & Disneyland put together so as long as you're PREPARED for the ridiculous crowds you'll have the best day ever!!Prepare: Take food from home to avoid the long lines(7/11 is great for this). Research the rides you'd like to do, which ones have the fast pass system(research this and use it to your advantage). Download/print a map before your trip & know where things are. Know a little bit of Japanese to help you on the day, hello, thank you, excuse me etcWe arrived into the train station a little after 7am and it was already packed. You stand in a line to get your bag checked and then another to go in the gate. We were in the park by 8.15am. Definitely recommend arriving at least an hour before opening!Most of the day you'll be in one type of a line or another, don't let it get to you, get the map out & plan things to do later, play 20 questions about Disney characters, just look around & be happy that you're in Disneyland!!The parades are definitely a highlight! We ended up being able to do 8 rides throughout the day plus parades, shopping and food breaks! If you're prepared you'll enjoy all the craziest even more :)"
1865,3,16-Mar,N/A,"Not so magical, just ok.","Tokyo Disneyland was supposed to be the place my partner and I went to experience the magic that is Disney from our childhood. Upon entering the park the whole ambiance is immediately breathtaking and quite exciting. Once being in the park for 15 minutes it becomes rapidly clear that Tokyo Disneyland is the place to go if you like standing in line for a lifetime. We waited on average 2-3 hours for rides, 45 minutes for food, and around 30 minutes to use a toilet. The park became incredibly cramped towards the middle of the day as to be expected. If you're happy to spend most of your day waiting in queues this is the place for you, if you're not, find another place to go. On a positive note the food was well priced and the staff were quite friendly. As a final note, the rides are all narrated in Japanese, it's important that you be a hardcore Disney fan if you want to know what's going on during the show."
1866,1,16-Mar,Australia,Don't waste your hard earned $$ here.,Disneyland the place that's meant to make you happy made us feel quite the opposite after being inside for 5 minutes. In the first 5 hours we were there was successful in getting on one ride. We were unable to get Fastpass to rides as they were all given out. Whats annoying is that it appeared that most of those with the Fastpass were locals. There is absolutely no priority of sorts for visiting tourists which is very unfortunate. Should have saved the ¬•6900 each ticket that we pre-purchased as well and gone to the Gold Coast in Australia where for a few more thousand Yen I could have got a multi pass and visited 3 theme parks and been happy! We left out going to Mt Fuji for Disneyland because it's Disneyland!!!! Should have gone to Mt Fuji least I'd have been happier and also saved money in the process.
1867,1,16-Mar,Australia,"Far too many people, 4 hour queues. ","We visited on a Tuesday during the Japanese School Holidays and we had prepaid our tickets. We arrived at 9.15am at the park entrance and they already suspended direct ticket sales for the day because of the high number of visitors; only people with prepaid tickets were allowed in. It took almost 1 hour to get through the gate (ticket and bag inspection). They had some Disney characters just after the entrance gate but getting a photo with them was utterly impossible because they were constantly surrounded by at least 20-30 people each. Inside the park the attractions had queues with signs ""waiting time from this point x minutes"". The longest one we found was 220 minutes, almost 4 hours - and people were still happily queuing up for it!? We went with our 6 and 11 year old kids who were both very disappointed -we didn't end up going on any ride and even the queues for the food were all in excess of 50 meters long - couldn't even get any popcorn. The fast passes also only allocated time slots for late in the evening, what a farce.Park management simply allowed the park to be filled far beyond capacity and hence made it unusable for pretty much everybody.This was a big disappointment and an utter waste of money.It still was quite an experience to see such a large crowd in good spirits despite the shortcomings of the park, the Japanese must be the most patient and friendly people on the planet. If you happen to want to go during Japanese school holidays I would recommend you make other plans."
1868,2,16-Mar,Australia,Not the happiest place on Earth :( ,"What a disappointment. In a group of 4 aged 24, we were hoping Disneyland would allow us to experience our childhood once again. That didn't happen.At a place that would draw the attraction of tourists, we were disappointed that there were limited staff who could speak English to help us understand where things were or how a certain Japanese system works (e.g. Fast Pass system). We ended up getting a Fast Pass for Space Mountain and were all shocked when we realised we had to wait 6 hours (no joke) to actually use it! If that wasn't bad enough, we had to wait no less than 180 mins (yep, 3 hours) for every ride. So from 10.30am when we got our tickets until 10pm when the show ended, we rode a total of 3 rides (Space Mountain twice with the fast pass). Such a complete waste of a day!The only positive was the decently priced food. Although we can't forget about the half filled chips and rude staff. If you can avoid Tokyo Disneyland, I would. "
1869,4,16-Mar,Denmark,Nice and clean,"My family had 2 great days at disneyland in Tokyo. The place is very clean and prices are very reasonable, also for dining."
1870,2,16-Mar,Singapore,Disneyland Tokyo,Place is very big. Kids will love all the rides and everything there. Mascots and all were cute. However not for impatient adults who are not willing to queue for 60mins... Express pass is not express but just a confirm time ride for you üò•
1871,5,15-Apr,Philippines,Happiest place on earth,Tokyo disneyland is so far the best theme park I have been to. It would have been perfect if there were English translations but nonetheless the rides and attractions were awesome. 
1872,3,15-Apr,Australia,Disneyland Tokyo,"Two Parks all Split up,You need at least 2 Days at 1 or 1 Day if on a Budget which I was same theme as America,Only Disappointment in a Non Speaking English place,Iam not saying that everyone can""t speak English , Most of there Fun Rides which are the same in America,Are in there Native Language (Japanese),Its Funny at First,But after its Not,4d Films again ,not in English,Indiana Jones Ride ,Again,no English speaking as you Travel Through the RideJapan is Still a Beautiful Country And Lots to See,But if Amusements are  on .you list,Beware ,Still has the same Crowds Disney Brings,Iam Yet too Check Paris Disney"
1873,5,16-Mar,Singapore,Fun park for the whole family!,Many ppl know these Disney is old But!!!!!! It still fun!First: well organized ( thanks to Japanese culture)Second: many different theme with mixture of games for kids and adult Third: good for shoppingForth: the shows are extremely great! The performance really take care of everyone. They will stop for all angle for audience to take picture. Fifth: the rides are great for children. My son every dream of the ride after a long day in Disneyland!!!
1874,3,16-Mar,United States,One word...CROWDED,"Very easy to get to with the subway and rail system.  Is was very interesting that there is NO ADVERTISING of Disneyland anywhere in Tokyo (at least that I saw).  It was on a Friday and I think everyone on the planet was there.  1 1/2 hour wait for almost all attractions.  For those using ""fast-track""...you signed in and came back about 4 hours later!  Unless you HAVE TO GO, I would pass.  One nice thing...it's cheap, 6900 yen ($61.00)"
1875,5,16-Mar,Malaysia,Super Fun if you not try to do too much!,"We had 3 kids in tow below 5 so we didnt try to do too much. Having a laid back approach helps as the queues were INSANE!!! The crowds were crazy. We were there on a week day and i just could not imagine how the weekends would be. Set expectations right. Plan ahead but be fluid with your plans. Contigency- rains, kids need afternoon naps etc.Catch the parades. The night show at the castle was spectacular! A few tips.1. Plan ahead2.Target your rides in advance. Height restrictions etc3.Learn the fast pass system. 4. Download the TDR wait times app. (useful!)5. Just enjoy your time, have fun and dont get too stressed if you cant cover the whole park in 3 days :-) including Disney Sea."
1876,4,16-Mar,United Kingdom,Disney Magic,"It rained the whole day we were at this park but this didn't stop us from enjoying it. You have to still just go for it, I had hoped the rain might reduce crowd size but this was not the case. It was busy, but as per previous reviews I had expected this. We managed to ride most of the big rides we wanted in the morning with the exception of Space Mountain, by the time we got there all the fastpasses were gone so we queued for around 1.5hours to ride it. It wasn't so bad, it was under cover and the people around you are all friendly enough.Some of the parades were rained off but we saw my husbands favourite (Electrical Light Parade) which was as impressive as ever. For the parades you either get to sit in the first  row on a mat which you bring yourself or you stand behind. It is all very organised unlike in the American Parks."
1877,5,16-Mar,United States,Great time. Typical Disney experience,"Coming from the US I was pleased with the lower price of tickets, food and gifts at Tokyo Disney. But still the great Disney experience! We went with my daughter who is 3 and was free to get in the park!!! The parades are a must see. The park also has amazing popcorn throughout with different unique flavors, however long lines for all the food vendors are a slight deterrent.  We had lunch at the Alice in Wonderland themed restaurant which was also worth the time and wait. Overall a wonderful family day. "
1878,4,16-Mar,Canada,"Busy, busy, busy!","I brought my son the Tokyo Disneyland (1-day pass) and it was busy, busy, busy!  I think it was because of the Spring Break in Japan. I arrived around 9:15am and went to guest services to get a tour guide (3-hour guide shows you around the park and gets you into the rides with minimal to no waits) but they were all booked for the day!  Fast passes were all 'sold out' by 11am.My son and I got a fast pass for Space Mtn. and Star Tours but had to wait in line for the Tea Cups and Roger Rabbit (30-40min.).  We were there from about 9:15am to 3:15pm and those were the only ride we went on ... Line up for photos with characters were also long. Don't go during Spring Break if you can avoid it. "
1879,5,16-Mar,N/A,Always a magical time!,"This was my second trip to TDL.  I prefer TDS, but this is still a top notch park.  To make the most of your time,  get in early, get a fastpass and ride the popular rides before they get packed out.   And they will get packed out, the Japanese love their Disneyland!Chicken and Turkey legs always delicious, toilets always spotless, cast members always welcoming and friendly.  Get yourself some Mickey ears and have a great time!"
1880,5,15-Apr,Philippines,First Disney Land,I love the turkey leg! Its cold and its raining but they still offer cold drinks.. brrrRides are very friendly and safe
1881,3,16-Mar,Thailand,Fast Pass messed up everything,"From 10 in the morning till 8 at night, we rode 3 rides! It was a 200 minute wait and I kid you not for a ride on Splash Mountain. Fast pass were given in the morning and although we managed to only get for 1 ride, maybe it would have been only 2 rides through that one day!. we felt that it did not do justice to those waiting in standby queues.. We and some other people waiting in line did count that fast pass customers were let into rides at a ratio of almost 5:1. so if you are one of the ""stupid"" people not to queue early in the morning for fast passes for the evening rides, you probably are lucky  to get to ride 2 or 3 attractions through the whole day. It was packed the day we went and i am sure they did proper math in calculating the fast pass and regular visitors ratio, it didnt work the day we were there. something is clearly wrong. The ride that i was really looking forward to Pirates of the Carribean was closed. Haunted Mansion had a breakdown. Was a total raw deal and my children's first Disney visit turned out to be a really big let down. I would take them Anaheim Disney but never Tokyo disney again. I have to give the big ups on the park being spotless and staff were all amazing people. But thats more of a culture thing rather than anything to do with DIsney. Disappointing."
1882,4,16-Feb,N/A,Likeable for all age,I have been to a lot of places like Tokyo dome and other amusement park.But as everyone say Tokyo Disney land is the most fun part of the life.In other places the land is small so are the coasters. I noticed one thing that it offers you various rides and it's not only for children but old people can also go there and have fun.Its not for certain age only.This time I went with my friend but next time I will take my family with me.
1883,5,16-Mar,N/A,So much fun and very romantic at Disney sea,"I love this place! It's so different from other Disneylands and I think Disney sea is very romantic for adults. It's a very nice date place, especially with all the nautical theme all around you. People are also very respectful and everyone waits in lines. The lines are a bit longer, but I did not mind the wait. The weather is very nice in tokyo right now. Not too cold and not too warm. I think it was overall a very great experience!"
1884,3,16-Mar,United Kingdom,"Queues, queues, queues.","Being a Disney theme park fan and having been to all the Disneyland theme parks, this was the last one for us to visit. This was very busy considering it was mid March and was also raining a lot throughout the day. Thing that surprised us most was how long the queues were to every single ride -even the less popular rides were still at least a 20 minute line, with the most popular rides in excess of 2 hours! You really need to get there at its 8am opening time and stay until it's 10pm closing time to have any chance in getting on all the main rides. You just have to be very patient for the long waiting times in between getting the fast pass tickets. Very little English spoken but this actually appealed to us to experience the difference between parks in HK, Paris and USA. If however you only want to hear English then this is not the park for you. As with all Disney parks it's very colourful and the light parade is a fantastic sight to see. If they could somehow manage to reduce the queue lines to everything - toilets/restaurants/food kiosks (not just the rides), then this park would have received a higher rating. If you are a Disney fan like me however, it's a must visit place."
1885,2,16-Mar,Canada,Really? Waiting 120 minutes for a three minute ride?,"I have young children. I have been to Disney world Orlando on several occasions. If you have, no need to attend here... same rides, same layout and much worse waits in lines. Spent hours waiting in line for a three minute ride out of guilt for our kids. Got tires of waiting in line for food, washrooms, rides and non ride features. If you want to experience what late 80's Eastern Soviet Union was like when many waited in bread lines, then by all means go. But if you cannot rationalize waiting 120 minutes for a three minute anti climatic ride, on a weekday no less...then avoid and take your kids elsewhere... like a Yomiuri Giants game.. now that is value."
1886,5,15-Jun,Australia,Best day ever!,"I firmly believe that Tokyo would have to be the best place to go to Disneyland anywhere in the world. Firstly it is SPOTLESS. Not a crumb, not a cobweb, not a drip mark anywhere. You have to go to Japan to understand what clean really means. Secondly no pushing, no shoving, no queue jumping. That means that wait times for every ride are a very nice 15 minutes. That means that even a 4yo can wait patiently for that amount of time. Thirdly it is so safe. You can leave a stroller laden with family heirlooms anywhere you like and when you come out of a ride the stroller will have been neatly parked waiting for you at the exit of the ride by someone (I don't know who I never saw them - amazing!). Fourthly (is that even a word??) the Japanese are into it. I mean every man, woman and child dressed in head to toe Disney outfits, even cool groups of teenagers wearing matching costumes (only the Japanese could make that cool and not daggy). We stayed there all day and into the night. I never thought I would love it, so much but I did - we even ended up in an over-sized Minnie ribbon by lunchtime - us! Cynical Aussies! In my opinion four is the perfect age for a kid in Disneyland so if you have one go. You won't regret it. "
1887,3,16-Mar,Australia,Language,"Was pretty good I really like Disney.  Liked it a lot, but I didn't like how Japanese the place is.   The American Disneyland is more English"
1888,4,15-Oct,Australia,"Amazing time with friends,","Amazing time if your with friends, lots to see and doFood is really good tooFor older children/adults would recommend disney sea"
1889,3,16-Mar,Australia,Crowds crowds crowds,"Firstly the layout and features are great at Tokyo Disneyland, it is clean and the staff are incredibly helpful and happy in everyway! They even did their best to understand our very beginner Japanese.People watching was probably a highlight and the parade really was spectacular.We had come on a Thursday not in school holidays but this didn't seem to make any difference, unfortunately it was so crowded that we only got to go on one ride. After only being able to secure one fast pass that was within a reasonable time. (Not 2045 at night).  (I refuse to wait 100mins for a 2 min ride).The food was not great and even the popcorn vendors had lines about 40-50 people deep.We left feeling ripped off and generally dissatisfied. Hints if you are going:Get there early and have a plan of the ride/s you want to go on.Use the fast passes! But this only works for one ride really, as once you get one you can't get another for 2 more hrs (and by then they are often sold out so pick your favourite). To give you an idea there is even queing areas for the fast pass machines.Pack snacks as getting ANY food is a wait of at least 25-30minsDisney sea (that we went to the following day was a lot better but we were more organised and had a plan but still underestimated the crowds.As always, the question is would I go again.... No."
1890,5,16-Feb,Australia,Excellent Park but not the best Disneyland,"It is undeniably better than its European and Hong Kong counterparts however it does not quite match the sheer magnitude that is the American parks. Saying all this it is definitely worth the visit. It is essential to spend at least one full day there, getting there well before open to line up and ensure you already have a ticket or get there early to buy one. The park is very busy and it is best to have a plan of what you would like to do and how you are going to go about it. It was evident to me that the locals tend to go straight for the fastpass options and not line up straight away. We managed to go directly to Space Mountain ride it without waiting at all. We then used several fastpasses and continued to wait in line. The rides are good with long waits. As expected the rides are in Japanese so you do not ride them for the story if you don't speak the language. Japan is very into Frozen, with merchandise everywhere, they are currently having the year of Frozen for 2016. They have a Frozen parade which is nice to watch. The food and souvenirs are also overpriced as expected. The attention to detail is exceptional and it is worth a visit."
1891,5,15-Oct,N/A,Amazing down to the finest details,"Honestly Tokyo Disneyland is one if the most enjoyable theme parks i have ever been to. Everything is perfect. The japanese take alot of pride in their parks and it shows throughout all the operations. It is beautifully presented, very clean and have maintenance down packed so that rides very rarely break down. The food is amazing and everyone is just so polite that even long lines are civilised. The park is very well organised and themed wonderfully.Yes there can be large crowds (just remember the population and attendance is must larger than in the states) so you will need to plan your time there and utilize the fastpass system to decrease your waiting time in line. But either way this park is a must for everyone. "
1892,5,16-Mar,United States,Great Experience,"Recently jetted off to experience Disneyland in Tokyo. I visited both the Disneyland Park as well as the Disney Sea park. I think this is just for Disneyland so I will stick with just this park to begin. I was a little sad as a few attractions were closed (but this happens at all parks no matter what so they can keep them running in top notch performance, so I understood). Pirates of the Caribbean and Its a Small world were closed so we started with the Jungle Cruise. In pure Disney fashion, it was the same (for the most part). Some of the parts were different, but the driver/guide were funny as always and did a great job (even though I couldnt understand what they were saying). We went at night which makes it even better. One thing that I liked a lot better then in the USA is that they added fog, so at night this made it very spooky which I enjoyed! After the Jungle Cruise, we went right over to Big Thunder Mountain and got in line. This ride was great and quite a bit different then in the US but the same concept. They have done a great job to make the rides similar with a few changes to make it new. Splash Mountain was the only ride offering ""Single Rider"" so we buzzed over next to get on that, and we only had to wait about 10 minutes before boarding. One thing that surprised me was the lack of ""splashes"" that you get in FL and CA. When you go down the shorter water falls, you seem to end up on a platform that catches you without splashing you.. which was kind of a nice surprise in the chilly evening. The Haunted Mansion was very similar but once again with changes that made it fun. The outside resembled the mansion at WDW. We also went on the teacups and that was about it, as lines were horrible. We got some food and tried to enjoy the fireworks but they didn't seem to go at the advertised times, but got a view when we were at dinner. We tried to do Disneyland and Disney Sea all in one day, which is totally possible, but tight. Lines at these parks are way worst then in the USA and Fast Passes were very hard to get. Space Mountain was a 300 minute wait, and we couldnt justify waiting in that line when only here for a half day... as we wouldn't be able to go on anything else, so much to our dismay we had to skip it. The rides are also built for smaller and shorter people so I felt like I towered over everyone!!!"
1893,4,15-Nov,Singapore,1st disney Trip! ,Overall quite pleasant.. however it would be better if there's the fireworks~~~we miss it due to a drizzle... üò¢üò¢üò¢ mickey house time was too short and it was very rushing for us... din manage to pose for a nice pic with mickey... food serve was all fast food... didn't manage to get some hot ramen or cha soba... maybe will nt visit it another time... will try USS the next tm i go tokyo... 
1894,5,16-Feb,Malaysia,Brief Tokyo Disneyland Experience,"When people advised you to go there during the weekdays instead of weekend, please heed their advice! And when people tell you that it was the happiest place on earth and about how magical it is -- believe them! However, to maximize your experience I would recommend spending two days here, and acquiring the Fast Pass would be a good idea. "
1895,5,15-Apr,Japan,great place,lets talk about Tokyo Disneyland  if u want to go there and enjoy ur time u have to go from early morning and from Monday to Friday is the best time  coz its not goanna be crowded like in the weekend and u wont have to stay long time on the line ps: I went there  on Saturday it was so crowded but it was worth it
1896,5,15-Nov,Malaysia,LOVE LOVE DISNEY,"Ive been to all current Disneyland and disneyworld. Tokyo disney ranked 3rd after anaheim & disneyworld. Definitely worth going if you have children, makes you feel like a kid! we spent 2 days in disneyland and 2 days at tokyo sea. loved every moment !"
1897,4,16-Mar,Singapore,Too little time too many attractions,There are 7 lands and honestly the queue for exciting rides can be up to 2 hrs..the star tours is great for family exciting but not scary.peter'pan flight is interesting and one seem to be able to fly above the sky seeing the story about peter pan.haunted mansion though sound scary but is funny in some aspects.i was unable to cover all the worlds..for the two worlds that i missed out i hope to return one day to enjoy it..
1898,5,15-Apr,Indonesia,Great Hotel!,Nice hotel with tinkerbell theme.Will go there again if i go to Tokyo! The staffs so friendly although they speak english only a little bit.The hotel have small shop so we can buy breakfast if we didnt take breakfast. 
1899,5,16-Mar,Canada,Very efficient and friendly,"First off: there is no way to find a ""slow day"": we came here on a TUESDAY, and Fast Passes were sold out by 11am. Secondly: as with most attractions, it isn't cheap for souvenirs and/or food.That being said, I'd say take what I said with a grain of salt.  I've been to the one in Anaheim on three separate occasions, and it is a safe bet because you're also close enough to visit Universal Studios.However, even though the rides are fairly similar, Tokyo Disney is far more efficient and clean. A 35 minute wait time is actually only 20 because the cast members are exceptional is ensuring a quick loading and unloading procedure.Also, we went to Tokyo when the Canadian dollar was at its worse in close to a decade in terms of exchange rate. Souvenirs aside, food wasn't THAT expensive.Lastly, each cast member has a smile on their face at all times, and in general Japanese people are much more polite and orderly, which makes the whole experience that much more enjoyable. And to top it off: Japanese people are REALLY into dressing for Disney. Men and women, young and middle aged, will have some sort of Disney attire or get up on. Couples, especially, like to dress up together or wear the same Disney clothing. It certainly makes it easy for anyone to find their inner child again.It isn't ground breakingly new, but the overall experience is much more enjoyable."
1900,3,16-Mar,N/A,Good but not great,"Went with my partner, took the train in which was quite easy to find from Shinjuku, fast pass is definatly useful "
1901,5,15-May,N/A,The Kingdom of Dreams & Magic,"At last I've been here! Well it is very far from the central of Tokyo and I thought I couldn't make it because I have an early flight to catch on the next day at Narita Airport. But because I was quite confident on my ability to read the train map, see... I arrived at this Tokyo wonderland hehe!After transit from one train to another, from subway to other type of train lines, and experience the train crossed the ocean, at last I reached at Maihama Station (JR Line). The Tokyo Disneyland main gate is adjacent to both Maihama and Tokyo Disney station. You can walk or purchase a ticket to take a ride on this special train that rounding the entire land.Take a look on my photos... Superb!"
1902,5,15-Sep,United States,Halloween at Disney,"The park was decked out in all of its Halloween finest.  I loved how themed everything was.  Food, cups, trays, packaging was all things disney.  We didnt check our calender before coming apparently we came during a national holiday so it was very packed.  Still had a great time.  Awesome park."
1903,3,16-Mar,N/A,So so,"Great workers who are willing to help the tourist especially foreigners. However, if u visited Hong Kong Disneyland before this might not have much surprise. It is almost the same as the HK one. Too many people on the day I visited, queuing for almost 90mins just for a 3mins play. The ticket is 6900yen and could purchase online. "
1904,5,16-Mar,United Kingdom,Crazy but fun ,I visited here in 2005 and it was great. Very strange having disney with a japanese twist but fun none the less. A full day and higly reccommended 
1905,5,15-Nov,Malaysia,Worth every yen!,"This was my second trip and a first for my husband. We spent the whole day there from 9:30am until closing -- we got on every ride we could, watched every parade that took place and walked into every retail shop to buy all souvenirs we could. Some tips to avoid disappointment and maximize your visit:1. Choose your date and buy your tickets online. Why wait in queue (could be up to a 40 minute wait) when you can enter the park immediately on arrival? They park will close its doors when it has reached the maximum number of visitors for the day. Only those with pre-purchased tickets are allowed entry (and access to public transportation heading this way).2. Print out the map and ""study"" your route. One day might not be enough to cover the whole park. Hence studying the park and its attractions would help you maximize your day.3. Take advantage of Fast Pass (for attractions) and Fast Seating (for restaurants). By taking these passes, you just need to turn up at the attraction/restaurant within the time frame stipulated. Since waiting time could go up to 1.5 hours for popular attractions/restaurants, this allows you to queue up for another attraction and return to the attraction with the Fast Pass later. p.s. After you have taken a Fast Pass or Fast Seat, there will be a cooling period before you can take another one.4. If you see a souvenir you like, buy it there and then. We made that mistake and thought we could buy it later at another shop. Unfortunately it was a specialty souvenir and by the time we got round to the shop that sold it, it was close for the day. 5. Send yourself a postcard from Disneyland. Buy your postcard and stamps at the stationery shop (first shop closest to entrance) and mail it out to get the special Disney stamp.6. To get best seats for the parade, you are allowed to book your spot 90 minutes before the show starts. Bring your mats as front row seats means you have to sit on the ground.We are already making plans to go again. This time we might opt for a 2 day pass and stay somewhere closer to avoid the 1 hour travel time."
1906,5,15-Apr,Thailand,great place to visit with family/friends/couple,This is an amazing place to visit. It's not a teenage place but it's suite for everyone. There are a lot of cute cartoon characters. I really love Disneyland.
1907,5,15-Nov,United Kingdom,2nd childhood,I visited Tokyo Disneyland with a friend.  She and i had a fun time together. Disneyland is a perfect place to have childlike innocence and experience fun activities.  The day had never ending laughter. Even the long lines at the popular rides were opportunities to people watch or just chat. Perhaps the only bad thing i can think of is that disney staff only spoke in japanese. There were times during parades that they would provide instructions in japanese that we would completely not understand. I was worried for health and safety purposes to be stuck with a crowd during an emergency without any guidance on how to be safe.
1908,5,15-Jun,Australia,Childhood experience beyond belief,"I had never been to any of the Disneylands so when in Japan with my then 10 year old, it had to be done. Not only is it the cleanest theme park I have ever been to, but all the oh so familiar themes and anthems (eg small world) in Japanese was mind blowing.The ease in getting around, lack of long queues and array of things to do was more than enough to fill in at least one day. A highlight would have to the popcorn vending machines all had different flavours. I highly recommend the soy sauce.Then to top it off is the variety of food and you can't not see the parade. One of the truly great joys I have shared with my family. Tokyo Disneyland is an absolute winner for any age."
1909,5,16-Feb,United Kingdom,Worth a Visit,"Really interesting, has proper Disney feel but with Japanese twist. Staff are very helpful and attentive. Easy to get to from central Tokyo too."
1910,5,15-Dec,Singapore,Our kids simply loved Tokyo Disneyland,"We went for our second visit to Tokyo Disneyland in Dec 2015. Our previous visit was in Dec 2014. Both visits were done during the Christmas holiday period.Our two kids aged 4 and 6 simply loved Tokyo Disneyland: well-designed rides, fantastic parades, show restaurants and yummy popcorns!The only complaint we had would be the long queues, though I suppose the queues are there for all popular theme parks during the Christmas holiday period.For our full review on Tokyo Disneyland, visit ourtravelstory.com."
1911,5,16-Feb,Australia,Fantastic,"Disneyland is a must, you will be disappointed if you do not go, its not as big as LA , But much much cleaner, better food,better overall experience."
1912,5,16-Feb,Indonesia,Amazing Park for all ages!,"This was my second visit to the Park after the one back in 1985. Amazingly it stays a great fun for families. A huge park, very clean, lots of fun with very friendly English speaking staff. You will never get lost and confused in the Park.I and wife literally spent the whole day in the Park. We were so lucky having to see all the parades during the visit. From the daytime Happines is Here, special Frozen Fantasy (with Princess Elsa and Olaf), the evening magical parade and astonishing Once Upon a Time. We entered the lottery for Once Upon a Time and managed to secure seats in th viewing area :-)Although it was still winter, the crowd was still packed. Queueing time is still over 30 mins for every ride but it was all worth to wait. We did not manage to see many characters for taking pictures, only with Uncle Scrooge and Pinocchio.It was great being in the place where you see everyone is happy with a big smile no matter their age. We will return definetely."
1913,5,16-Feb,Japan,A great day in the park,"Visited Tokyo Disneyland during mid February; rained during most of the day and was cold, but that didn't stop us enjoying every moment.It was fairly busy but not as bad as have heard it can be in Spring/Summer, so seems to be a good time to visit. Queues moved quickly - longest was perhaps 30 minutes, for Meet Mickey. Recommend using the ""Fast Pass"" as much as possible, especially for the big popular rides such as Star Tours, Space Mountain, etc.Sp much in the park. Spent around 14 hours in the park, from opening to closing, and did not see or do everything.Lots of places to sit, eat, and buy souvenirs. Most shops have the same items, but there are smaller shops and specialty shops in the different areas so worth looking for different things (special shops for Star Wars, Toy Story, etc. to go with the rides/areas).Prices for food/drinks and souvenirs are a little high for most things, but quality is good so can't complain too much. The entrance fee for the park is due to rise to around 7,500yen, but I think it is reasonable for all you can see and do in the park without the need to pay anything extra."
1914,4,15-Jul,Finland,Family fun,"Spent 2 days with three girls (9,7,3). Lots of fun rides. Remember to use the fast passes. Long lines to stroller rent in the morning. We took a break at the hotel during the day and returned back later. Otherwise kids would not been up to stay at the park until fireworks. "
1915,5,15-Oct,United States,Oh Disneyland,The park is great as one would expect form a Disney park. Their covered Main Street is nice. Sadly disappointed in the souvenirs. Not being owned by Disney has its downsides--like only having the same souvenirs in every store in the park--
1916,5,16-Feb,N/A,Fun day at Tokyo Disneyland,"We visited during Chinese New Year which boosted the crowd levels a little, but we were still able to do most of the attractions we wanted to. FastPass helped with that too, of course. I did like the tradition of sitting for the parades - certainly makes a big difference from the parks in other parts of the world where seeing a parade can sometimes be a big free-for-all!! Like all theme parks you do a lot of walking, so be prepared! All in all a very enjoyable day."
1917,5,16-Feb,Singapore,Magical!,It was a huge park! Crowded but park was well managed & organised so Q move fast. Very clean & professionally run.Staff were exceptionally professional.All of them takes pride in doing their job well which makes it a beautiful place to be in.Stress free & happy place! Popcorn wagons are everywhere! Different ones sells different flavored ones & different character popcorn bucket. After you finish eating you can go any wagon and pay just to top up another flavored popcorn! Some limited edition popcorn bucket are only available at the confectionary shop (the first shop after you enter the pack..it sells all kinds of snacks!)..Q at the payment counter..tell them you wanna buy the popcorn bucket (when i went the limited one was Stitch)..you pay to get an empty bucket and they will give you a popcorn voucher then you just need to go to any popcorn wagon to fill up the bucket! Do ask for an English park map when you enter the park...make things much easier!Go round making the souvenir medallions! Its available in the park..the monorail stations..the hotels..Then get a mini album from the Disney shop for keepsake! Enjoy & have fun!
1918,4,15-Aug,United Kingdom,Good Disney Park,"I visited Tokyo Disneyland with some friends in August 2015. If this was a park owned by any other company it'd easily get 5 stars, but for Disney, it does lack...something.We all had a great day. We loved riding the traditional Disney rides like Splash Mountain, Star Tours, Space Mountain, I also loved Winnie the Pooh's Honey Hunt. There is so much to do for all the family, kids especially.Don't miss one of the shows, my favourite was the fireworks at the end, they were amazing. There are plenty of places to eat too, we ate in the Queen of Heart's restaurant which was impeccably themed, good value and just really nice. We also bought snacks throughout the day.It is a great park, but only a good Disney park, the atmosphere is slightly lacking compared to the likes of Florida's equivalent, and I don't like how Maine Street has a roof on it but it does make sense given Tokyo's climate. There are also plenty of ships to purchase gifts and souvenirs. Japanese theme parks in general seem to specialise in cookies and biscuits, a great gift for anyone!You can't go to Tokyo and not visit the Disney parks, they're amazing!"
1919,4,15-May,Malaysia,Childhood Memory,"Tokyo has two childhood theme parks, which has Disneyland and Disneysea, we have decided to visit - Disneyland! I'm exactly a Disney girl, there's something magical about the place that none can pass really. It was a place that I enjoyed previously as well.There are seven themed areas in the park:- the World Bazaar, the four classic Disney lands ( Adventureland, Westernland, Fantasyland and Tomorrowland), and two mini-lands (Critter Country and Mickey's Toontown). Most of the rides and games also mirrored after those in the original Disneyland as they are based on American Disney films and fantasies. Most of the rides had really long queues even on a Monday so we tried to get quick passes to certain rides and queued for the rest. There have many of finger foods to keep you occupied, all of them had long queues!Fireworks is at 10.30pm every night like the other Disneylands, we will stay back to watch! It lasts for only a few minutes but it's an extremely splendid sight that you will remember for a long time. Would love to visit Disneysea next since it's unique to only Japan."
1920,5,16-Jan,Australia,The ultimate kids playground,"Although freezing cold, we enjoyed a fun-filled day at Disney on rides, attractions, viewing the parade (which was much better than I had anticipated - from an adults point of view), and lunch at one of the Japanese restaurants. Time queueing is to be expected, but I didn't feel like it was too much considering the number of people around. We used the fast pass system very efficiently though!  Space Mountain was crazy - not good if you suffer from claustrophobia! But my kids couldn't get enough, and went back for more!"
1921,5,15-Dec,Singapore,Excellent,"This place just managed to bring joy to all visitors. Unlike others, i.e. HK Disneyland, things were in order and a class above the rest. Staff were extremely friendly and always wore a smile. Pointers.. do visit on a off peak days. Which in my view is already quite packed, cannot imagine a peak period crowd."
1922,5,16-Jan,United Kingdom,Everything we were expecting and more!,"Doesn't seem as big as the other Disney resorts but makes it easier to get around with children! Ride queues were quite long, especially for a Wednesday in January, but worth it! Fantastic parades, especially the night one. Be warned though, it's all very frozen heavy at the moment!!!"
1923,5,16-Feb,N/A,Disney Fans will love it,I'm a big disney fan and this was my first ever disney themed park I thought it was fantastic! We were lucky and went when the park had Frozen Fantasy theme happening in the park.The lines are long due to everyone wanting to do everything which is what makes FastPass rides fantastic. But if you take your time you'll find other magical treasures throughout the park.If you are looking at going to dineyland and are after a certain theme look up before which season suits you as theme of the park do change regularly.Otherwise have fun and let your inner child loose
1924,3,15-Apr,N/A,I just love Disneyland,"And this one was no exception. It had so many cute things and rides and stuff to buy. The food was okay, not spectacular, but the rest of the shopping was A+ and the rides and everything. *sigh* Yeah, just if you want Disney, pop along to this. You won't be disappointed. But get there early. The crowds really didn't start until about lunchtime - we walked onto Space Mountain, so definitely worth getting there early."
1925,Viv,15-Jul,United States,Nice Attraction,Tokyo Disneyland is pretty much a copy of the theme park in California.  The basic difference is that a few of the attractions are Japanese oriented where the same attraction in the USA is American.  This is a very nice park and well worth the visit.  You can easily spend an entire day here enjoying yourself.  Be sure to see the daily parade both day and night.
1926,5,15-Oct,United States,It's worth the trip,"I met an American friend who was vacationing in Japan and we decided to compare Tokyo Disneyland to other Disneylands. They have taken the Disney concept and improved it. Having it's own train stop makes it easy and convenient to arrive and depart. Very clean in a Disney way. We arrived mid morning on Halloween and a Saturday making the park quite full. Even though the park was well occupied the lines for the rides and food were relatively short. We wandered around observing and enjoying the 'costumed' guests as much as park employees. Our only disappointment was that after arranging to stay for the fireworks (an unscheduled on-site dinner) an announcement was made a few minutes before the fireworks were to go off that they were unable to display them that night. Even then we had a great time, many rides, lots of food, and Oh yes lots of souvenirs!"
1927,5,16-Jan,N/A,Bringr back the child in everyone,we hand the best time of our lives! the view was so breath taking! love the flowers (can't even name them) the guards are so polite that they can make the crowd sit in preparation for the parade' they say it in a very nice way. the rides too was jus exhausting. it seems that everyone comes early as the crowd were huge all waiting for the gates to open. never miss to visit Tokyo Disneyland when you're in Tokyo.üëçüëçüëçüëå
1928,5,15-Sep,Canada,Went solo to check it out - very nice!,"I have been to Disney Land/World in the States and Disney Land in Hing Kong so I need to check this one out.  I am 50 so I have a different perspective but it is so neat to check it out I did not go on any of the rides but totally enjoyed watching all the kids have a great time.  The Asian parks are not as big as their US counterparts but there is enough to keep a family entertained all day.  Very clean, well organized as you would expect Disney land to be.  Overall a great way to spend the day.  The subway connections are excellent and very easy to use."
1929,5,16-Jan,Australia,"Snowy day - no crowds, no lines!","This was our second visit to Tokyo Disneyland and we were dismayed to wake to a snowy morning.  It turned out to be the best thing ever.  In January 2015 we had many long, long waits.  But this time, no crowds at all, and we went on all our favourite rides over and over with no queues whatsoever.   In doing so we learned that there are 50 different versions of the Star Wars ride!  The Pooh Bear ride is unique to Tokyo Disneyland and great for younger kids.  The snow eased in the afternoon and skies were clear.  The light show projected onto the Disney castle is fabulous - as is the electrical night-time parade.  Be aware that in Winter, Tokyo Disneyland closes earlier - about 7.30pm earlier in the week.  They also close Splash Mountain during Winter months."
1930,4,15-Aug,South Korea,Really really crowded,Its a really really crowded place to visit... specially if you are with little ones...But you will not be disappointed at the end of the day... now we remember our Tokyo trip and its on the top of our list of best things we didget there early...Plan a head(download a map and know whats where)check the schedules for the parade... you dont want to miss them... 
1931,5,15-Dec,Australia,Was a Wicked Christmas Day,Was here with my wife and sister on xmas day. Had an awesome time there apart from our waiting time to the rides ( splash mountain) where the wait was 2 and a half hours though we were expecting that as it was our first time at any Disneyland . A little bit more information on how our express passes to rides are used would have been helpful . The Turkey Legs are definitely worth the line up. The fireworks display where a great way to finish the night.
1932,5,16-Jan,Singapore,Great rides,"This wonderland for all ages ! Great fun but do expect longer lines for popular rides. Good options for food. Some restaurants have set menus which can be viewed before you enter. Or you can snack whilst in the Q. One day is not enough depending on your total queuing time. A must see is the fireworks at night. Head for the castle for a show starting 7:30pm, followed by their grand fireworks."
1933,5,15-Apr,United Arab Emirates,disneyland is always nice!,"i have visited 3 different Disneyland parks and the one in Tokyo is the best. it was my second time in Tokyo Disneyland. i love Toontown! it can be found only in Tokyo Disneyland, not other parks!"
1934,4,15-Mar,Australia,Good fun day,"We had a great day here. It was extremely busy so definitely get the front quick line passes the minute you get into the park. It will save hours on rides! The parades were fantastic, so definitely worth getting a good seat and waiting. The night lights parade is worth sticking around for. "
1935,4,15-Apr,Indonesia,Very big amusement park,"I went here with my students. Consist of 50 peoples. At first all of us was so excited to explore this place. We came here in April, the weather was very nice, cool and windy at that time. But then it was not as our expectation, the crowd of the people who were lined made us not happy. You need around 30-45 minutes only to get in or board on one attraction. So be ready with the long lines of the people especially if you come during peak season."
1936,4,16-Jan,Singapore,The happiest place on earth,Disney land is indeed the happiest place on earth. the happy parade was amazing. definitely brought out the child in me. the place is easily accessible from Tokyo via jr. however do be warned that queues start as early as 7am. ticket offices open only at 8am and the park only opens officially at 9am. food is limited in the parks unless you'd like to spend money on an overpriced meal in their restaurants. as there are a whole lot of people. do expect about 50-70mins wait per ride. even the fast pass tickets at 11am are meant for rides at 4pm (can you imagine the number of people). but who can we blame? it's Disney land after all (: 
1937,5,16-Jan,Australia,Exceeded my expectations,Fun place for anyone! Staff are really friendly and helpful. Recommend staying to watch the amazing light parade and waiting to see the castle lit up with fireworks.
1938,3,16-Jan,Australia,Exciting but some negatives. ,"We first visited Tokyo Disneyland in mid 1980's with our daughter and this trip was a return with her and her family with 2 children, aged 13 and 9. We had a great day, however, my memory of it was better than this current experience. The lines for some rides were impossibly long and using fast pass was not always effective.  Often our tickets wouldn't scan properly or the time for the ride was hours away. The rides we did go on were great. The parades were a spectacle but there were no ""characters "" walking around the park outside the parades. This was disappointing as we had bought an autograph book for the youngest child to get signatures during the day. The light and fireworks shows were spectacular.  The food was the worst we have experienced in a theme park anywhere. A definite big negative and something which really needs improvement.  Access on train system was easy and fast (once wed worked out the metro). "
1939,5,16-Jan,Australia,Amazing!,Amazing theme park for children and adults alike! The park is similar to Disneyland in LA with a good assortment of rides and entertainment. Most of the rides are in Japanese with some English (this doesn't really make too much difference to the experience). The 'Electric lights' parade is worth watching- incredible.expect plenty of queuing but the goes goes quickly. The staff at Disneyland are wonderful- so friendly and helpful.
1940,5,16-Jan,N/A,An Amazing Night @ Disney Tokyo,"It was not just a place for kids but us adults had a blast as well. Best time we found out to go was during weekends when they have floats. We were told that there were no fireworks, however this proved to be untrue as loads of fireworks were fired later into the night over the castle!! "
1941,5,15-Oct,Australia,Be prepared,"I'm a theme park addict, so when I found out that my family was taking me to Tokyo Disneyland over Halloween I was very excited. The people who visited all dressed up in Disney themed costumes - I felt out of place in my jeans! I would recommend Pooh's Hunny Hunt, Splash Mountain, Space Mountain and Buzz Lightyear's Shooting Ride.We also stayed in the Disney hotel which was beautiful. I would recommend this although it is pricey because you get an extra 15 minutes in the park than the day visitors do. It doesn't sound like much, but during this time you can get fast passes for attractions. I managed to do around 2-3 rides in the 15 minutes.The very first thing I did was familiarise myself with the fast pass system which is very important because it means you don't have to waste time lining up on popular attractions.The park is very efficiently run and kept quite tidy. The staff were all very friendly and they made Tokyo Disneyland the ""happiest place on Earth""."
1942,4,15-Feb,New Zealand,Cool experience,I visited in 2006 and loved it. Wasn't blown away by the rides (though the star wars ride and underground roller coaster were both very cool) but the atmosphere was amazing Would be great if you had kids.
1943,5,15-Oct,Malaysia,Great experience,"I love all the roller coaster inside Disneyland. It is in my range of thrill. The speed is good and what I like about it that it has no part where you went upside down, which I hate the most! (Actually I'm a scaredy cat). I just happen to know that everyone can have express pass for each ride but with allocated time stated. Each time, only 1 pass can be redeemed. After (I think) 2 hours, only then we can redeem another express pass for another ride."
1944,4,15-Aug,Indonesia,Love it!,"You might read lots of reviews on this attraction. My tips are get a fast-pass! I was here in August 2015 and without a fast-pass. Luckily it was not a peak season so I can ride most of the attraction that I want. Still I cant ride all of them but still I think that fast-pass is worth it. Get a map! You can find the map in the website so you can plan everything before your visit. But when you enter the park, don't forget to take the map so you can see which attraction that you want to ride first. Take few of it, in case you lose it or because it's wet due to the rain. Ask the staffs! The staffs were friendly. Even you cant speak Japanese, show them where you want to go in the map, and they'll direct you. Or if you want to take group photo, don't hesitate to ask them to take your photo. Tripod is not allowed. Enjoy! Even when it's very crowded, I think you should enjoy it because you're there with your family or your friends."
1945,4,16-Jan,Singapore,Still a fantasy come true,"Stepping into Disneyland has never failed to transport me back to my childhood days. Tokyo Disneyland is beautiful but just too crowded. Maybe i have grown up as the park seems smaller. The two parades by the crew of Disney are just amazing. Nevertheless, I will still come back again and again. The child in me is still very much alive."
1946,3,15-Dec,Turkey,Just Disneyland like all. Nothing different.,"So long lines for same rides you get everywhere else in the world. If you have been to Disneyland, simply go to DisneySea. "
1947,4,15-Aug,Japan,Tricky FastPass,"went here twice, first time I know nothing about fastpass and just ride 2 attraction, was arrived 12 a clock too, wasting money, but in my second visit I know how to use fastpass and its very tricky, before you enter Disneyland make sure you read all disneyland attraction, get fastpass as much as you can, in my second visit I went early and almost ride all attraction, also if you wanna buy souvenir buy when you done with attraction, saving time :Dtheres a Disney character parade every day, one thing I amaze in this place, my iPhone was missing and went to lost and found place, then 3 hours after that they found my iPhone :D staff speak english in lost and found, very helpful."
1948,5,16-Jan,N/A,Be smart and plan it out,"Okay so you have read all the reviews about the queues but if you are smart and plan your day you can still have an awesome time even on the busiest of days. When you get your ticket you get a map and a list of all the parades and goings on so read it and check where everything is, where you are going to be at that time and such. We got a starlight pass (3pm to closing) on new years day and saw 2 different parades and a mad projection light and laser show with fire works and then some fireworks to Disney music. We planned this around where we were going to be and the stated 15-25 minute queues were less than that, we went on Pirates of the Caribbean, Swiss family treehouse and The Enchanted tiki room, wandered round Westernland, Critter country and Fantasyland, Toontown was fun with the Roger Rabbit ride and Gadgets go coaster then round the treehouse. We saved Tomorrowland for last with the raceway before a mad lights parade then queued for an hour to do space mountain just before closing. All the staff speak passable English or better and everyone was lovely, food was reasonably priced and tasty, the site was clean and I can see why so many locals have annual passports. Don't expect to do every ride in one day because you just can't, enjoy looking at the attractions and make the most of the stuff that a lot of effort has gone into making like the stuff you just walk around."
1949,1,15-Nov,N/A,Hell on Earth!,"First, went there with the car. Since it is on the outskirts of Tokyo I expected a parking. And yes they had... They charged me 3,000 yen for the parking. I have never seen such an expensive parking in any other place in Japan, and I have been all over the country.Then we walked 10 minutes to the entrance. At that time I started to realize where we were heading too... Passed the gates and there were so many people it was difficult to walk freely. We tried to get on several attractions and the waiting time was from 2 to 3 hours in all. Standing in line several hours for a 2 min ride is not my idea of fun. So we tried to eat something. And queues everywhere again. Plus crazy expensive prices for everything. After walking, or trying to because there was so many people, we decided we would better spend the day in another place and we left with the feeling of having being robbed and scammed.The people managing this place should limit the number of customers but apparently the money is much more important than the Disney ""Magic"". Don't be fooled too and spend your quality time with your beloved ones somewhere you are not robbed."
1950,1,15-Dec,Canada,Try your BESTEST to get the fast pass,"I was in Tokyo on Dec.  22 and planned Disneyland on the 23rd. My family of 6. My husband and I, and 4 boys. 17, 14, 12 and 9. TERRIBLE MISTAKE of not arranging for the fast pass.  Spent over 400 usd getting in and after hours at the park, ended up taking 2 rides. 2 rides!A brief history of my travels. I have been to every single Disneyland in the world. LA, Florida, Paris and Hong Kong. This was the cherry on top. Or was supposed to be!It seems as though the entire of Tokyo was present at the park that day. I have never seen such lineups at EVERY single ride. Such a major dissapointment. The weather was ok. Sort of dreary and drizzling in the evening. But the crowds stayed strong. The lineups were everywhere, the rides, the restaurants, the washrooms. I was at my wits end by the end of the day. Such a major dissapointment. Disneyland was more like Dismaland üòÖ"
1951,3,16-Jan,Malaysia,Mixed feelings,"The park is huge compared to HK Disneyland. The staff were all smiling and friendly. I was impressed with how the Japanese waiting for parade show and their politeness. Not worth visiting during peak season due to fast pass system wasn't that beneficial to visitor as you have to queue early for famous ride and it will then release after 2/3 hours in order to get the second fast pass. By that time, the fast pass for your desirable ride might be out which is very disappointing. The queue was about 80-160minutes during peak season. You might end up played few rides in the park for one day which is totally not worth for the price that you pay for. The food is quite pricey as this is Disney. Popcorn was sold at 310yen and popcorn with container was sold at 1600-2100yen depends on characters. Long anticipated fireworks show at 8.30pm was cancelled due to weather same goes to Disneysea. You can see massive crowd everywhere inside the park. The park have Japanese language speaking ride or show which are a little confusing to NON-JAPANESE TOURIST."
1952,4,16-Jan,Philippines,Grab that Fastpass!,"This Disneyland is a very nice themepark. Although the attractions are mainly in Japanese but foreigners can still enjoy it. Unlike some themeparks that are highly commercialized, this Park is well-organized and thinks of the welfare of its visitors. The secret to enjoying the park & not waste too much time in the lines is to make sure that you grab the Fastpass tickets before they close it for the day, this pass is FREE. Enjoy!"
1953,5,15-Dec,United States,THIS is the happiest place on Earth!!!,"First I will say this: like with every visit to a Disney theme park, get there early and try to go on a week day.  Disney parks are always crowded.  We got there right after the part opened at 8am and there were already a ton of people.  The waits get longer as the day progresses, so we started using the FastPass at around 10:30 am and walked around, watched and tried other things while we waited. Tokyo Disneyland has been there for a very long time and it‚Äôs almost an exact replica of Disneyland California.  This being said, you feel like you are in a different world because everything is in Japanese and it is brilliant!!!  Even though most of the attractions are in Japanese, we loved it all.  It did help that we‚Äôve visited both Disney World Orlando and Disneyland California many times, so we didn‚Äôt feel lost in translation.  The staff is very friendly and helpful and pretty much everyone who works there speaks English, which we appreciated (this is not the case in the rest of Tokyo).  Snacking at the part is an adventure in and of itself.  From the steamed-bun mickey to the nut and meat pastry to the different kinds of popcorn‚Ä¶ you must try as much as you can, especially while you‚Äôre killing time until you can use your FastPass.  Tokyo Disneyland is very much worth the visit, especially if you‚Äôre a Disney fan like I am."
1954,5,15-Apr,New Zealand,„Åô„Åî„Åã„Å£„Åü,My favourite theme park in Asia. It's more of a place for teens/adults because of the sheer size of the park. My favourite ride would have to be space mountain or splash mountain. Understanding a little bit of Japanese or going there with a person that speaks Japanese is ideal. Using the bus is a pretty good way to get there since the trains are crowded. The night light show is something you have to see.
1955,5,15-Jun,United States,First time here & Loved it!,"This was our first time to Tokyo Disney. We were there for one day and one day at Disney Seas and saw everything! Amazing how guest/service orientated the employees are. Got lots of pictures of how the locals all dress up to attend. It's quite the event! The girls wear matching clothes, and so do the guys. Pretty fun and got some awesome pictures of it. We had heard about the crowds and how everyone rushes to get back to Toy Story...we waited till an hour after opening to enter because we had heard about this. There is a line for fast passes, but manageable. Get Toy Story fast passes first as it seems to be the most liked ride. Our time wasn't until that evening so they go quickly! Purchase a popcorn container (we got the alien from toy story) and get refills throughout the day. Such unique flavors like bubble tea, jalapeno, caramel, chocolate, etc. Fortunately the rate of exchange was good for US travelers so it was really reasonable! We will go back again someday as we love Disney! :)"
1956,5,16-Jan,Australia,A cynical Aussie,"I was all like ""yeah Disneyland, better go for the little one"".......Holly crap! This place is awesome!We stayed a few night at Hotel Okura Bay and did 1 day at Disneyland & 1 day at DisneySea.From the moment you get on the bus to take you to monorail that runs around the 2 parks, you are but with smiles, Disney images & music from the movies. It all starts before you get in the park. We went in a rather busy day, so we made good use of the fast pass system. You use these ticket vending machines to reserve your place on a ride. Sometimes an hour or 3 later. But you do other stuff in the meantime. Star Wars, Monsters Inc, Space Mountain, river boats, singing bears - it's all good. But the big surprise? The God Damn Parades. I didn't think I would enjoy, but ya just gotta do it. We went from open to close (10 - 8) and I didn't think our 9 year old would make it, but she did with some energy to spare. And the staff were awesome with her. So good. Sooo good. "
1957,4,15-Dec,Singapore,Happiest place on earth indeed!,"Being my first Disneyland ever, i am overwhelmed by everything! The park was well maintained and everything was great. The staff were friendly. All of us young and old embraced the child in us. The only downside i had on the visit was the crowd. The queue took up most of the time of the visit. From the rides to getting food we need to queue for almost everything. Will definitely return next time we visit Tokyo!"
1958,1,15-Dec,Australia,Would not reccomed at all!!,"Massive crowds and extremely long lines, shortest line was 40 mins and it was for the teacups. Tried to use their version of 'FastPass' at 0930 and had to wait until 1700 to use it and when we tried to use it on a different ride it wouldn't let us try again until 1130. Overall bad experience!!!"
1959,3,15-Dec,Australia,Beware of crowds,"To be honest, a bit disappointed due to massive crowds and lack of info on the fastpass system. This is a free system but seemed to close quite early in the day. By the time we worked out how to use it we could only use it on one ride and then it closed (presume fully allocated for the day). Some rides had wait times of 120 minutes +. Better information and advice on fastpass for day visitors (as opposed to annual pass visitors) would be appreciated "
1960,4,15-Dec,Malaysia,For Kids and Kid at Heart,"Disneyland is truly for children and also grown up with kid at heart. Though more rides are suitable for younger teenager, unlike Universal Studio which more suitable for older teenager.Disneyland Tokyo is huge, it make Disney HK just like one of Disney Tokyo themeland. Though there are some similarities in certain rides/attractions - space mountain, it's a small world, Tom Sawyer Island Rafts, tree house. So, for those who have been to Disney HK, perhaps they can skip those rides/attractions and try others rides instead. This is because, Disney Tokyo is famous for over crowd, and it is almost impossible for one to have a chance to try all the rides in a day, 2 or 3 days more likely. Another tip, avoid weekend if possible.Star Tour is a must, especially for Star Wars fan. Though not that thrill or one of its' kind ride, but it is still a Star Wars experience. Haunted Mansion also recommendable, especially for whole family, only thing is, like other rides too, everything is in Japanese, so kind of not so scary for non japanese speaking riders.For muslim visitors, there is basically no restaurant that offers halal meal (unlike Disney HK), perhaps the management should consider to provide one, to cater for muslims visitors. However, one could exit the park (to have meal) and re admit (just required an invisible ink stamped on your hand).Given a choice, if one only have a day to spent at disney park, perhaps DisneySea is a better choice and it is the only Disney Sea in the world."
1961,5,16-Jan,Australia,Fun fun fun,It truly is the happiest place on earth.Staff are smiling n waving continuously.Queues are about 30mins.Rides are super fun.
1962,2,15-Dec,N/A,Way to busy,We went to Disney land on the 29th of December and it was way to crowed all the lines for rides where hours long even took an hour just to get food! Never have the desire to go again ever biggest waste of money 
1963,5,15-Dec,Philippines,Enchanting!,"Being a kid at heart, theme parks are always included in my itinerary! Of course, when I visited Tokyo, Tokyo Disneyland is a must-see for me. It is a very vast park, and yet, very clean! The staff are always roaming around making sure that everything is in order. It was very crowded when we went there, long lines everywhere, but still, we enjoyed the surroundings, the rides, the food, the merchandise and the parade. "
1964,5,15-Dec,Singapore,At least 1 full day!,"I wished I had more time to enjoy the various attractions and the atmosphere in Disneyland! I went there thinking that the place will be a kiddy place and I may not enjoy it.However, the moment I step into the park, everything changes, the atmosphere was just so contagious and every visitor looked so happy and excited! Visit it to live your younger days again! "
1965,5,15-Dec,Philippines,Still the best place on earth to feel like a child again,Tokyo Disneyland is still the best place on earth if you can't go to it's US counterpart. Hong Kong is a far cry compared to Tokyo and there are more rides to choose from. The parade both afternoon and evening are a must watch as this brings you back feeling like a child again. Looking back at children brings back memory when I was a child myself visiting Tokyo Disneyland for the first time. 
1966,2,15-Oct,United Kingdom,Very crowed and long waits,I am usually a big fan of Disneyland but the day we went (which was just a regular day- not a holiday) it was packed with people. We waited 1.5 hours to see Mickey Mouse and my child and to try any of the rides waiting time was about 45 minutes. 
1967,1,15-Dec,Singapore,Go at your own risk during peak season,"I must admit that the place itself was lovely. Well-maintained, friendly and efficient staff, even a rare sighting of Mount Fuji on a clear winter day.But the Qs were really scary and at the end of the day we only wanted to get out asap. Qs for everything from popcorn to toilets, not to mention we only got to go on less than half of the rides, and couldn't even get our 2nd fast pass. The Grand Emporium was literally recipe for a stampede, thankfully the locals and tourists were all very patient and considerate as they squeezed around the tight space.If the management is reading this, this is what I'll really like to see if i were to (dare to) make a trip there again1) limits to the daily visitor capacity (there doesnt seem to be any despite the website implying so, the crowd just got bigger and bigger as the day progressed) so as to optimise the enjoyment of those already inside.2) just as certain rides only allow riders of a certain height, certain obviously-for-young-children rides should be restricted to young children and their parents. Like the Dumbo elephant ride!"
1968,4,15-Feb,Brunei,"Beautiful, Clean and Organize",Love watching the parade and never ending photo area. Lots of walking. Many attractions and rides. Be sure to purchase 2 days ticket for disneyland and disneysea as you couldn't finish exploring both in one day. Although couldn't understand Japanese language but the area and atmosphere makes you feel like a kid again.
1969,5,15-Dec,Philippines,Fun for families with small kids,Our second day spent in Disneyland was fun but we were not able to ride again the recommended rides since a lot of people tourists or locals went also. We enjoyed the simple rides and plus the 2 parades and fireworks.
1970,3,15-Dec,Australia,Happiest Place On Earth...if you like waiting in line,"Once upon a time, in a kingdom not far from Tokyo, there was a place where you could wait in line for hours and hours on end and maybe just maybe get on a ride. You can even queue an hour for a turkey leg (which was my personal highlight of Disneyland). By the end of the day everyone's legs were weary and patience grew thin. Thankfully the line to get out isn't to bad.The End."
1971,4,15-Dec,Indonesia,Happy place to be (better avoid holiday season),"I went there on 30Dec and it was so packed with tourist both domestic and international. I like thrill ride and coasters. I get in around 10am and straight to fast pass for the new STAR TOURS ride at 10:30am. After finished the ride around 11am I managed to take fast past for the SPACE MOUNTAIN, but the next fast pass was for 7pm, can you believe it? So I bailed out thinking maybe because space mountain is high tech one and probably other ride would be more time-friendly. But, I was wrong, all thrill ride fast past were already for 7:30pm up. Omigawd, so I took BIG THUNDER as it looks furious, my fast pass for big thunder was for 8pm (Oh men, that means I've got to spend the whole day there until 8pm). Almost all big ride waiting time were for 2 hours or so. All fast pass were sold out quickly that day.So to fill in my time, I went to small rides (mostly for small kids) that I totally never ride in theme park (like train, ship, it's a small world, canoe). It was okay, better than nothing. At least the waiting time was around 30-45mins each. Cafe and restaurants were packed. All booking pass were also sold out. So I have to wait for 45mins-1hr for lunch in the restaurant.After I finished my lunch I checked the waiting time for all rides and the waiting time for space mountain became 130mins, WHAT! No sign of those people to give up.Anyway, I enjoyed the castle, shops and parades. At 8pm right after the parade I ride the Big Thunder and it was worth it! The ride was awesome, and since it was night time, everywhere was dark and that gave some chills. Well, to enjoy Disneyland more, better to come NOT during holiday season when domestic tourist tend to come to disneyland. I came to Disney Sea back in April (but the waiting time was not crazy as this."
1972,3,15-Dec,Malaysia,Brace yourself for the looooooooooonnnnnnngggg Q!,"It's the favourite theme park, not only foreign tourist but even the locals, so don't be surprised by the amount of visitors coming (most are locals!). You have to be patient and ready for whole day of queuing. From the moment you wait for the gates to open, to lining up for game/shows/parade, going to caf√©/restaurant/toilet/buying food/buying souvenirs/buying from cart wheel stores.......it's all in long queues! So, to save your time (unless you have annual pass and can come anytime of the year), my advice is:1) Pre-book your tickets especially Express Pass online, EP hardly available at the gates and Q is just too long.2) Get hold of the layout and plan your route. Know where to dash to the moment the gates opened.3) Fast Pass (FP) is the key to beat the Q, so learn to fully utilise this system. Find out where's the FP machine. Split up for a person to Q for FP and the other for current ride. You can‚Äôt have 2 FP to a ticket at any one time, but the next FP can be claimed 1 hour after each issuance. Plan your time wisely as the normal Q can be 1-3 hours for favourite rides.4) Another system they have is the Lottery system for the Minnie Oh! Minnie and One Man's Dream shows. You also need to claim the lottery from the machine but the tricky part is...it's a lottery system, so if you are not that lucky, you will not be able to enter. All tickets can draw once only.5) Learn to use the Priority Seating (PS) to book table for lunch/dinner as the Q outside restaurant can setback a lunch becoming a dinner.6) One of the main attraction is actually their parades (2-3 per day) and the locals actually brought floor mats to sit beside the route 2 hours earlier. If you want to be up close to the parade, book your place earlier by bringing floor mats or anything to sit as it's a long wait, but it's worth it.7) A very important tool to help you through the day is the Q time apps (many available in Play Store) (I used TDR Wait Time Check) which advise you status of the attraction/ride, current Q time, FP issuance status (issued till which session or finished), show and parade time/location/route, other info you may need. It's updated in real time so you may plan your day and improvise on the move.8) The most important thing is have yourself and family to be mentally prepared to accept the fact that you will not get to see/ride all the attractions here, and be prepared for the queue, even a popcorn stall can have 50-100 person queuing at any time.Must not miss their special flavoured popcorns (Milk Chocolate, Salt, Curry, Soy Sauce & Butter, Honey, Caramel) and the turkey drumstick. Be prepared to Q for at least 30min ‚Äì 1 hour for each stall.After a long day of Q, it explains why there's so many locals there, because it will take years to completely enjoy/see/explore/taste the whole theme park."
1973,5,15-Nov,Philippines,Where the magic begins...,"Since it was a weekend, expect to wait in line, usually about 30 minutes and could even go over an hour.  But no worries, while waiting in line for an attraction, you can always have one of your companions secure a FASTPASS. There are certain attractions, such as Space Mountain, Haunted Mansion and among others, marked with ‚ÄúFP‚Äù. Just place your ticket into the ticketing machine and get your FASTPASS ticket with the return time while you enjoy other areas of the Park. You may refer to your guide, which you can get FREE at the entrance. And just like other theme parks, you CANNOT bring FOOD and DRINKS inside and SMOKING is only allowed in designated areas. There are a lot of restaurants and refreshments inside, and they accept all major credit cards, including JCB Debit Card. Don‚Äôt forget to check the ENTERTAINMENT SCHEDULE so you could have an idea of what the Park have prepared for the day, especially that some of these activities overlap with each other. And if a day in the park wouldn‚Äôt be enough, you can always check the GUEST RELATIONS WINDOWS on how to upgrade your park ticket so you can go back the next day for a discounted rate. And lastly, if you‚Äôre travelling by train, don‚Äôt forget to check what time the last train leaves, as I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt want to be sleeping at the train station especially during the winter season. Enjoy, and let the magic remain!"
1974,4,15-Dec,Portugal,A truly magical place!,"As a 23 year old with no children, it may seem like an odd thing to have a Disney theme park as a first choice of what to do on vacation, but I don't regret it at all! Such a fun place for all ages. I concentrated on riding most of the rides (be prepared for some long lines-- but Fast Passes can help and they don't cost extra!). Even going around Christmas and NYE, the park wasn't incredibly crowded. The food cost a lot less than I expected for a theme park and it was great to experience all of the magic of Disney. See the parades and fireworks-- they were great!"
1975,4,15-Dec,Philippines,Very packed due to the Christmas holidays. ,"Never been to Disneyland when lines early in the morning were already 70mins. Other than the extremely long lines and waits I was happy weather was nice and cool, I would book at a different time the next time I come backMake sure to strategically fast pass your rides as soon as you enter the park. Also try to get advanced tickets and if you have young kids do not bring a stroller and just rent at the park. "
1976,4,15-Dec,Singapore,Disneyland Tokyo,"This place completes my global Disneyland resorts globally. Japan has 2 Disney parks. Disneyland and Disney Sea (unique). Both of these resorts are worth visiting. If you have been to the rest of the Disneyland (Paris, Hong Kong, Anaheim, Disneyland Florida) , then Tokyo Disneyland is pretty much similar (in terms of the rides). What differentiate the Tokyo Disneyland from the other Disneyland are its parade, souvenirs and performances.  There are 3 parades in a day! lots of unique and cute souvenirs (that you cannot find in the rest of the Disneyland), their 'live' performance.For the parades, the crowd starts 'reserving' seats 45 mins prior to Parade itself. They lay mats on the floor and await patiently for it to pass. So if you want good seats, you need to join them.  The souvenirs, well you need to be there to see it, I'm sure you will bring at least a bagful home. Their souvenir popcorn buckets are one of a kind and really cute, I brought 3 home from this trip! There are about 6 to 7 flavor to choose from, so you may like to walk the park and look out for the popcorn stands!The performances, carry the distinct signature of Disney. It's fun, entertaining, brightly lit and great fun for the family. However it's in Japanese. But we still had fun.A few tips.The Japanese love their Disneyland. Although the doors open at 0900hrs, the queues were already swarming at 0800hrs, easily, 500 to 600 pax were there lining up waiting for the doors to open. Fast Passes are available for the major rides, but they are mostly given out by noon. So be early.  Upon your admission to the park, there is an area in ""Tomorrowland"" next to ""Space Mountain"" where you could try your luck in obtaining seats for the night performance. Use your ticket ""like fast pass"" and if you are lucky, you will get premium seats allocated for the night firework performance. This is Free. One point to note is that most stuff are in Japanese, do have a little patience and seek help. The service staff are very helpful. The night firework is beautiful, so do stay till the very end."
1977,5,15-Dec,United States,Disney Fans not disappointed,We are Disney fanatics. We love Disney World and were really happy to visit here.  It was very crowded but great none the less.  The tower of terror and the Jacks Haunted Mansion were different and a lot of fun.  It was like a new park altogether.  Also the park itself was totally different.  I recommend going here and to Disney Sea even if you are a tried and true Disney attendee.
1978,4,16-Jan,Australia,Great place! Expect to wait in line ,The place is just great and it is a good experience but if u are wanting to go on all the rides and the best rides it is a hour or two wait. We managed to get on Agee rides but only the lesser ones as we didn't fancy waiting too long. Surprisingly good and drink is cheap but again for the main restaurants expect a long wait we ate at the curry place and the wait wasn't too bad there 
1979,5,15-Jul,N/A,"Fantastic Atmosphere, Huge Crowds","Tokyo Disneyland has all the markings of a Disney park, the castle in the middle, the lands spread out around the hub. What makes it stand out from other Disney parks are the visitors and food.  Japanese Disney fans are on a completely different level, some of them dress head to toe in clothing featuring their favourite characters, others tote around their Duffys, buy them costumes and take pictures of them (of and not with them). All of this makes for a great atmosphere and a completely different Disney experience. Micky waffles and Mickey churros are a staple at Disney parks, but Tokyo Disneyland also had things like Little Green Men Mochi balls and Scrumplings which were not only aesthetically pleasing but tasted amazing. Also, if you like popcorn then be prepared to be constantly trying new flavours and collecting the popcorn containers. The pork rice rolls are also a must try. The only downside I found was that they only allowed you to take one photo with the characters, once they saw you click, they'd send you away."
1980,5,15-Dec,Iran,Excellent place to enjoy,"This place is great great great. definitely 1 full day is not enough to enjoy whole facilities. Many shops many restaurants many activities all in with same theme ""DISNEY"". it was one of the wonderful experience of me. I hope next time I will go to Disney Sea, just near to same place. Better to try on not holidays because sometimes you should stay at queue row for more than 2 hours!"
1981,3,15-Dec,Malaysia,Crowded @ Xmas day!!,"I was here @ Disneyland during xmas eve and @Disneysea during xmas day 2015. Way too much crowd, congested everywhere we go and it got worst after lunch...and by 2pm almost all of the fastpass rides for the more popular rides has closed. Imagine the crowd - At 11.30 am, we managed to get a fastpass for the ""Journey to the center of the earth"" ride that was scheduled for the last hour ride at 9pm!! You can judge how bad is the situation.."
1982,4,15-Mar,N/A,Great place for an experience.,"We were there on a supposedly non-peak period, well there were the crowds, maybe not as many as peak period. Nonetheless, the queuing time isnt as short as we hoped. hahaha..... You probably can get 4-5 rides depending on the length of queue and probably you wouldnt want to spurge on a fast pass. Its a great spot for an outing for a day. Disney Sea is definitely better as its more different than the normal Disney land."
1983,4,15-Nov,Australia,Fun day but no LA,"We had a really fun day out here - but I think the finesse and attention to detail is a little higher at the US versions.  Everything was well presented, neat, tidy and has that Disney feel, but there was something just a little lacking, in my opinion, in comparison to the likes of Disneyland and Magic Kingdom.The evening fireworks were underwhelming, but the show afterwards with the images displayed on the castle (all audio in Japanese, of course :) ) was stunning and well worth staying for and more than made up for the lacklustre fireworks.  I guess the evening firework show at Disneyland is its ""signature"" evening show, where for Tokyo Disneyland its ""signature"" evening show is the projection on the castle."
1984,5,15-Dec,Singapore,Great atmosphere,I am not a fan of crowded places. Tokyo Disneyland was indeed crowded during my visit but I enjoyed myself. Strange but I attributed it to the atmosphere. The crowd here loves Disney hence it was magical-like feeling. That is Tokyo's Disneyland magic... 
1985,5,15-Dec,Malaysia,Amazing Visitors!,"No, I don't mean it was amazing for visitors, I meant it literally, that the visitors themselves were amazing, and I had a surreal sense of euphoria just by watching the patrons there: people in school uniform, Santa Claus costume, sexy Santa costume, Santa helper elf costume, lord of the rings (!?) elf costume, covered in Disney character plush toys, the obligatory Disney character hat gear...I was a bit jaded with Disneyland itself, as it was not much different from other Disneylands. But the enthusiasm and the dedication of the Japanese casts were way up there, maybe even unrivaled.Did I mentioned the visitors? I was excited because they were excited! The best analogy I can think of, is watching a comedy in a theater, and the patrons sitting around you were roaring with laughters. The movie itself was old school, you had seen it before, not that funny even, but your companions' laughters were infectious, and you had a good time because everyone else seemed to be genuinely thoroughly having a good time.That's the difference of Tokyo Disneyland."
1986,2,15-Dec,N/A,Hurry UP and WAIT!,"Very difficult to walk, shop or get on attractions.  The crowd was way too large on December 28, 2015.  Will try to go back during a non-peak season, we were not able to enjoy our time with all the crowds.  "
1987,4,15-Dec,United Kingdom,A Good experience on Christmas day,In Tokyo on Christmas Day and felt this would give us a Christmassy experience in Japan. It did. Easy access by rail from Tokyo station and we arrived just in time for the main Christmas parade. Although the park felt busy the lines weren't massive and the park was well organised. Food lines were longer and for some bizarre reason especially so for popcorn. Thankfully we found a place which sold excellent steamed buns (albeit shaped like Mickey and Minnie Mouse)  at a reasonable price with no lines.
1988,1,15-Dec,Australia,"Queue's, queue's and more queue's","2nd time visiting this place and just a waste of money. There are queue's for the toilets, queue's for food and queue's for the smoking room. And that's without the queue's for the rides that can be up to 2 hours long. We achieved 2 rides in 2 days and paid several hundred dollars for the privilege. The 1st ride broke down and with all announcements in Japanese, we were left sitting in a boat that had stopped in a tunnel and no idea what was going on. We were given a Fast Pass as 'compensation' but with no English translation that it was valid for ONE ride on that day only-how ridiculous. The sheer volume of people allowed into the park is frightening. Barely any staff speak English and I personally would rather poke pins in my eyes than go there again. An epic fail."
1989,4,15-Dec,Malaysia,Disney Fun and Leisure,Have been there during winter break on December. To crowded with all the locals and also foreigners. Maybe because everybody on their winter break.  I have to queue up almost 2 hours just to take ride on Splash Mountain. Better to use Fast Pass for this kind of ride or you will just wasted time waiting for your turn. The park was great for fun activities especially the kids. I did not manage to finish all the rides since to many people and all the line was full. The parade and fireworks was okay. I was expecting more than that. 
1990,5,15-Dec,Singapore,Simply Magical!,This was our 3rd visit in over 2 years. All I can say that it's simply magic the moment you step in. Best to visit during off-peak periods as the queues were long when we visited this time around. We'll be back.
1991,4,15-Jan,Malaysia,You have to spend at least 2 nights here in Tokyo Disneyland!,"It was very crowded and had to queue for a long time. Unless, you'd pay fortune for the VIP fast lane pass."
1992,5,15-Dec,Singapore,Day of fun,"I have been to HK Disneyland. Tokyo Disneyland is a few notches better. Could it be that the Japanese are leaders in robotics? The animations are fantastic ! The amusement park staff are all so friendly and always carry a big smile. Everything is just flawless. Japanese quality control and service are the best. One day is simply not enough especially there are two worlds, land and sea. "
1993,4,15-Jun,Philippines,Fireworks so fantastic!,Fun filled experience but 1 day is really not enough to enjoy this place. I was so glad to have won the ticket for fireworks. I won 6 tickets for the fireworks display however 2 of our Japanese friends could not join us until closing time so I had 2 tickets extra. I saw a baby girl with her mother and I gave them the 2 extra tickets I had but at first the guards did not allow it. So I had to ask my friend to secretly hand it to the mother outside as I really pity the child seeing her so excited to see the fireworks and thank God it works! The fireworks display was fantastic! I thought I saw the best one in Hong Kong but here is more high end. Really world class!
1994,4,15-Dec,Singapore,Similar to other theme parks,Thought I would really enjoy a trip to Disneyland but it was similar to other theme parks like Universal Studios. Decided to leave the park by early evening as I was bored and the night was cold.  Would have loved to see the fireworks display but decided not to wait as there was nothing interesting to do.
1995,4,15-Dec,Japan,"Great Time, crazy Popcorn Flavors","Stayed here over Christmas 2015.  Superb time and the crowds were large but, very orderly and disciplined.  The popcorn lines were up to 20-minutes and the Flavors were very unique.  All in all a must for avid Disney fans."
1996,2,15-Dec,Singapore,Fast pass is useless on a Sunday,"My family and I have been to Disneysea last June and thought why not try Disneyland this time round. We didn't want to book the ticket online earlier before we flew off to Tokyo because we were unsure of which day we were going to be free for Disney.Anyway, when we finally got down to deciding, it was a Saturday and not having easy access to a printer, I thought my not go to Takashimaya Shinjuku Disney Shop to purchase the park tickets. We were staying around that area anyway. Alas, upon arriving, they informed me via a notice in English saying that the park tickets can only be purchased at 2 Disney shops - at Ikebukuro and Shibuya. Having not been to ikebukuro, we decided to make an afternoon visit there. Upon arriving at the shop, we were made to take a number and according to the ""helpful"" Disney staff, based on my number, they would be able to serve me in about a matter of 2 hours - yes 2 hours! A tip for people intending to visit Disneyland in Japan - decide on a date early and buy your tickets online! So more ice cream for my boys as we shop around and waited 2 hours just to purchase 5 park tickets. We also saw a sign that Disneysea tickets were fully sold out for the next day too. Thank goodness going to Disneysea wasn't in our plans!Upon arriving (it was a Sunday), there were queues just about everywhere. My boys wanted space mountain first and guess what, the queue was going to be 140 minutes! And the fast pass ticket booth showed that they were available at 1.15 to 2.15pm. So we took that. And because of that, we were not able to take any more fast pass until 2 hours later! By that time, the only fast passes were for rides beyond 7-8pm in the evening. Most rides had a waiting time of between 90 to 140 minutes. The few that didn't were the Mississippi boat and it's a small world. We were fortunate to manage to get into pirates of the carribean rude and the wait was only about 20-30 minutes then as we were early. And then we did the haunted mansion. That took about 45 minutes. And then we finally had the space mountain ride, along with the teacup, Pinocchio, it's a small world and the Mississippi boat. With queues just about everywhere, I think we did quite a good job, really!Lunch time was horrendous. Queues snaked outside of the restaurants. Food was alright but the joy of biting into one's food was completely wiped out after the trauma of having to queue so long just to order and pay for your food. Guess what - there were even queues for popcorns and turkey legs. We only managed to get some popcorns during the parade when everyone was focused on looking at the parade.Given a chance to reconsider, I would have chosen a weekday go visit the park and would have purchased the tickets online. Having been to both Tokyo Disneysea and Disneyland, my family and I are unanimous in our votes that Disneysea was a much better experience. It felt different and we really remembered the experience with fondness. For Disneyland Tokyo, it will take me a while to get over the shock and trauma from all the queueing. Instead of being the happiest place for us, it was the worst with the longest queues...."
1997,4,15-Dec,Australia,Fun filled days at our first Disney Theme Park but be prepared for crowds,We had a fun filled day at both Disneyland and DisneySea.  We spent one day in each and that was not enough to see everything.  Be prepared to wait in a queue.  We spent most of our time (especially in Disney Sea) in a line waiting.  There is a fast pass system which is free where you can scan your entry ticket and then a fast pass ticket prints out giving you an express line at a given time later in the day.  You can only have one fast pass ticket at a time so we found that we got there at 10am and our first pass may give us a ride between 1 and 2 so then by 1pm the next fast pass ride may not be available til the evening.  Still gave us a few rides with less wait time.  Obviously all commentary on rides and shows are in Japanese. Don't expect any rides for thrill seekers...they are all very fantasy based and tame.  We had a lovely couple of days there and enjoyed our first taste of a Disney theme park.
1998,5,15-Dec,China,Wonderful ,"We've been to Hong Kong Disney a year ago and we were happy to see that attraction are not exactly the same. The park was really clean and all personnel very kind, always smiling. Sure it is crowded and you need to queue on most of attraction but you can't expect a Disney park to be empty.Even though it was holiday, we found it well organize with minimum queuing time.Regards to transportation, very easy access from Tokyo Station by JR.It cost 220 JPY for an adult. That's really great. JR station 300 meters from the park entrance.While visiting Tokyo with kids, even adults, it is a great place to go."
1999,4,15-Nov,Australia,Packed but still fun,Entrance fee was 6900 yen each. There were lots of people and waiting time for each ride was 1 to 1 and a half hours. I was able to ride the Pirates of the Caribbean and It's a small world. The day & night parade were spectacular. Food was expensive. I paid 1800 yen for a set meal. I had fun and I would like to be back someday.
2000,4,15-Dec,N/A,Enjoy my visit,"Nice but the q is terrible.Spending time to q. Didn't manage to finish all rides. Expect to have firework but didn't see it. Not sure is it because it was raining...overall, it's better than disneysea."
2001,5,15-Dec,Canada,Best run Disneyland ,This Disney is pretty typical of all the amusement parks but what sets it apart is the service. The service is second to none and Disney Parks should try and implement this level of service at all their parks. 
2002,5,15-Dec,Singapore,"The Happiest Place on Earth, Indeed!","When Disneyland was labeled as the happiest place on earth, it is without a doubt it is so very aptly named! Regardless of age, one becomes a child all over again the moment you step through the gates of Disneyland.The size of the park is vast but easy to navigate. English literate guests should visit the Guest Services office upon entry to the park to obtain maps printed in English. The maps available at the turnstiles cater to Japanese, Chinese and Korean literates.Needless to say, everything is in Japanese inside the park. We're in Japan! Characters speak Japanese, shows are in Japanese, parades and performances are in Japanese. The good thing is instructions for rides are also available in English and menu at eateries are also available in English.Food served in the park is generally nice and too pretty to be eaten. Although, prices are much pricier than the outside.The rides in the park are mild but very enjoyable. Guests with certain medical and physical conditions should ask the ride attendants and read ride warnings carefully before taking the ride. Fast Passes are fairly easy to obtain at the designated rides. We had a very pleasant experience with one of the park staff at a ride when we realized we were one Fast Pass short because we had scanned a same passport twice while at the machines. She was polite and patient and ensured us that it is alright as she arranged for her colleagues further inside the ride to admit us altogether despite the missing Fast Pass. Well-done, Tokyo Disneyland! We are so coming back again!"
2003,3,15-Dec,Australia,First and last visit,"We spent an evening at Disneyland on the first night of arrival and a full day each at Disneysea and Disneyland. Whilst both were beautiful parks with attention to detail, it was overrun with local teens and young couples on dates on the quest for the best selfies. They contribute to the colossal queues on popular rides up to 2-3 hours wait time making it really hard if you have little ones in tow who neither have the patience or stamina. I'm sure being the holiday season doesn't help so I would avoid during this time of year. Even with 8-10 hours each day we missed on a fair few attractions Get there early! We arrived at 8am on both days and there were large crowds already. Workout your Fastpast tickets. There are limits to how many you can get and when you can get them. Free but sell out fast!!!!! My husband would run off and get them while the kids and I went to another attraction. We lucked out on must-see-for-kids Toy Story Mania and Monsters Inc with 2 hour waits by mid morning and sold out fast past tickets. Disappointing!!!! Everything is in Japanese which I found really off putting. I've only just learnt from a fellow reviewer that there is a translation tool you can get to help subtitle. I wished I'd known earlier but my 5yo can't quite read yet. Disneysea was unlike anything I'd ever seen.  Being a designer and an event stylist, the sets and scene were stunning. From the moment you walk in there's the Mediterranean Harbour with a fortress and ship my kids loved exploring. I'm 41 and my fave character is the little mermaid so the mermaid lagoon was stunning.. My young kids loved it. We got there early so they got on all the rides with ease. The rides are suitable for toddlers. There's even a playgym. Must ride  at Disneyland- Splash Mountain at Critter Country. It's new so I assume updated from what you would have seen at Anaheim. Food and beverage selections were average and limited. There are popular flavored popcorn stands. You can get these refillable take home popcorn tubs. They are character themed. I was after the rare R2D2 unit but of course it sold out. This is the one to covet!!!Workout your souvenirs early on. By closing time, it's a mess - total bedlam. I'm unsure if I will ever be back. It wasn't as great an experience I had hoped. Wear comfy shoes because it'll be a long, long day. I've seen the ever-so-vain Jap girls in ridiculous platforms. Happy queuing!!! "
2004,3,15-Dec,Malaysia,Tokyo-Hokkaido,Arrived early in the morning after breakfast via Tokyo subway and the place were already crowded on a normal weekday! Maybe because of Christmas holidays that the place was packed with tourists and locals. Definitely a place of attraction for children with all Disney cartoons characters marching around the place.
2005,4,15-Dec,Singapore,Great Fun!,"Spent a full day at the Tokyo Disneyland, which is one of my favorite places to go whenever I'm in Tokyo with the family. This is our fourth visit to the park. This year we went before Christmas and the queues and waiting time weren't as bad. The period between Christmas Eve to New Year's Day is absolutely the worst time to go as the waiting times become 3-4 hours and the park gets too crowded. Even waiting to buy popcorn and food takes an hour. "
2006,4,15-Apr,Philippines,Review:  Shinjuku Century Southern Tower Hotel to Disney,"Too much crowd and the queue was SUPER LONG. Some takes up to 3 hours!This review is about transfer options to and from Shinjuku using bus or train. I stayed at Century Southern Tower Hotel. Bus:  The JR Expressway bus station is almost just next to Takashimaya (5-10 mins leisure walk). From the hotel, go to 2nd floor. When outside, go across the bridge to Takashimaya then turn right and follow the sign of JR Expressway Bus. The bus going to Disney has a certain time in the morning and late afternoon. Pls check disney website. The bus ticket is purchased at a special Disney vending machine. Adult: 820 Yen/way. Child: 410 Yen/way We took the 8:40am bus. Bus leaves on time. On the way we encounter traffic, thus it took us more than one hour to reach Disney. Pros:  no need transfers.  Cons:  If bus is full, have to wait for the next. A friend of ours encounter that problem when coming back from Disneyland. Returning bus normally picks up passenger from Disneysea first before Disneyland. So one might have to catch another bus if the bus is full of passengers from Disneysea. Taxi:  Since the friend of ours does not want to wait for another hour catching a bus from Disneyland back to Shinjuku, they took a taxi which cost them 10,000 Yen one way. Train:  I wanted to experience taking train.  So I took train on my return from Disneyland to Shinjuku. (Note:  Maihama Train station is 5-10 mins leisure walk from Disneyland. It is near Disneyland but NOT near Disneysea. One might have to ride the Disney monorail which cost I think 250 yen/way from Disneysea to the Maihama train Station). The train route i choose/use:-One can choose to transfer at Tokyo station. But I DID NOT go through Tokyo station transfer because I read transferring from a JR owned train to KEIO owned train needs around 1km walk. And probably won't be able to get any seat on the train. I choose instead to transfer at Shin-Kiba station (a small uncomplicated station) to Rinkai/Saikyo Line (eventhough owned by different company but no need transfer ie direct connection). From Maihama to Shin-Kiba, the train was quite full (at 6:15pm). From Shin-Kiba to Shinjuku we manage to get seats. It stopped at around 5-6 stations which gradually filled up the train.  Cost us 790 yen / adult /way. Not sure how much is child because we bought Adult suica card. In order to buy Child suica card, we need to show passport which i left in hotel. Pros:  Flexible time and a little cheaper. Cons:  One just need time to study how the train/subway system works. Once understand, it is SUPER easy, cheap and efficient way to travel.We bought Suica card for convenience. 500 yen deposit was required but refundable once card was return. According to the Suica brochure. The refund works this way:-1). If there are remaining balance in the card, for example 1,000 yen, the refund will be 780 yen (1000 - 220 handling fee) + 500 yen deposit = 1,280 yen will be refunded. 2). If remaining balance is 100 yen, there will be no refund. Only the 500 yen deposit will be refunded. 3). If remaining balance is 0 yen, here will be no refund. Only the 500 yen will be refunded. Hope this tips helps. "
2007,3,15-Dec,N/A,Disneyland is supposed to be the happiest place on earth?,"I was still filled with excitement when we were journeying to Tokyo Disneyland, this feeling slowly thinned out, albeit not fully, when we walked through the gates and I saw this huge crowd. Not having been there in a few years, it certainly was a different scene.Therefore, I would strongly suggest that should you wish to visit it, try to avoid doing so on a weekend and public holidays. I am told that even during a working week day or school day, somehow the locals are there in large numbers.The locals totally support this theme park and will freely spend on souvenirs, food and what not.The queues for rides and for food, even popcorn, were ridiculously long as we there on a Saturday.Other than that, it is still the happiest place on earth.The parades still brought lots of smiles and spread lots of cheer!"
2008,4,15-Dec,Singapore,Always magical to visit Disneyland,"Although as the children gets older, the rides and attractions are less interesting to them, Disney still retains its magical feel and touch to make anyone in the park very much an excited child. Despite the fact that the shows and rides were also spoken in Japanese, we learned on this trip that we could take a portable translator tool that help us subtitled the content of the shows (apparently, not many people are aware of this since I only saw my son carrying this device and everyone marveling at the tool including the Japanese!). With two families in tow, the one who extracted the best value for the theme park was my 6 year old since the older kids generally only took the so called ""scarier"" rides only. Magical show at the night over the castle and all round tired when the park closed at 10pm. Worth a visit every time regardless of age."
2009,3,15-Dec,N/A,Get ready to line up for everything,"The queue is long for everything. Even though  everyone follows the rules and order it does gets to you if you have to queue up for everything inside the theme park. From food to rides to restrooms. Do spend 2 days there if you want to cover all rides and shows. Most if the time spend was for queueing for things. I travelled there with 2 children under the age of 10 and 2 elderly folks. I admit I do have to take it slow. I was there during a weekday. It was packed with tourist and locals too. Remember this, but as long as you start queuing you will get there. Happy queuing.  "
2010,5,15-Jun,New Zealand,So Much Fun!,"We went outside of the holidays but it was still very busy. Food was well priced and we didnt wait to long at most of the rides. Loved the parade, it was an Easter one and my Daughter loves rabbits so she was thrilled. Can't wait to go visit Paris Disney next year!"
2011,4,15-Dec,N/A,"Great for Family, Kids, Couple... For Everyone!","As expected - the fusion of interesting cultures of Japan and the Disneyland created a wonderful memory for me and my family. You can see many high spirited people buying Tokyo Disneyland's merchandises and using it right away without any hesitation at all! For example, you can see people wearing a funny green and blue Monster Inc hoodie with three eyes on top. Even if let say you (feel) old and is just coming to Tokyo Disneyland to accompany your family, it is a very interesting sight to see how the Japanese and foreigners enjoy their day here in Tokyo Disneyland! If you are planning to come here, never ever feel old or shy to be young!Because in Tokyo Disneyland, everyone becomes a child again and is a place where dreams come true ;)"
2012,5,15-Dec,Malaysia,Awesome as expected,"We've went to the one in Paris and I personally thinks that this one is even better (the one in Paris was awesome too so I'm not sure how it was even possible to be more awesome :))I'm 34 but in Disneyland I'm 34 going on 4. Hehe. We were travelling with our 2.5 years old son, who seems to also had so much fun (in between his naps).We were surprised that there were quite a lot of attractions to cater for his age too. Be warn the queues are indeed long so we did not really bother covering all rides even the ones without height restriction.Still super awesome. Highly recommended! Two thumbs up."
2013,5,15-Dec,Singapore,Disneyland over DisneySea,"I love this place and this time round we managed to get a few fastpasses for some rides. Even though it was really crowded, the fastpass gave us access without the need to queue again. The worse queue we did was Monster Inc (70mins) and I didn't feel it was worth it. Star wars was great! Snitch was cute though we didn't understand a single word of what's going on. We had a great long day there."
2014,5,15-Nov,United States,A great visit to one of the best Disney theme parks,"We had a great experience at Tokyo Disneyland. We spent one day there (Friday) and the day before at Tokyo Disney Sea (Thursday). We purchased our tickets the night before at the hotel we were staying at (Sheraton Grande Tokyo Bay) so we wouldn't have to stand in line to buy tickets the next morning.  We got a late start, which I don't recommend as the lines only get longer as the day goes on, and got in the park at around 10am. We went straight to Monster's Inc. to get a Fast Pass and the return time was already past 5pm, then straight to Pooh's Hunny Hunt.  That was our longest wait of the day, maybe 65-70 minutes.  The rest of the day, we grabbed FP's and were able to ride everything we wanted with minimal wait.  We also watched the Dreamlights Parade which was awesome and a part of the show where they project animation onto the castle (also awesome).  We had dinner at Queens of Hearts restaurant and although the food was okay, the theming was amazing, especially the stained glass window.  I would suggest not going to the shops right before closing, which is what we did, because it was packed with people wanting to buy that last souvenir.  We had a great time at TDR and TDS and can't wait to go back."
2015,3,15-Dec,Australia,All about Fast Pass Management...,"Here's a review I wanted to see before heading to Tokyo Disneyland. With tips üòâGetting thereRecommend EARLY! The park ticket office opens 7am for an 8am park open and the locals will be there well before that! Recommend getting there at 6:30am to beat the majority of the lines. LONG wait but you'll get a head start on fast passes! Fast PassesMachines are at each fast pass ride and dispense one ticket per person.Fast Pass Plan of AttackBest way to attack this is send one person with whole family's tickets to the ride you want to get your first fast pass for. The rest of the family lines up at the next ride. You then need to make sure you're getting a fast pass for the next ride on the dot of it becoming available. Available time is listed on your current fast pass. Park ItselfIt's honestly a bit of a let down for the thrill-seeker (like me) the most thrilling ride is probably space mountain. A roller coaster in the dark. TD is Very much a kid park. There was a lack of Disney characters walking around which was surprising... There may have been some but we didn't see them. That said, the parade was pretty special but be prepared to sit or stand behind everyone sitting. Merchandise Lousy! Don't expect much in the way of variety or quality with the exception of the crystal store and some cool pots and teacups. FoodVery well priced! You can have lunch for $10each inc drinks. Recommend the pizza place for this. Churro and popcorn lines are insane! Forget about them! If you happen to come across one with 3 or less people buy for the sake of the miracle that it is. We saw most lines exceed 60 people. The Japanese are a patient bunch that's for sure! CrowdsOh my god!!!! Crowds are insane. There were many times we found ourselves unable to negotiate paths around people because there were that many! SummaryOverall it was an OK park but a bit of a let-down for adults without kids. I'd choose USJ in Osaka over this park but I'm glad I can cross it off my list."
2016,5,15-Dec,Australia,You definitely need a FULL day it this magical place!,"If you love Disney this is the place. The atmosphere, music, actors and people are great. We got there for 8am and there was no line for tickets, about 100 people in front of us for entry. I would definitely recommend going to the ride you most want to go on first as some fast passes run out by the afternoon. You can also only have one fast pass per time slot. There is a lot of people sitting and waiting for parades all day long so you can still see them once they start, just walk up behind the sitters. We have a three year old who loved Tom Sayer Island. A great, LONG, day but worth every minute. Food is cheap compared to Australian standard also. You pay for novelty food like popcorn buckets ($23) but meals are cheap. "
2017,5,15-Dec,Canada,Still the happiest place on earth,"Well so to speak. There are other Disney parks around the world but this is the nearest to me in terms of accessibility. You can never go wrong with Disney I guess. Still there is some room for improvement with regards to lines and queueing. Their fast pass is just an adjustment for you to come back at a different time. Maybe a similar style like universal studios Japan wherein you have to pay extra to get thru faster via an express lane. I wouldn't mind paying extra on top of the entrance pass fee as long as I don't have to keep falling in line for a fastpass then again at the fast pass lane cuz a lot also got it. Still, no complaints. Just don't go on a weekend here. It's pandemonium. But on a weekday, it's manageable. One piece of advice....... Go early. As in opening of gates. Merry Christmas everyone!"
2018,3,15-Dec,Singapore,Cold Disney,"We went with 2 young children,  one still in stroller. This is not our first Disney trip so we know the queuing time and how Japanese love the Disney parade.We went on a Thursday and the average q time for most attractions are 15 to 30mins. Those popular ones require 60mins which we didn't try cos it is cold in winter.  I watched the parade with my girl in stroller however I was asked to close my stroller repeatedly which I told them I couldn't as my girl needs to sit in the stroller to watch the parade.  By the 4th time,  the staff asked me to get out of the sitting area,  rather rudely.  Maybe it is a miscommunication or a difficult in perishing herself in proper English,  I still find it rude to talk to me with a young toddler on hand in that situation.  The parade was just seconds away.  I fumbled and just bring out my toddler and leave the pram sideways. After this bad experience, I was still in shock and didn't really enjoy the rest of the day. So be prepared to collapse your stroller if you are having one in disneyland Tokyo. "
2019,2,N/A,N/A,Disney,"I think other Disney different.and this Tokyo Disney really different ,there was Disneyland and Disney sea  , it was everything from sea and it catchy because the colorful and design .. And there is many character .. I hope next time to stay at Disney hotel I am curious to know and what will be Disney at night    Because I miss the show I was exhausted."
2020,5,15-Jan,United Kingdom,Best attractions ever ..love ha Japan,"What a beautiful place ...:) 2parks DisneyLand and Disneysea are just amazing. I enjoyed myself and also my friends. Love Tokyo and I will be back again . Loads of attractions, show is amazing. People are very friendly . Looking forward to take my partners there . "
2021,4,15-Dec,Singapore,Queues everywhere!,"You would start queueing in the morning, even before entering the gates of Disbeyland. There is a fastpass system but even that requires some queuing and waiting for you timing. The Q for non fast pass rides seem to start from a min of 30min but gets better later in the day where people starts gathering in front of the castle for fireworks.That said, with proper planning, getting fastpass for popular rides as early as possible and running to get the next one whenever you are eligible, you may still be able to cover most of the popular rides. I didn't manage to do it but apparently ny brother did."
2022,4,15-Dec,Australia,Great family visit,Great visit for family. Recommend arriving early to beat the lines. Go to FastPass rides first to face track the queues. Heaps of rides for the kids and adults. A must visit place if in Tokyo.
2023,5,15-Dec,Singapore,I'll be back!,"This is probably my 4th visit. I still cannot get enough of this place. The park is very well maintained even after more than 10 years since my last visit. The day of our visit, which is a weekday, is not very crowded, I guess. We only took 2 fast passes, one each for Pooh's Hunny Hunt ride and Monster Inc. Ride and Go Seek. Waiting time for popular rides were mostly under 1 hour. The longest we waited was 50 minutes. So, it is good to avoid public holidays, local school holidays and weekends.My 6 yo son thinks that he has more fun in Tokyo Disneyland than USJ. At the end of the day, he said, ""I love Tokyo Disneyland!"". We will surely to go back for more."
2024,1,15-Mar,Japan,"Very crowded, long queues for rides and food, mainly junk food and not like LA Disneyland at all","Very crowded, long queues for rides and food, mainly junk food and not like LA Disneyland at all. I lasted one hour and then left  "
2025,5,15-Dec,Malaysia,Must visit!!,"1 day is not enough! We missed 2 themes. even though fastpass entrance provided, the waiting time is still long. Fastpass opening ticket should be shorter. Pls make it 1 hour instead of 2 hours. We stayed here from morning until they closed but still cannot complete. For family with kids, make sure to see all show and bring more clothes. More money spent here coz lot of varieties of merchandise sold here. The last show was the memorable. We totally enjoyed our time spent here and wish to come again."
2026,4,15-Dec,Singapore,Use Fast Pass,"Fun day. Please be prepared to Queues . whether is food kiosk , rides, restaurants and some time even toilets. Love Disney at Japan, as everything is order and clean. Lots of places which you can refill drinking water. More interactive rides which my kids love it better than Disneysea."
2027,3,15-Nov,N/A,Suitable for children but not for adult!,Disneyland! Of course we'll imagine magical things like childrens. Yes all the rides there are amazing but for children. For adult its average i think. 1 thing that i can compliment is the decoration is superb.
2028,3,15-Nov,Malaysia,Just too many people,"We took a train to Mahaima Station and you can see Disneyland the moment you get off. It was a Sunday and it was also very very crowded. Tip: do purchase entry tickets before you arrive. Luckily we did, as the park was closed to visitors who didnt already have tickets. People were turned away and told to come back only at 5pm. It would dark already by then and the park closes at 8pm. There were just too many people there and there were long queues everywhere, to the toilets, to purchase food and to go on rides. etc The parades were good to watch, day and night parades. The fireworks was nothing special, quite ordinary in fact."
2029,4,15-Dec,Netherlands,a very happy place indeed,"this is my third Disneyland after Florida and Hong Kong. Its a proper full size park with all the major rides. Tuesday was much less crowded than Wednesday so cant imagine what the weekend crowd would be like. We tried both the express bus from Shinjuku as well as the subway/train. the bus is more comfortable without having to change lines but the Japanese trains are faultless in punctuality. we enjoyed the Pooh bear and Monsters Inc rides with our 9 yr old girl and the Star wars ride is great too. the parades happening throughout the day were fun to watch, but the cancellation of the fireworks show due to inclement weather (which i didnt think so) was a disappointment. the staff at the park were super dedicated, always helpful and never failed to smile. for Muslim travellers there is the queen of hearts resto in the Fantasyland which has a pork free menu and has a nice fish and seafood item. Sadly it is not quite halal certified yet.shops wise it has the full range of items on sale, although it feels a bit disorganised and designs/choices are limited for certain types of memorabilia like T shirts (maybe its winter) and things like fridge magnets, not a major deal."
2030,5,15-Dec,Philippines,Tokyo Disneyland! Where you always find the kid in you!,"We visited the famous Tokyo Disneyland! The theme park opens at 8:00 am and closes around 10:00 pm.  I suggest you plan your trip beforehand.  Know which rides or shows which you want to see or ride, research what times are the shows, and get fast pass in order for you to maximize your visit! Watch the parade, and the fireworks display!"
2031,4,15-Dec,Singapore,Definitely a beautiful park,"Disneyland is always every girls' dream! My 2 girls enjoyed it even my Husband!I been to the one in Hong Kong. So I can only make comparisons between the two.We took trains from Shinjuku station where a transfer is needed.... Transferred was a bit too much to walk... I bought the tickets online to save time on queuing. But ended up we went in the late morning where there isn't any queue.This is a cute and beautiful park with so many cute decorations. The biggest problem is sure to be the queue... Wasted a lot of time queuing... Managed to get a fast pass... Realised it too late... So overall we only get to enjoy about 6-7 rides... Love the parades (day and night), the firework... But not so on the screening after firework... Maybe because we do not understand Japanese... Of course not to forget the popcorn bucket... My girls were Super excited! Didn't get to buy lots of Disney gifts. Thinking that I can get it the next day at Disneysea. However, Disneysea has limited but a little bit different sets of Disney gifts. We shopped in the gift shop almost before the park closure and managed to stay in the shops till 10:30pm... Lastly, checked on the weather before you go... If tickets aren't bought online. I bought it online few days before I travelled, weather forecast was accurate...Try to stay in a nearby hotel if you planned to go both Parks... Travelling throu and fro twice is no joke... "
2032,4,15-Nov,Australia,A life experience ,"The park itself is great. The cast members are fantastic but what else would you expect from Disney. The weather was cold, but I like cold so perfect. The one negative, and I can't believe I am saying this, there wasn't enough varied merchandise.  I wanted to purchase a nice Disney jacket or cardigan, both of which I have previously purchased at WDW but there was nothing other than a handful of very (ugly) sweatshirts. The park was very busy but we expected that. Definitely an experience but one I probably wouldn't repeat in a hurry. Two days will well and truly be enough at this park regardless of crowd numbers"
2033,5,15-Dec,Spain,Disney Japanese Style,"Great park that's similar enough to other Disney parks but different enough to be a refreshing change.Don't miss Pooh's Honey Hunt and Monsters Inc. attractions as they either unique to the park or sufficiently different enough to justify the wait - use a FastPass if you can.The organisation here is great and the parades very well organised with Cast Members ensuring everyone is respectful and not blocking other guests views of the parades. This park can get very, very busy so plan ahead, arrive early and use FastPass."
2034,5,15-Nov,Singapore,Best Disneyland,"The place is fantastic! It is very buzzy and there are mostly local! They are well self-organised. Better experience than those parks in USA. For viewing of Parade, front crowd is always sitting! Amazing self-discipline!The day and night Parade are awesome! Best Show ever!"
2035,5,15-Nov,Canada,Florida in Japan,Great park and experience.  Poohs Hunny Pot is a great rid  for all ages and get their early because Fastpasses go faster than in the states. SpaceMountain was great and go in early and to the right to get Monsters Inc or else you'll miss out.  
2036,4,15-Nov,Singapore,Most Popular Disneyland!!,"The world's 2nd most visited park, means one can expected huge turnout around the year, queue can be extremely long so need to plan ahead for rides and need to maximize the usage of fastpass. Popcorn is very popular and comes with various favour. Try the soy sauce and butter, something unique but tasty. If budget allow, try to stay at one of the Disney's hotel which comes with the perks of going to the park 15 minutes earlier, where you can rush to get a fastpass for one of the popular ride and queue for another."
2037,5,15-Dec,Pakistan,disneyland,"i visit in train to disneyland, its 5 min in train and you can also go by walk, its too near.but i must say that the disneyland is the next door neighbor to this hotel "
2038,5,15-May,Indonesia,The best place for children,"I've visited this place with my daughters 6yo and 4yo. They've so much fun, they met disney's prince and princess. The place is very huge, lot of attractive games for my children and me LOL. We love the parade especially their electrical parade and the closing performance at cinderella castle with fireworks and spotlight"
2039,5,15-Dec,United Kingdom,Good Theme Park,"My first trip to a major theme park and I enjoyed it.  Took a while to get used to the fastpass system but I got on every thing I wanted to do.  Once you get used to the fastpass system I bet you could do even more.  It helps that the park is open early till late.Its good that the fastpass system is fair and included within the admission price unlike other theme parks where you have to pay more for the express ticket.The parades were really good with everyones favourite characters.  The rides didnt seem tired maybe thats because it was my first visit or maybe because the rides like splash mountain arent related to a film that came out decades ago.  Staff were super friendly and helpful though more english throughtout the park would be helpful to western visitors.Read up on what the popular rides are, where they are and what time they open before you get there so that you can utilise every minute.  And make sure youre there early otherwise youll be queing behind lots of people just to get in."
2040,5,15-Nov,Japan,Magic Kingdom,Visiting almost every year and still it is fun every time! Parades are awesome!The only disadvantage long lines sometimes ...
2041,4,15-Feb,Australia,"Fun day, long lines.","Came about 1 hour after opening time and the lines to buy tickets were enormous. As we went in to get our fast pass, most of them had be taken for the best rides. Overall there are many rides which are family friendly, but most have a 2-3 hour wait. There are also many shows and parades throughout the day which makes for a good break between rides. The electric show at night was spectacular and is definitely something you don't want to miss. The food was expensive so probably best to bring snacks to save. Overall a fun day, not many thrill seeking rides and very family friendly."
2042,5,15-Nov,United States,Recommende but similar to Magic Kingdom/Disneyland,Smaller than Disneyland Anaeheim and with less rides.  Still different enough to warrant a visit if you like theme parks or a Disney fan.  Great people watching if you come from a western country.
2043,5,15-Oct,Taiwan,3 days in both parks with two girls aged 4 and 6,"My husband and I waited long until going to a Disneypark with our kids. We wanted them to be old enough to remember and cherish the memory.Since we are currently living in Taiwan, we had to choose between Hongkong and Tokyo. Lot's of people recommended Tokyo over Hongkong because of it's exceptional cleanness. We did not make the wrong decision! We booked the tickets online first. One day Disneyland, one day Disney Sea, third day we were able to choose one from both.Access is very convenient if staying inside Disney Resort. The Monorail takes you directly to the park entrances. The parks are crowded, yes. But thst is the case anywhere in the world. Due to the possibility of getting Fastpasses for certain attractions, it is very well organized. The food offered at both parks is reasonably priced and very wide ranged.With little kids, we preferred the Disneyland. Disney Sea's attractions are mostly suitable for older kids from, I would say, 12 years of age. It is still beautiful to see though. So we spent two of our three days st Disneyland and enjoyed our trip a lot!Come during the week though! We went Tuesday to Thursday and it was crowded. I heared it is even more crowded during the weekends! "
2044,5,15-Nov,Australia,Must go on a week day ,You must go on a week day if you can as the weekends are super busy. The Japanese Disney's seem to let a lot more people in compared to other Disney's.  I think this is because the Japanese are so patient and will never push so it works well. 
2045,4,15-Dec,Singapore,Crowded but manageable,"Entered the park once it opened. Not as crowded as we had expected. Would be able to  take most of the rides if you utilise the fastpass well. The rides were more suitable for kids aged between 3 to 6. However, the park is still very well maintained. Foodwise a lot of varieties. Most enjoyable ride in disneyland tokyo was the haunted mansion. "
2046,4,15-Dec,Malaysia,Great First-time Experience..!,"Wonderful time here.. It was crowded and there were lines almost at every attraction but kudos to all the staff.. They were efficient, polite and systematic. It was a quick wait.. The restrooms were clean and smelling fresh even with the great influx of visitors. Special thanks to the sanitation staff who kept the restrooms clean..! "
2047,5,15-Oct,Malaysia,My dreamland,Have been to HK Disneyland. But Tokyo Disneyland truly impressed me. Everything is good just too crowded. I definitely will bring my kids to go again.
2048,2,15-Dec,Australia,Mediocre at best,"The lines for the rides at Disney Tokyo are much less then the Disney Sea, but then again, ride variety is very limited. 3 rides (in my opinion) are with going on - the train ride, space mountain and the thunder mountain. The rides overall are mediocre at best - with no roller coasters or Ferris wheels like the USA Disney. Not so bad if you have young ones - several rides and shows are more aimed at kids. We got through all the main rides and a few kiddy rides in a matter of a little over 4 hrs. On the plus side, the park is laid out well and the food is surprisingly fairly well priced. However, on top of admission, there is also an additional charge of 630yen per day to use the monorail to the Disney resort hotels even if you are staying as a guest! Personally, I would not go out of my way to return. Money is better spent elsewhere in Tokyo. If you do attend the park, would recommend going at night to see the light shows as they were pretty impressive - in fact, better than the rides themselves."
2049,3,15-Nov,Singapore,Crowded Disneyland,"Bought the Disneyland ticket in my own country. Went on Sat, 8am and there's already huge crowds everywhere. Queued to go into the park. Installed the real time Tokyo Disney apps in my mobile phone and it's a breeze to know all the waiting time and fast pass duration, Look at those short waiting time and dashed over. Managed to go to 14 attractions (rides/shows etc). Average waiting time is 35min. With fast pass, is much shorter timing. Hence, those attractions showing shorter duration, Some show waiting time is 5min, need not queue for long. Went on board Mark Twain Riverboat at night, was cold weather but great view. Went twice to the Pirates of the Caribbean. Many rides are very family and children oriented.if you are looking for very excitng, extremely high speed, challenging long duration roller coaster, unlikely to find. Restaurants are packed especially during meal time. We went after 2pm to Tomorrow Land Terrance and had Mickey bread sandwiches, managed to get seats. The parades are very intriguing and colorful. There are many different theme parades the entire day.Especially impressed with the service of the ground staff/ushers/cleaning crew. Whenever we asked for directions, they will definitely pull out the Disney park map and direct you clearly. They served with pride and passion."
2050,3,15-Nov,Philippines,Crowded,Nice place..but very crowded esp during holidays and weekend. You have to wait for minimum of 1 hr just for  single ride. The parade is great. 
2051,4,15-Sep,Australia,Dreams coming true waiting 1 hour in rides line,As awesome as it was just to be in Disneyland I would definetly not go there for the rides considering I waited for an hour to go on one and it really wasn't that great. Infact I wouldnt bother going on them at all your probably better off just enjoying the park itself and the other random things you can do there.
2052,3,15-Nov,N/A,Crowds crowds crowds! ,"We visited the park at the end of November. Park is easy to get to (we stayed in Shinjuku). Monorail is easy to use to get to the park. We bought tickets on the door which was pretty easy considering the women didn't speak very good English! I have been to Disney land Paris and Disney world in Florida so I knew what to expect. The park is clean and tidy. Now onto the bad part. I have never seen a theme park so busy in my life! You could honestly not walk easily around the park. The queues for rides were ridiculous we got on 5 rides when there were many more we wanted to do but didn't get the chance. You can get a fast pass for some rides but there are so many given out for each hour of the day that your time to use it would be at a stupid time when you would probably be on your way home! It would be easier to just sell fast pass tickets as extras as I wouldn't of minded paying an extra ¬£40 if that meant I got on all the rides. If I'm being honest when I come back to Japan I will not be going back to Disney land as the crowds were a major off put and did kind of spoil our day. When lunch time comes around trying to find food or a seat is impossible! We queued for half and hour for a pizza then had to sit by some bins to eat it! We spent half our day at Disney land and the other half at Disney sea, which had just as many big queues and over crowding! "
2053,5,15-Jun,Philippines,Where dreams come true -- especially for kids,This wasn't my first time going to Disneyland. I have gone to HK Disneyland 2011 so I had some idea what to expect. This was almost exactly like HK-D and more. THis was definitely in a bigger scale and more spectacular. It is worth going for people with kids and even for adults. Already planning my next Japan trip with sister and her kids.
2054,2,15-Nov,Australia,"Dangerously overcrowded, have to gamble for right to attend shows, and forget about obtaining food","I have always liked Disney, and parts of this park are truly very nice. But with the number of people they let in, they are unable to provide the experience people pay dearly for. For an international attraction of an English-spoken origin, one should also expect their staff to speak better English.When we arrived, we planned to see a show. A staff pointed vaguely to a building saying we have to ""get lottery ticket"". I thought surely this got lost in translation. But no - inside the overcrowded hall were countless machines which looked like gamble machines in a casino. And yes: in this theme park for children, we had to gamble for the right to watch a show. The result was me having to explained to a crying disillusioned 3-year-old that we were NOT going to watch the show we promised her, because we did not ""win"". At this I lost my cool, and asked a staff member why we pay a fortune for tickets, and yet do not have the right to watch a show. She went off, and came back with a plaque pointing to various terms & conditions. Unbelievable.We were able to go onto a few rides, but the waits were endless. Everything is in Japanese, even the warnings. If you want food, you better bring it, unless you want to join an 80 metre queue for some popcorn. I consider it a neglect of duty of care, where people can't even obtain food or drink when they need it.The parade at night is nice, but crowded. What was worse was the walk back once the parade finished. All the lights were off initially, yet the crowds were huge, and it was pitch black. We were pushed around in all directions, and I had to carry my child out of fear she would be trampled. I shudder to think what would happen if ever a panic breaks out there.The attractions are nice (if you can get to them), and so is the atmosphere. But I honestly cannot recommend this park, let alone at the price they charge. I also do not consider this park safe for small children, as our daughter got knocked to the ground twice in overcrowded areas by people eager to get to something. I do not think this park represents the spirit of what Disney is meant to be about."
2055,4,15-Nov,Australia,Good number of attractions,"Good number of attractions here. Good for family outing but a bit pricey. We took the evening pass (after 6 pm) at a discount. Was quite crowded but thankfully it was the day after a long weekend, so the locals told us the crowd is already a lot less than usual.Was still packed with many young parents with kids and youths"
2056,5,15-Apr,Philippines,The happiest place on earth,We went here in the morning and there were no lines yet. Better to bring your stroller for kids 5 years old and below. I would suggest bringing your own water as the drinks are quite pricey. Book online to get a discount.
2057,4,15-Feb,Singapore,Fun for family and friends alike!,A fun place for both children and adults alike!  The rides are kids friendly and the whole place is filled with happy music with the live bands as well as parades!  Biggest drumstick I have ever eaten!  :))
2058,4,15-Aug,United Kingdom,A good day out,"Disneyland is always a great day out, I just wish it wasn't so expensive!Of course it is always the travellers choice whether or not to spend lots of money, so you don't have to spend loads if you don't want too.Disney is always a special place though, and Tokyo Disney is no different.  My family and I spent 3 days here (and Disney Sea) at the end of a 2 week Japan holiday, and we thoroughly enjoyed it."
2059,5,15-Nov,Taiwan,"Love love love Disney! Happy atmosphere, easy with FP, and so baby friendly!","I love Disneyland so much! It is definitely the place to be especially if you are with baby or young kids and juggling between ""land"" and ""sea"". Land definitely has more to do with babies and kids and is more baby friendly. ""DisneySea"" premises is larger and has many stairs and is more challenging to move around with baby car. Disneyland have so many parades especially on Christmas time it is a joy to be in! The parent alternate ride system(not available at ""sea"") and FP allowed us to enjoy almost all rides during our 2 day trip. We want to come back every year."
2060,5,15-Nov,United States,Affordable and Exciting :),Before this trip to Tokyo Disneyland I have not visited Disney since I was 5. I am so glad I made this trip and loved every minute of it :)
2061,5,15-Oct,United Kingdom,Smaller Disney,"Having visited, Euro Disney, Disney Land CA, and Disney World. This is definitely a smaller comparison,  We went midweek and park seemed to have alot of School visits, which made to the atmosphere, I have never been to such a clean and orderly park, but your in Japan what more do you expect, It was a the more expensive side, All rides were open, prob longest queue time was around 15 mins for tower of terror, "
2062,4,15-Nov,Japan,Great place but rude staff,"I love Disneyland but I had a bad experience with a rude cast member during my last visit. While waiting for the electrical parade, one of the cast members, Maehara kept on ordering us in a rude manner, even though I shifted to speaking to him in Japanese. When I told him that my father cannot sit on the ground because of his bad knees, he just dismissively waved his hands and told him to go to the back of the crowd. When my mother asked if she could just accompany my dad and I in buying a snack while waiting for the parade, he flatly told her no, with no explanation. There is no excuse for rudeness, especially in a business like Disneyland. Come on, train your cast members better!"
2063,5,15-May,United States,The Magic Kingdom,"The one that started it all in Japan - while it is familiar to anyone who has spent time at either Disneyland or WDW it is still different.  There are some interesting variations in Tomorrowland as well as other areas of the park such as the World Bazaar (their version of Main St USA).   That was the most fun, seeking out those different experiences that we can't get back at the US parks. It certainly lives up to the Disney reputation in every way.  However if you only have one day at the resort go to DisneySea, that should not be missed at all!  "
2064,4,14-Dec,N/A,Get a guide,"We had a great experience because we hired a guide for half a day. It is not even  half the price of a guide in the usa. You can book in advance, but the day we went it was raining so we were able to hire one at customer service early. This service let's you skip most lines. "
2065,5,15-Aug,Philippines,Childhood revisited,"Disneyland Tokyo, what more can i say it's just fantastic, don't go during August cause it's too hot, can't do much about the crowd since it's there to stay, kids and kids at heart will enjoy!"
2066,5,14-Dec,India,all round family entertainment!,It was a great experience for the whole family! The kids of course had so many options but even the adults became kids again!
2067,4,15-Nov,Australia,Excellent Disney Standards. ,"We visited with a ten and a six year old mid week. The best day to go to avoid crowds is a Wednesday. Make sure you pick up fast passes for the rides you really want. This system is excellent and prevents the need to queue for hours. Make sure you go for lunch early if going to a sit down restaurant as you may need to queue as well. He children really enjoyed two of the three parades that we could have watched. We saw the Christmas parade, complete with fake snow and the night parade which is spectacular. The staff are extremely friendly and polite. They guide with warmth and kindness and if they are imposing rules they do so in a tactful and pleasant way ( no running, baby strollers to be folded and no one to stand at the front during parade viewing) The Disney themed rides are beautifully done and some had a special Christmas theme. Thunder mountain was shut. We waited the ingest period to meet Mickey and for lunch. Everything else we either fast passed or had a relatively brief wait. Top tips. Do not go on the weekend. Use fast passes. Eat early. The children had a totally awesome time. And so did I. "
2068,4,15-Nov,Japan,expensive but should go once,"It is the best Disneypark outside of the US. It is expensive for a family to go to, two adults and two kids will set you back 200 to 250 USD to get in and minimum another 100 USD for spending, but better make that 200, so for a day out, you are 500 usd out of pocket, that is not staying at one of the Disney hotels, which will cost between 120 to 250 usd. I suggest you pick a weekday, Monday and Tuesday are the best, of course kids go to school then, but it the only comfortable days really to enjoy the rides and attractions. Otherwise be prepared to spend 60 to 70 % of your day waiting in lines."
2069,4,15-Oct,United States,"Great rides, fun for the family","We went there for 2 days and we had a blast with the family. Be prepared for the crowds, it can get pretty bad so leave yourself plenty of time to be able to enjoy the rides that aren't offered in the US. The Japanese are a wonderful people and they really know how to bring out the Disney Magic."
2070,5,15-May,Australia,I felt like a kid again,"My favourite experience in Japan and if given the chance I would go again in a heart beat. Although it was really busy, I didn't have to wait long to get on the rides, but I would recommend getting the fast pass to come back to the ride later. The people working at Disneyland were extremely helpful and there was so much to see and do. I would definitely recommend staying until closing for the light and fireworks show."
2071,5,15-Nov,Malaysia,Dreamland for kids ... and their parents,"Disneyland is easy to reach from Tokyo station, only one line. We reached the gate very early, since we took early train to avoid rush hour. By close to 7 AM, there was already people lining up at the gate, such enthusiasm. Once the gate opened, those kids were literally running into the park to attack their wanted rides. For us with young kids, we could only watch, settled with less-queue rides, enjoy the parade. For info the day we went (in November) was the 1st day they're doing Xmas themed parades, so it's already on. "
2072,3,15-Oct,Australia,"Very, very busy","This is the fourth Disneyland I've visited (Anaheim, Hong Kong and Paris being the others), and although the quality of rides, cleanliness and value is amongst the best - the crowds made it almost unbearable.  I visited mid-week, on what was supposed to be a quiet day, but by mid-morning a lot of the fast-pass tickets had already been allocated for the day, and the wait times for the more popular attractions were 1.5 hours long. I'd recommend visiting if you have never been to a Disney park before, but be prepared for long lines."
2073,5,15-Jul,Malaysia,Immerse Yourself In A Wonderful World,"If you're looking for places to spend for a long full day, this is it. Although almost all of shows are in Japanese language, they are still very enjoyable.Do check out the events and shows timetable, there are seasonal events and shows, as well as nightlight parade, on specified dates."
2074,5,14-Dec,N/A,I feel young again,"My best experience in Japan. This was my first Disneyland experience. I love theme parks! Although I came here alone because my travel mate doesn't like theme park, but I didn't feel lonely there. It's so happening. I visited there from the opening time till closing time. Since I went there during weekend, the park was very crowded with families. We need to queue for 1-2 hours per game, but it didn't matter for me. There were parades of Disney characters and happy musics every where. I will go to Hong Kong next year and I hope that Hong Kong Disneyland would be as good or even better than Tokyo Disneyland!"
2075,5,15-Oct,Australia,"Busy,busy,busy!","Tokyo Disney felt very similar to Disneyland in LA. The only differences are that Main Street in Tokyo is covered in, which does give it a different feel and merchandise was quite  limited compared to LA. The rides were all great and the park was very clean. I think food was probably a bit cheaper than LA. The parks were very very busy! We went during the week but still packed! All good tho as we found the Japanese people to be lovely, helpful and considerate. "
2076,3,14-Dec,N/A,Fun activity ,"The only way to go to Disneyland Tokyo is to be there prior to its opening (8:30am generally but varies so check the website) and in the line! Take a train and you will be able to follow the crowds to the entry. You are able to pre purchase tickets (which is recommended) from any Disney store. I purchased mine for the Disney store in Shinjuku the day before. Ride lines get excessively big after 11, so jump on as many as you can in the morning! If you are after thrill rides this is not the attraction park for you, rides are generally bag friendly and young child friendly. Only one roller coaster was open when I went and it wasn't the greatest. The coolest ride (I think)that is in offer is the Monsters Inc. ride which you can purchase a photo from. The parades are cute to watch but crowds build quickly, with people sitting on matts awaiting the start time (which can be done an hour in advance). There are an excessive amount of souvenirs on offer and are fairly priced. The best snack to purchase is one of the many varieties of flavoured popcorn on offer! Rating: 3/5"
2077,3,15-Nov,Singapore,Something a little different,"Most popular rides were Monsters Inc and Winnie the Pooh's Hunny Hunn - grab the fast passes early as they run out extremely quickly. We split our party such that while one was Qing for the first ride (e.g. Buzz), the other ran to grab the fast pass for the most popular ride (e.g. Monsters). You can take fast passes for other rides 2 hours after your current fast pass expires.Be prepared to wait at least an hour for most rides, for all dining options (pop corn carts included). Parades are popular, and the best spots are taken up about an hour before the show starts. People are serious about laying out their mats and enjoying some down time just to wait 60 mins till parade time.There is no restriction in the carry of food and drinks into the park, so home carry picnic is highly recommended!Try the lottery for some of the shows - we were at the park for 2 days, and failed at all attempts to get those much coveted seats"
2078,3,15-Feb,United Kingdom,"Fun, but hopelessly overcrowded","TDL is great. It's full of fun, games and enjoyable rides, and well worth a trip. BUT, and it's a big but, the place is overcrowded on weekends to the point of farce. Even weekdays can be hard going. 3 hour waits for rides is an insult to paying customers, but Disney are of course happy to take advantage. They squeeze as many as possible through the gates each day, and couldn't care less about maximizing their enjoyment, so long as they keep on lining up.  That's to be expected of any major corporation though, so if you do go you just have to make it work as best you can:1) NEVER go on weekends/national holidays2) Get there half an hour BEFORE gates open3) Grab FastPasses as soon as they're available4) Eat outside of the main meal times5) Make a top 3 of must ride/ must do things and do them. Anything else is a bonusMaybe some of the above is obvious to seasoned Disney goers, but I'd never been to any Disney park before TDL. These are things I wish I'd known for my first visit, and have stood me in good stead ever since. :)"
2079,3,15-Nov,Finland,"More suited for kids, but still impressive for adults","Big Thunder Mountain was closed on the day we visited, thus only the Space Mountain could be considered something a thrill-seeking visitor might enjoy. However, even many of the ""kids' rides"" are quite impressive and the fireworks + video/light show projected on the castle walls in the evening are worth seeing.The lines were not as bad as we expected, as we only had a longer wait to Splash Mountain (about 90 minutes). We got in to most attractions in 20-30 minutes. I'm reducing one point due to the Fastpass queue skipping thing, because it really annoyed of us (and many other in the long line of Splash Mountain, as well).Unsurprisingly, a day trip to the Disneyland costs almost a small fortune, but this is to be expected. Extra points for the superior staff, who were smiling the whole day, even though working long days at an attraction park is not always the easiest. They seemed very professional to us."
2080,2,15-Nov,New Zealand,Just too busy,Apparently the second busiest park in the world and it feels it. Even on a Monday during a working week it was hectic. In other respects it is fantastic but the hordes and the lines ruined it for me. Our kids from 2yrs to 14yrs thought it was pretty good but the older ones preferred Universal because of the rides. The littler ones loved the parades and the princesses. Once is worthwhile but we won't be back. 
2081,5,15-Oct,United Kingdom,My first Disney park,"Well when in Tokyo you should really do Disney. We went on the nighttime pass which is available after 6pm, don't be deceived that it will be quieter as it's definitely not. There are no fast passes available but the longest we Q'd for a ride was probably only 20 mins. There are a few single rider q jumps as well which are definatly work taking. Indiana Jones is one of these and it's a great ride. The parade was magical and you must watch the show on the castle. A must do"
2082,4,15-Oct,Indonesia,Get ready for the crowds,"I had read many reviews about the incredible crowds, but even choosing ""quiet"" days did not seem to matter. Comparing to HK Disneyland, this property is much closer to the real thing compared to Anaheim Disneyland but is probably about 20% smaller than that location. Unlike Hong Kong, it does have the Pirates of the Caribbean (never waited more than five minutes to get on this ride), the Haunted House and a number of other favourites from the USA. Following are some observations:This park is very much for the Japanese. Understandably, it is in Japan and probably less than five percent are expatriates. If this is your first visit with young ones, consider that all of the communications in the rides are in Japanese.Popcorn is an incredible experience at this park. People will stand 50 deep waiting for up to an hour to buy popcorn. Hey, I love the stuff, but I will not stand in that kind of line waiting for popcorn. And be careful...it is only sold at the stands. When buying popcorn at the concession stand, you still have to go stand in line at the popcorn booth...go figure!Be prepared for Japanese who completely deck themselves out in Disney costumes. Yes, grown up couples in their 20's, 30's, 40's and even 50's decked out like Mickey and Minnie Mouse! As well as lot's of young women dressed to the nines in princess costumes. I even had a grown gentleman singing the Critter Country song and showing me all his passes to Anaheim and Epcot throughout the ride.If you are on a mission to get your little one to meet a character or a princess, good luck - better to go to HK. Characters are rarely available in the park except for parades at a distance and at the entrance. That's it and good luck.The food is a little better than HK, but not by much. Take the monorail to Iksipari Mall where there are plenty of choices for good food.Fast-pass is available, but you may only secure one fast-pass at a time and until you ride the ride, you will not be able to obtain another Fast-pass. Also, don't be surprised if all fast-passes are taken up by midday. As mentioned, the crowds are overwhelming and get worse by the day. Go for Monday/Tuesday, but even still, it is daunting.Was it worth the trip? I guess so as we visited various locations in Tokyo. Would I do it again with three kids aged 12, 11 and 5? Nope. Even though it is smaller, HK is much easier to navigate and easier to get on rides.We spent two days at Disneyland and one day at Disney Sea. The latter is just as daunting and one day is not enough - you would need at least two days. However, food options are better in this park.Good luck!"
2083,5,15-Oct,Malaysia,Fun to relax.,Getting to the fun land and great choices rides ready for everyone whether young or old as long enjoy the decoration and prices food is very steep. Only let down is no fireworks claim weather unpermitable but guess is not right as the day during the visit is very great from morning till dusk. Hmm maybe a gimmick.
2084,5,15-May,Canada,Familiar yet unique,"We loved the special attention to details here, and the landscaping and flowers were really beautiful. The park really shone like a shiny penny when we were there. Less shopping available than US stores.  Don't miss Pooh's ride: so fun and so well done."
2085,4,15-Nov,Australia,The same Disney fun,"The best thing about this place is the staff, they are so friendly and helpful and they always smile and wave at you every time you board a ride (a smile transcends the language barrier). I went to Disneyland LA earlier in the year and I found the Tokyo version to be very similar. Note Tokyo Disneyland does not accept the Commonwealth Bank Travel Money Card (to pay for admission anyway) so have some other payment method organised if this is what you rely on. Due to the rain, the 10.40am Christmas parade and the 7:30pm Electrical Parade were cancelled, but both were substituted. Also, at least one 'Minnie Oh Minnie' show was cancelled because it is outdoors (Disney could probably afford to get a cover over the area though). Possibly other events were cancelled too on account of the weather, but these are the ones I know of. To have seats for the 'One Man's Dream' show at the Showbase (which is outdoors but fully under cover) and the 'Once Upon A Time' (outdoors) you have to go to the Tomorrowland Hall Building and scan your admission ticket where you go into a lottery to see if you get a seat. You only get one shot at this. For 'Once Upon A Time' it doesn't really matter because you can just stand to look at the Cinderella Castle. For 'One Man's Dream' I guess it means you miss out. It's a bit of a funny system because people who want to go might miss out and people who are successful in the lottery might change their mind and end up not going. When I watched it at 6.10pm there were 10 empty seats right in the middle of the audience.To get there, I used my pre-paid PASMO card to take the Keiyo line from Tokyo station to Mahaima station. One benefit of the rain was that there were fewer people so lines were shorter. Between 9:30am and 9:30pm I managed to fit in 2 shows and 15 rides using four Fast Passes."
2086,5,15-Nov,United Kingdom,OMG SO FUN FOR EVERYONE,Enjoyed the whole Park but the star wars simulation was my favourite!!! The amazing thing is the ques felt like part of the rides. So much to look at wich makes it feel like your not even waiting to get on the rides
2087,4,15-Nov,Singapore,Tokyo Disneyland Friendly Staff,"I  love the staffs in Tokyo Disneyland. They were polite and every single one of them greeted us with a genuine smile! Although most of them do not speak English, I say it isn't really a problem because they try their best to communicate through other ways. Only downside was the length of waiting time to each attraction take at least 45 minutes to an hour and even more! But then again it's Disneyland so queuing and waiting is part of the game."
2088,5,15-Nov,United States,Great time enjoying the Park,"Went on Tuesday and it was raining off and on so the crowd was less than I expected. Lines were short and did everything I wanted to. Parade was rained out but they had a short motorized version. Only complaint is I missed the live Once upon Time stage show due to a lottery system for a ticket. I didn't win and when I tried for a open seat before the show began, there are none without a ticket! Empty seats going to waste was frustrating!"
2089,5,15-Nov,N/A,Mickey Mouse & Friends!,"Definitely a must visit if you have never been to a Disney land theme park before as this was my first, I started to feel like I was reliving all my childhood again once I saw Mickey Mouse! There aren't many rides for adults as such (the teaspoon ride was probably one of the most fun for adults as you get to spin in the tea cup as fast as you can turn the handle üòÅ)If you're bringing a family the kids will definitely love it, many things to do but be warned waiting in line for some of the rides could take up to at least 30mins+ as there are these types of signs around warning you the minimum wait time. Stick around long enough until night time and you'll get to see a night show that they do and wow it is amazing to see! Many gifts to purchase also!"
2090,4,15-Jul,United Kingdom,Worth visit but they don't speak English at all,"I love Disney, always been a fan of Disney, and I find Tokyo disneyland very beautiful, but the only problem was they don't speak English, I speak Japanese so it is not a problem, but it was a problem for my foreign friends."
2091,4,15-Nov,United States,Definitely worth the visit,"This is a great family park. It's currently Christmas themed through November to December 25th. It's very busy - the only ride we went on was space mountain and the queue was over an hour long. Big thunder mountain was closed. It costs ¬•6900 yen to get in.Unlike other Disneylands, don't expect people to speak English well. We spoke good Japanese so we were fine, but I can imagine this being a problem with others. Park is very easy to get to, you just get off at the Maihama station and it's right there. All in all we had a lot of fun and it was a good day outing"
2092,5,15-Nov,South Africa,It's Disney Land!! :),"I was warned of long waiting queues, but I went on a Wednesday and got there half an hour before they opened, and I did 3 or 4 rides within the first hour and a half!This place is epic. I've been here twice and I can't imagine going to Tokyo and not spending a full day here (Which on a week day was more than enough time for me)Try the different popcorns! And the Star Wars ride and Splash mountain was my fave.Before going, google search the Tokyo Disney Crown calendars, and check on the official website for the closed rides!!"
2093,2,15-Nov,Australia,Long queue to do anything,I may just be becoming an old fart but two hours in a cue for A 5 minute (if that) ride is not my idea of fun. We were there on a Wednesday and the place was packed with school groups and families with children. There was a queue for everything from the toilets to the food to the attractions and to be honest it was just not worth it. We arrived mid morning and the fast track passes had finished and watching people head to the top of the queue was super annoying . They should guarantee at least one fast pass Per person. 
2094,5,14-Dec,United States,Fabulous Disney experience!,"I have been to all of the Disney Parks (minus Hong Kong) and I must say that this park is wonderful to experience. It is very, very similar to the original Disneyland in Anaheim, CA. The park is pristine and the cast members are incredibly friendly and helpful. All of the rides were in working order. We had a great time. Visit Tokyo Disneyland if you are a Disney lover and you have the opportunity. You won't regret it."
2095,4,15-Nov,United Kingdom,Great day out for people of all ages,"Our last day in Japan, we visited Disneyland. We had a wonderful time. The park was clearly well maintained, the staff were energetic and full of enthusiasm.The only real criticism with the park that we had was that the park didn't serve any alcohol. A tip well worth knowing is that splash mountain has a single riders queue (go down the fast track line and say you're a single rider). You'll end up queuing for around 10 minutes, instead of over an hour"
2096,4,15-Nov,Australia,Best Disney IMHO ,"This time last year we were in Disney LA and i have to say Tokyo wins hands down. The staff are vibrant and friendly and go out of their way to be understood. We checked and were told Thursday was a good day and most rides were less than an hour, some only 15 minutes. There was also use of the fastpass on many rides.We ate lots of different food, went on some rides, watched some shows and went shopping. A great day with easy access by train from Tokyo station."
2097,4,15-Oct,Philippines,The Disney Experience,"A Disney park is a Disney park.  While it may seem like a generic park compared to it's DisneySea neighbor, it still becoming on it's own.  It's classic Disney with the castle and parades.  It was raining when we went to visit, but it did not seem to deter locals.  I have not seen a crowd so involved in a theme park as the Japanese are.  It's completely fascinating and makes the experience so much more than your other Disney visits.  While kids normally dress up to go to Disney, age is not a requirement here.  Everyone, in every age, seems to prepare for their visit.  They wear their garb with pride as couples or groups.  In fact, you may feel a bit out of place not even wearing a Mickey Mouse headband here.  Trust me, I did.  I bought Minnie Mouse hair clips so I can get with the program.  While the crowd is invigorating, it can also cause you claustrophobia.  As a tourist, avoid visiting during the weekend.  The residents are fans of the park.  They know how a Fastpass works.  Fastpasses typically run out by noon.  So figure out which one you'd like to Fastpass before getting to the park.  The lines can be unbelievably long.  So, prepare to wait.  And be patient.  None of the locals complain about the line.  They all know what they signed up for, you should too.  The rides are classic Disney, but I suggest taking the attractions that are unique here. My personal favorites were Star Tours, Haunted Mansion (which was Nightmare Before Christmas-themed during our visit), Pirates of the Caribbean, Splash Mountain, Space Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain, and the Jungle Cruise.  I did not understand a word out of the Japanese tourist guide, but she sure was animated.  And Cinderella's Fairy Tale Hall was pretty cute.  Good for wannabe-princesses of any age. :)Expect to have fun in this place, even with just watching the crowd.  The vibe itself makes it more unique than any other Disneyland park."
2098,5,15-Nov,Singapore,A fascinating park,A place for family with kids to visitShould be on the number 1 listThe atmosphere there with the locals visiting the park add on more fun to our visits although the q time were all long
2099,5,15-Oct,Thailand,Disneyland - perfection!,"Its a must for any Disneyland fan.Very very very very busy - very long lines for all rides, but its Disney, and hey you suck it up and enjoy!!!"
2100,4,15-Jun,United States,Good Park NOT Crowd,"Tokyo Disneyland Park is two adjacent parks, much like the ones in California.  Tokyo Disneyland is much like the classic parks most are familiar with.  We only spent a day in each park so we didn't experience every attraction. Many of the attractions are the same as the parks in the US, Haunted Mansion is very much like the one in California, except I'm fairly sure they don't add the Nightmare Before Christmas figures. There is a beautiful big Alice in Wonderland themed restaurant called Queen of Hearts. Jungle Cruise is definitely advanced over the ones in the USA, there are some new figures, underwater explosions, fire and a part with a Mayan cave w projections of crawling bugs similar to Indiana Jones. Pooh‚Äôs Hunny Hunt was one of the true treasures, I don't really like the one in California but this one is very advanced. This attraction uses magnetic cars so there is no track, early in the ride your car does a kind of square dance with the other cars.  there are lots of animated figures, and at one point you are in a room with a very wide screen and the scenery is projected to give you the sensation of moving up and down. We also rode Monsters inc, Pirates (we walked right on), Mickey Philharmagic, Star tours; all these were much like there US counterparts and all had little or no waits. A big attraction of this park are the stands selling various flavors of popcorn, each stand has it's own unique flavor, like near the Winnie pooh ride they sell honey flavored popcorn. The parade was called Happiness is Here and the nighttime spectacular was Once Upon A Time: a show of projections on the castle and synchronized fireworks.The park was not crowded at all, most attractions we could just walk on with a 5 minute or less wait. "
2101,5,15-Jun,Malaysia,We Had A Great Time Here!,"If the hotel you are staying at is far from Tokyo Disneyland, I would advise that you take a later train to avoid the morning rush hour. But try not to get there too late to avoid the long queues especially at the more popular rides.Overall, we enjoyed almost all of the attractions there and stayed until closing time. The parade is something that is not to be missed. What we find intriguing here compared to other theme parks outside Japan is that the official souvenirs are really reasonably priced. And if you did not have time to buy souvenirs before closing time, don't worry as there is a Disney souvenir shop just outside the Disneyland that opens till quite late."
2102,5,14-Dec,Philippines,First Christmas in Japan,"I visited Disneyland last 23 Dec 1990I think it was the birthday of Prince Hirohito a holiday, so I took the opportunity to see Disneyland.Its quite cold but, excitement will drive you adrenaline to top level, my first Disneyland visit , so everything were pure excitement , from opening of the gates until I complete the whole adventureland.......an experience which I will not forget...hopefully we can come back there , my whole family palnned to go to Japan this Feb 2016."
2103,5,14-Nov,India,Awesome place to visit in Tokyo,Disneyland is great place to enjoy in Tokyo. You can take the ticket to Disneyland or Disneysea. Both can't be covered in a same day. Don't miss the evening parade.
2104,4,15-Oct,Argentina,Expectable...,"It was a nice day but we expected more things on star wars or a less crowded park. Ques were between 90 to 120 minFast passes were out at 11.30In the overall, it was nice visiting, japanese are very polite and clean but much to crowded!! There should be more fast passes to organize better or a max limit for entrances/ people at the park. At times it was even impossible to walk!!!"
2105,5,15-Jun,Malaysia,Having Fun!,"Of course we are having fun.....Tokyo Disneyland is cleaner than the Hong Kong Disneyland, very peaceful here and no one will jump your queue. Staff are so friendly and there are a lot of staff standing by by the entrance make sure the traffic is under control. Compare to our last visit, we found that this time the choices of gift is keep repeating....."
2106,4,15-Oct,N/A,Magical experience for first timers,"It was the first time we brought our two year old to Disneyland, we started early in the morning around 10am and stayed till closing time 10pm watching the parades and enjoying most of the rides.  We spent most of our time in Fantasy Land and Toon Town where the rides are more suited for toddlers.We had lunch at Queen of Hearts restaurant and the was surprisingly much better than we expected (compared to other theme parks like Universal Studios).  We went shopping in Disney stores for an hour while our kid was taking a nap.Strongly recommend staying till closing time because the highlight was the night parade, it was amazing with the fireworks display.  Although there were still many visitors during mid week, we did not wait too long for some of the  rides using the Fast Pass."
2107,5,15-Sep,United Kingdom,Where all your dreams come true!,"It's absolutely true - Tokyo Disneyland is a truly magical place. My husband and I (no kids) had a wonderful time and absolutely loved the attention to detail. We were fortunate enough to see both a rainy day parade in place of the proper parade and whilst the rainy day one was simply the characters on floats it was still great to watch and we loved our time in this park.Plenty to do, plenty to see. Characters were out and about and the decorations for Halloween were simply stunning.The evening parade was fantastic - well worth getting a spot early as everyone is sitting down but we managed to squeeze in and thoroughly enjoyed it.The shops were terrific with lots of goodies and all very tempting.Cast members were very helpful and would do anything to try and help you.Really enjoyed pin trading in this park and was delighted with some great finds.Queue times were never too long so we did manage to get round everything in a couple of days. Great atmosphere. As you can no doubt tell, we absolutely loved this park."
2108,2,15-Oct,United Kingdom,As you would expect but far too crowded,"We did two days at Disney Resort and Disney Sea, mid week.  The crowds were awful and the queues for the rides ranged from 15 to 140 mins long.  Visiting with a child with Social disabilities was very challenging.  We managed to get a few fast passes but as we were there at 10am the fast passes were for 8pm onwards.  So prepare for a long day"
2109,4,15-Oct,United Kingdom,Tokyo Disney Resorts,"This was a wonderful experience which is not just for the children. Disney Sea has a much more adult themed number of displays and events but both were magnificent. The commentaries and shows are in Japanese but this does not detract from the magnificence of their presentations. On the days we went some of the shows were cancelled and alternatives put on but what we saw was truly amazing so I can only imagine the magnificence of a full blown show.  To sum up an excellent couple of days, because it takes at least a day to get around each park, especially if you intend to try the rides, although fast track tickets are available at certain times.  The  culmination of the day is a glorious light and fireworks  which is visible from both parks."
2110,4,15-Oct,Singapore,Enjoyable at night,"Bought 3-day passes in advance for family of 5. Went disneysea on the first day, and Disneyland for the next 2. Initially unfamiliar with the fastpass system. Spent most of the time walking around. The crowd was much thinner at night. Kids were able to take many rides without much queuing, and they enjoyed very much. Definitely the happiest place on earth!"

2112,4,14-Nov,United States,Very nice experience,This was our first visit to disney. Being the first disney theme park in Asia the place has been kept well. We went on a weekday to avoid the crowd but still faced queues in most of the attractions.Overall a very good place to spend the day. We did not take the aqua pass.
2113,5,15-Sep,Malaysia,Feeling like a child again!,"Tokyo Disneyland is truly impressive - even from the time you step in through the turnstiles. Crew members greet you with big smiles and welcome you to the magical world of Disney. Throughout my time in Tokyo Disneyland, I couldn't fault it one bit. The whole environment is amazing, super clean and well organised. The rides are very well maintained and the characters that come out to meet you are spectacular - each one truly imbibes the characteristics of the characters themselves and you can't help but fall in love with Disney all over again!The parades are very popular with the regulars at Disneyland and Sea so make sure you get there at least 30-45 minutes before if you want to get good seating spots (earlier if you want the best!). Make sure that at least one member of your party keeps your spot while maybe the rest can go and scout for food etc. It's best if you're able to familiarise yourself with the map and also plan Fast Passes if you're wanting to get in as much as possible. We went on a weekday and it was thoroughly packed out. There was barely space to walk so make sure you are efficient with time!Disney characters as I mentioned earlier are very friendly - the less famous ones (Mickey, Minnie, Donald and Daisy tend to have long queues) are easier to take pictures with. All you need to do is to get their attention but be polite!Overall, enjoy all that Disney has to offer and make sure you don't miss out on the awesome snacks. There are loads of great Tokyo Disney Resort websites you can refer to if you need tips. P/S If it's your birthday - make sure you get a birthday sticker and you'll be treated to loads of birthday greetings, big smiles and applause. You'll feel like part of the family too."
2114,5,15-Feb,France,it's the happiest day of my life,"overall, it's an amazing experience and blew my mind away, the attractions and setting led us into the magical world, and the attractions were all so unique in their own specific way, the food were all tasty, very very good food for amusement park, absolutely love it, and would want to come many more times to rides that i've missed this time!"
2115,5,15-Mar,N/A,Spring Break Experience,"Although it was cold on this day, I had an extraordinary day at the park. I remember making it to the park right after 6:00 PM, when the ticket was cheaper. Also, the park closed at 10:00 PM which was unfavorable, but I had fun. The parade was fantastic and also the last performance. I wouldn't have missed going to Tokyo Disneyland, if I could. I'm American, so I didn't want to miss my opportunity."
2116,3,15-Oct,China,It's OK but not SEA,"TKDL is still a good sized one.With less cool attractions and less cool merchandise than SEA, if you only have 1 day pick SEA.If you can spare a day more then might as well do TKDL as well.Remember to make use of fast passes. The fast pass will say whe. You can pick up your next fast pass if this one is for later.Snacks is the real differentiation at stalls from SEA.I wasn't sure why girls dress identically in pairs but it could be a cultural thing."
2117,4,15-Oct,Singapore,Excellent attraction,"There's something for everyone - be it young or old! So, do not worry too much if you think you might get bored. It's especially good for younger aged childrens (ie: toddlers) ranging anything from 2 to 6 years."
2118,5,15-Oct,Sweden,Offers great attraction for family and solos,"Tokyo Disney Resort is just amazing with great attractions such as Space Mountain, Space Tours and Winnie the Poh. Do not miss the show around 8 pm where there is a massive projection on the castle. This is mandatory (but be in time and use the fast passes-system)."
2119,5,15-Sep,United Kingdom,Must visit!!,"We visited Disneyland Tokyo during Holloween season. We loved all the seasonal treats and snacks. It's a great and fun way to try some Japanese food. The park is beautiful, very pretty and well kept. We intended to spend half a day here as we have done Disney in a few countries. However we spent a day here as we were having such a great time. Definitely worth visiting.We purchased a 2 day park entry which was for Disneyland Tokyo. For visiting two parks in two days it cost about ¬£40. Under ¬£20 is fantastic value  for Disney.The staff were all fantastic. It's well worth getting fast passes to avoid queue."
2120,4,15-Oct,United Kingdom,"Even quiet is very busy, but great experience !","Tokyo Disneyland was a new experience for our family. We had visited this amusement park in France and the USA, but this was different. Mainly because of the Japanese people. They are incredibly well organized, respectful, friendly and patient. We chose a ""quite"" day to go to Tokyo Disneyland. Online you can find a ""barometer"" which tells you the good and the ""bad"" days to go. Our day was relatively quiet according the ""barometer"", but around 3 pm, the waiting time for attractions hit the 60+ minutes. It is great to see how Japanese people, young and old arrive dressed up in their Disney outfit and enjoy their day. I got the feeling though that the fast attractions like Thunder Mountain and Space Mountain, were not as fast or exciting as in the other parks."
2121,5,15-Oct,Japan,Different but still Disney,"We are huge WDW fans. After moving to Japan, we were eager to check out TDL and it was great.  We went on a Friday and there was a light rain, so it wasn't super crowded but it was far from empty.  We made good use of the FP program and rode an impressive number of rides.  It was exhausting but tons of fun.The biggest issue for us was finding western food.  Additionally, the lines for food were insane!!  Plan to eat at off times and that will help with the lines.  If you have picky eaters (like I do), you might be in trouble.  I packed a backpack with snacks, which was a lifesaver. We are already planning a return trip."
2122,5,14-Dec,Malaysia,"Compact, complete and clean","This park is a complete and compact version of Anaheim. It has most of the attractions you will find in LA. Fast passes were not many issued per day. So in order to get as many is to come as soon as it opens at 8am to get some luck at them all. Some rides with fast passes only available at 5pm onward. Otherwise the usual way is to queue to get in. On heavy traffic expect to wait max 200mins for a popular ride. If  you buy dual park tickets DisneySea is just next door, so one could just go in and out between Disneyland and DisneySea. The unusual popcorn I came across here was the Curry flavoured popcorn which was worth the try. There are many themed eateries in the park and 1 Japanese restaurant at the Main Street.  Street parades day and night should not be missed too"
2123,4,15-Oct,Singapore,Good family fun place,"We were at Tokyo Disneyland yesterday ( at disneysea 2 days prior) .  Is difficult to compare the 2 parks , however our overall preference is disneyland .  The park seems bigger and has more space to walk around . It gives a more magical feeling; the electric parade was awesome. The last time I was there was 30 years ago and it has not lost its magical touch ."
2124,3,15-Jul,South Africa,Take children,"This is a must have children with,  stop. Went with a group of Scouts prior to going to the Jamboree. Venue is very clean and the staff friendly and helpful. Language could be a problem at times. the children certainly enjoyed themselves on the rides. Half way through the day someone explained the preferred ticketing system. this eliminates having to stand in que's all the time and there are certainly enough of those.Had to take a child to the medical facilities. Very helpful and fast.Lots to see and do, however it could work out pricey with exchange rates"
2125,4,15-Oct,Thailand,Dreamland for the Family,"Good place for any family trips. It is just only 15 minutes from Tokyo station. Enjoy the Disney theme park, and the wonderful show (depends on a time schedule in each day). The several shows have a limited time to access. Therefore, the whole visitor should have to take a fast pass (ticket for any show) immediately after entered to the park location."
2126,5,15-Oct,Thailand,""" Being a child again ""","     It's quite a bit hard to describe all of Disneyland by just a few photos and a couple of paragraphs. In my opinion Tokyo Disneyland suitable for all ages. No matter how old you are. Absolutely incredible when you step into Disneyland. You will feel like a child again.     One day is not enough at all, because there really is so much things to do and see  it's better if you get the 2 day pass or more.     Attractions: There are a lot of rides and entertainment shows for different age groups. Some people might say, it's extremely crowded and the queue were long for the popular rides at least 30 min. If you have FastPass is well worth it. Save so much time.     Parades/show/Disney Characters Greetings: were absolutely lovely,fantastic and enjoyable to see the magic of Disney.     Restaurant: can be long queue to waiting at peak time, so you can pre booking online as same the date you buy the ticket online.      Staff: Friendly,Politely and Helpful.***Pre-planning to save your times.- Check first in a crowd calendar available online the            day,atmosphere.- Good time to visit is come during weekdays. Avoided weekend and public holidays.- Booking online Disney 's eTicket and FastPass is very useful. Printing at home and go directly to the gate.- check a map. What kind of ride that you really want to do and see. ( you can't see everything in 1 day )- Staying in hotel which is located right in front of the park is also an advantage, so that you can come to the park or back to the hotel anytime as you want.- Lot of walking, wear comfortable shoes.- Stroller and wheelchair available for rental. In case for kids or older getting tried of walking.- If you plan to visit the park and after that you are planning to go to the airport directly. There is also have storage lockers of all sizes so that you can keep your belongings.- Leave the park early before closure time because the bus,the train station can be extremely crowd.^^ Don't expect too much , just enjoy your moments^^"
2127,5,14-Nov,Vietnam,Place to be with your family of kids (under 12 maybe),"Love the park, especially the parade. The writings on the tomb stones at the Haunted Mansion gave me a long good laugh. Kids loved this second best to Disneysea. They liked best Grand Circuit Race way which was great fun. All rides are exciting."
2128,5,15-Oct,Australia,Surprisingly fantastic day!!,Amazing day out for 2 middle aged oldies who thought they might not enjoy the kid stuff. Excellent rides....amazing float parades. Would thoroughly recommend it for anyone visiting Tokyo!!!
2129,4,15-Oct,Spain,"Disney magic, Japanese style","The resort is at very easy reach from Tokyo center. Attractions are very good, but expect some long lines, especially for the most popular ones (for adults). Make sure you use the Fast Pass tool to skip some of the lines, otherwise expect at least 30/45 minutes wait for each ride. We went on an ordinary tuesday of october, bought tickets online the night before and went straight in. Lines were ok, but we did not use any of the hit attractions, as we were with a 4 years old and a toddler. Cast members speak very little Japanese, so beware. Food is not excessively priced, but expect lines for that too, so you may be better off to bring some snacks from home."
2130,5,15-Sep,Australia,Awesome Place,"This is an awesome place, you need more then one day as there is so much to see and do. It was my other halfs birthday and we bought him the birthday ticket (advise to buy on line) and everyone at Disney said happy birthday to him and really made it an a birthday to remember...even if it was his 38 birthday, at Disneyland, your allowed to be a child for a day :) We had lunch at the Mad Hatter's Caf√© and the food was so good and the staff were really nice. Would love to go back."
2131,5,15-Mar,United States,Better than the original in L.A.,We've been several times to the Disneyland in L.A. and Disneyworld in Orlando.  This was our first visit to the Tokyo version.  Best for kids age of about 6 to 14.  We really liked the Disney Sea park themed uniquely so and only found in Tokyo.  Crowds are ridiculous during weekends and holidays.  Mid-week crowds were very tame.  Customer service is excellent.  Hotels are pretty expensive but the admission ticket is less than what you'd spend in the U.S.  Food is ok - priced ok.  Skip the 'pottage corn' flavored pop corn unless you like the taste of powdered creamed corn put onto popcorn.  The sausage rolls were excellent and my wife that typically doesn't like sausage loved it.    We'll definitely go back if we get a chance.
2132,3,14-Nov,N/A,So-so,"The rides here are very tame. We queued for hours at some rides. Other that that, the staff were all helpful, goods were very nice albeit ex, food tasted good. I love their themed seasons. I went during Halloween and their decorations were interesting and eye-catching.All in all, a fairly good experience. Disneyland is definitely best for families with children but if you're looking for better, thrilling rides, Disneysea is a better choice."
2133,5,15-Sep,Saudi Arabia,Disney.. Magical but Japanese,"A better experience than Disneyland Paris, that's for sure.As much as we waited in lines, we were able to enter all the attractions and see all the shows we planned to see. However, the rain caused for two parades and one show to cancel. Yet, the two parades we got to see were so long, so big and so spectacular kids got more than enough of it and went to sleep.Japanese tourists are so organized and polite they make the experience super fun for all."
2134,5,15-Oct,Thailand,Wowwww,"First of all, I would say I don't think this going to be fun. However, after I get in there I feel enjoy and fun. The park itself clean and well organized. I can see all caring and attention to all detail. To control 100000 of people is possible here. Of course you need to wait an hours to play each zone but it's worth. The time that you lost will return as the memorable. They invest of lots of capital and create function incredibly."
2135,5,15-Apr,Taiwan,The World of Happinness,"This is where dreams come true, where love is found, and happiness everywhere. When you go there, you can see many kinds of attractions, scary, exciting, fun and for babies. There are also delicious foods there, but mostly fast food, meat and junk food. Some attractions are for babies , for example, the ‚Äú It‚Äôs a small world ‚Äù attraction, even though it is for children, adult still rides on it because it is very beautiful inside. There are also many exciting attractions, if you don‚Äôt get a fastpass for popular rides, you will need to wait for a very long time to go in that ride. There are many kinds of rides that need a fastpass but if you don‚Äôt want to go on it that much, then don‚Äôt go.There are also many kinds of shows, but mostly for children, adults may not like it, but if you like with people dancing around in dresses, then go watch. 	This is where you should go for a vacation, where you should take your family and just rest and stay away from school or work. Where dreams come true!"
2136,5,14-Nov,Thailand,"Tokyo Disney Land , Cant have enough of it . "" Officially The Dream Place ""","The first time that i went to Tokyo Disneyland was in the year 2011 on my christmas break . I  had a lot of fun in Tokyo Disneyland . The surroundings and the environment are clean , and that tie the weather was nice , it wasn‚Äôt a freezing cold temperature . Just chilly and a bit cold , maybe -1 to -3 celsius . Not just the weather that was nice .The food there, the rides and the night time parade was also very good . I played on a lot of rides .I recommend the Space Mountain , The Big Thunder Mountain and many more . I recommend for you to not go so early , stay till the night time . Because at night there will be a Disney night parade . Where you could see Disney characters on floats . Which Is very pretty . When I went to Disneyland and Disney I always play the full day ! I can't get enough of it ! So I recommend to go there !"
2137,5,15-Oct,United Kingdom,"Great Day, but very tiring","We spent one day here and one at DisneySea. It's so packed even on a week day. I'm not even sure why it's so packed. I think it's mostly tourist but there were so many children everywhere!! I didn't think it was a school holiday time at the end of Sept but apparently it must be?? Be prepared to wait at least an hour for every single ride. Some of them had queues of 80mins!! Nearer the end of the night and closer to parade time, the queues died down and we were able to get on wuite a few of the ""sit and watch"" rides quite quickly. You HAVE to go on the winnie the pooh ride. It was good. But not worth a 2 hr wait!All in all a great day. Shame it rained when we went and we didn't get to see the electric light parade :("
2138,5,15-Sep,Australia,Amazing Disney Experience,"We recently visited Tokyo Disneyland with our 3 year old and our 8 month old, and had the most incredible experience. We had 3-day Magic Passports, and visited the park on Day 2 & 3, as it seemed to resonate with the 3 year old more so than DisneySea. If I had to sum up our experience in one word, it would be ""Magical"".  Our 3 year old was able to ride a lot of the attractions - and we were pleasantly surprised that the queues for the smaller attractions were not all that long, especially on Day 3 when it was raining.  FastPasses made the bigger attractions more achievable with 2 small children in tow - we used these to ride Monsters Inc, Splash Mountain, Star Tours and Pooh's Hunny Hunt at various times.One thing to note, is that this park is almost entirely in Japanese.  All the voiceovers on the rides are in Japanese, as are the shows.  Also, there are very few cast members that speak more than minimal English - this only proved to be an issue when we had a problem on one of the attractions.  After our whole family rode Pooh's Hunny Hunt on our first day at Disneyland, we enjoyed it so much, that we went to get FastPasses for it on the next day. We were clear that the restriction states that babies must be able to sit unassisted on a moving object - which we were certain that our 8 month old could do, and indeed there was no issue with him riding the first day. However, on the second day, once we were loaded onto the ride (my mum and the 3 year old in front, and my husband, the baby and I at the back), they asked my husband and I to lift up our hands to show that the baby was sitting unassisted - which he was. We got to the final safety check and the cast members motioned for my husband, baby and I to get off the ride...which we did, but with no explanation from the cast members and then the ride went off with my mum and toddler still on board. NOBODY at the ride could explain to us why we were taken off the ride. We got palmed off from one cast member to the next. Eventually we left to go meet up with my mum and toddler, which was a mission in itself, as they had finished the ride and had no idea where we were. We visited the Information centre, where an English speaking cast member was really helpful and contacted the ride and explained to us that babies riding is at the cast members' discretion, and they were being stricter today than they were yesterday, and that none of the cast members had actually understood us when we told them that the baby had gone on yesterday. I am ALL for safety on these things - my issue is NOT with our baby having not been allowed to ride - rather, I am thankful that we had FastPasses and didn't wait 90 minutes in line for this to happen. My feedback to the cast member is that if they are going to screen and safety check, this needs to happen much earlier in the process of lining up. My other issue is that they separated our party without any explanation at the time. Having said all of this, this was not enough to really detract from our days at Disneyland - we had an incredible family holiday, despite one disappointing incident.The park itself is accessible by public transport, and the monorail from the nearby hotels (where we stayed) makes it super easy to take breaks throughout the day when travelling with young children. We felt that food and merchandise was really well priced compared to other theme parks that we have been to - and there is a shopping centre near by for more food options."
2139,5,15-Oct,Australia,After 6pm pass was excellent value!,"Visited with kids age 3 and 5, they loved it, especially the night light parade, which was very impressive, went on and on forever but the kids sat mesmerised the whole time. We got the after 6pm pass one night, then a day pass another day, highly recommend this option if you have time. After 6pm on a weeknight, we found very few long queues, didn't wait more than about 10 minutes for anything, including splash mountain, went on several rides, saw the night parade and the fireworks. Really good value, plus it meant we left earlier on the full day because we had already seen the night shows, with kids that age it helped to break it up. Went back on the full day and the lines were much longer but didn't mind so much because we had already done so many. Food places only seem to take cash, gift shops (heaps of them everywhere!!!) take credit cards. Long lines for meeting Mickey, about 45min in the middle of the day, and you only meet one character at a time. Also recommend staying at one of the hotels near Disney as it's nice to get back quickly after the kids are exhausted!"
2140,5,15-Oct,United States,Fun Day üòÄ,Great day. The entry price is only about $50 USD which is good and the tickets are easy to buy online and print. You have to pay to ride the monorail from the train station. The lines to rides get longer as the day goes on so get there early and pick your fav to do first up. They had the park decorated for Halloween which was a surprise. 
2141,4,15-Sep,Malaysia,Disney Adventure,"We covered Disneyland on first day. Long q to entrance. Luckily we bought tickets in the hotel. We got Fast Passes for Splash Mountain & Space Mountain as priority rides. Later the kids conquered Buzz Lightyears, Circuit Raceways & Gadget's Go Coaster and more.......Long day of fun with beautiful Disney Characters parades. The night performance on Once Upon A Time was top rated entertainment despite drizzling that night. This is a family bonding fun adventure. "
2142,5,15-Sep,Spain,Go in the Fall for the Character Free-for-all!,"We went to Tokyo for our Chueok (Korean Thanksgiving) break in late September. The day we were there, -everyone- seemed to be in costume! My daughter was in heaven--she had her picture taken with a Roger and Jessica Rabbit pair, Mike and Scully, a set of 4 Minnie Mouses (Mice?) and more princesses than you can shake a sceptre at. It turns out that there are 3ish weeks in later September and October when that is allowed, not all the time. The English language website is good, and it is worth going then. Great Disney--love the popcorn and containers, and food is very affordable compared to the parks in the US. Tickets are cheaper too. We had one of our best family Disney days ever."
2143,4,15-Sep,Australia,Travelling with a 5 year old ‚Äì tips from a first timer,"Check out the crowd calendar before you book. (Google Crowd Calendar Tokyo Disneyland and you should be able to find it). It will give you an indication of how busy it is expected to be when you are in Tokyo. We went on a lower crowd (green highlight day) and the crowds were quite bearable. There were very short queues for the loo (not 1 kilometre like I had heard!) Definitely avoid red coded days, if possible!Pre-purchase tickets online and print before you go. The website doesn‚Äôt seem to accept foreign Mastercards but did accept a foreign Visa card for me.Arrive around opening time. (Opening times differ daily, so check these before you go). The queues to enter are quite efficient and you get in quickly. It gets much busier as the day progresses and is quite busy by 2pm. Our 5 year-old could really only cope with about 5 hours at a time. We arrived at 9am and he was ready to leave by 2pm. We went to the night parade and castle illuminations on a different day, arriving at about 6pm.There is a lot of walking between sections of the park. If your child still fits in a stroller, then it‚Äôs advisable to take one. Most people tend to dress in Disney clothes. Kids t-shirts are available in the stores around the park from about 1300 yen to 1600 yen. Adults‚Äô sizes are from 2000 yen. (The Fashion shop has the best range). Many groups and families dress in matching t-shirts. It's fun to just watch what people are wearing.People start taking up position for the parade about an hour before it starts!  We joined in about 20 minutes before the parade and the crowd was about 6 deep. People are encouraged (and do) sit through the parade you still get a pretty good view (although may have people‚Äôs heads in your photos).Caf√© Orleans in Adventureland sells delicious chicken and salad crepes and always seemed to have short queues and seating available.Take some snacks with you that your children enjoy.Try out the different popcorn flavours ‚Äì curry, cappuccino, chocolate, caramel, butter and soy sauce.Fast passes are free but run out quickly. It seems possible to reserve a second ride a few hours after making your first fast pass reservation (even though you have not yet taken the first ride). Check the bottom of your first fastpass ticket for details. Try to have a look at the map before you go and work out which rides to go on. We were there on a non-holiday, week day, and the wait times for rides weren‚Äôt too bad. Pooh‚Äôs Honey Pot ride was the longest wait which was about 35 - 50 minutes. It was very good. You can get a fastpass for this ride (scan your ticket just opposite the ride). By about 10:30am the fastpasses were for 7:30-8:30pm.Our son found the Snow White ride with the wicked witch a bit scary and definitely didn‚Äôt want to do it a second time. He enjoyed It‚Äôs a Small World (10 minute wait), Tea Cup ride (20 minute wait), and the carousel (10 minute wait) which are all in Fantasyland. He didn‚Äôt particularly like the Pinocchio ride (10 minute wait).In Toontown we started to line up for Roger Rabbit‚Äôs CarToon Spin but the entry is really dark and he got quite scared and didn‚Äôt want to ride. He enjoyed the Gadget‚Äôs Go Coaster (which had a 5 minute wait when we were there and was very similar to Flounder‚Äôs Flying Fish Coaster at Disney Sea that we waited 25 minutes for the day before). Minimum height is 90cm. Our 5 year-old enjoyed ringing the bells and whistles in Donald‚Äôs Boat.  Chip and Dale‚Äôs Tree House is not very exciting and neither is Goofy‚Äôs Paint activity ‚Äì where you just shoot paint colours at a screen. In Adventureland, the Swiss Family Treehouse is much better and bigger than Chip and Dale‚Äôs house ‚Äì our son did it 3 times."
2144,4,15-Sep,New Zealand,"Heaps of fun, hardly any wait times if raining",My advice is to go on a weekday. But if you really want to go on the rides with out much wait time go when it was s raining. We went on a friday at the end of september arriving at about 9. There was no line for tickets. Because the wait times varied from 5 to 45 minutes ( for poohs honey and space mountain only) we ended up going on most rides. We could of kept going but were tired by 5.30. It was a warm day despite the rain. The only annoying thing was being told to take my light weight jacket off on all the rides. But were allowed to take it as well as bags on all the rides.Felt the snacks there were a reasonable priced. And had no trouble finding a seat.However disapointed that there were no characters walking around at all. Possibly because of the rain? But surely they could stand in a covered in area.If you don't speak japanese don't line up for the stitch encounter. Its not a ride just an interactive meet and greet with a computerized stitch and audience participation. The staff were friendly so overall a good day.
2145,4,15-Oct,New Zealand,Some tips,"Bring your own water bottle there are lots of free areas to fill it. You can bring your own snacks, food as well.Bring cash if your a tourist, the atms are a hassleArrive early(before it opens) get in a line for one of the big rides quickly and grab your first fast pass.Always make sure you are holding one fast pass, two when possible. They are  a bit of paper you get at the ride which allows you to return at a specific time and skip the line. The fast pass will have a time printed at the bottom which tells you when you can collect your next one. The longest we waited for any ride was 40 mins by using fast passes over a entire day.When your waiting for your next fast pass time, watch the parades, the Japanese take them seriously, they are way better than Disney in LA and you dont have to wait in a line.You can take your backpack on all the rides, you dont need to put it in a locker. You can just hold glasses, caps etcEat the popcorn, its really good and they have a different flavour in each area, choclate, curry, caramel.Its Disneyland, stuff costs. Be prepared when lunch isnt a bargin and there is a line.There is a free Fireworks display at night, its really good. My 14 year old sister said it was the best day of her life"
2146,2,15-Oct,N/A,Far too many people,"We were disappointed and had higher expectations for Disneyland. The lines for the rides were just far too long with some rides having a minimum of 2hrs wait. It was even too busy for the fast pass. I would recommend if you are going to go, make sure you are there early! "
2147,5,15-Apr,Australia,Always fun!,"It is always fun to visit there. At the show lunch ""Lilo's Luau Fun"" at Polynesian terrace restaurant (you need to book advance for those show restaurant), Mickey, Minnie, Lilo, Stich and some more characters come to each table, so that you can take great photos witht them!"
2148,4,14-Nov,N/A,Go to a place where you can have one of your best memories with your friends or families ever!,"Tokyo disney lands can be one of the best attractions in Japan ever! Well, even you have a small kids, there is really many kinds of attraction for small kids to play too! Hours open are from 8 in the morning, until 10 in the night. My recommendation is to go there in the morning or night, because its crowded the most on the noon(12 pm)."
2149,5,14-Nov,N/A,Tokyo Disneyland is Fun,"Tokyo disneyland is a best place for the kids to play and have some fun. There are many things to play such as Peter Pan, Winnie the Pooh, Alice in the wonder world, small world. For the adults, there are Space Mountain, and many more roller coaster. Tokyo Disneyland also have plenty delicious dishes to eat, if we want to rest, there will be a place for you to rest everywhere and there will also be a things to buy too. I went there before, i go with my family, and it‚Äôs very fun, I have lots of feeling when I arrive there, excitement, fun, happy and I don‚Äôt want to leave this place. there will also be a parade, the customers will wear a disney character and there will be a car that they ride on it. About 3:00 pm, there will be a firework and it‚Äôs very beautiful, they opened a song. I recommended this because it was a nice and fun place for the visitors to play."
2150,4,15-Jan,N/A,Disney Magic,"If you are looking for thrill rides, please do not come here after visiting Fuji-Q Highland. It will not do yourself any justice. The best part about Tokyo Disneyland is that it is huge and it will take you from opening hour till night to finish it all. The park is quite dated but it is still refreshing especially the new Star Wars ride. The popcorn was great with multiple choice like Japanese soy sauce and curry flavor. We basically went hunting for all the flavors. Something to ponder is that the queues can be overwhelming, especially during winter. Most of the lines started from open area, it means you will be freezing for most of the time. Always love the parade especially the fireworks, and it is worth every disneyland visit. Make sure to have the best sit/stand position to really enjoy it, I prefer to stand a bit far from the path to take the pictures.The park is old, however to compare to the new Disneyland Hong Kong, I could say it is much better. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The food at the Blue Bayou is delicious. It will be a definite stop to enjoy the Disney Magic in Tokyo, I guess I will come during the Spring or Summer next time."
2151,3,15-Oct,Australia,Didnt blow my mind,The rides were well done and the robotics were amazing but not many thrills to be found here. Got turned off by having to wait so long in the lines and left early. Pirates of the Caribbean was def my fave ride.Warning for overseas visitors. Nowhere in disneyland would accept my mastercard. Luckily we had enough cash to get in n buy food but unfortunately couldnt get any merchandise
2152,4,15-Sep,N/A,Where dreams come true..except getting cash out ,"Tokyo Disneyland was amazing, I loved the spirit of the staff, characters and even if all the locals! Everyone dresses up and are very animated. My husband and I currently live in Japan and have never had trouble getting cash... Except for anywhere near Disneyland/sea. If you are a foreigner outside of Japan and China, the ATM machines do not accept you're cards to get cash out so be sure to have enough cash on hand. Inside the resort they take card as payment but getting cash out is a no go. Other then that, it was great! And I will definitely return with more family :) "
2153,3,15-Sep,Brazil,Don't achieved my expectatives ,"The park it's too small, it's too crowd and the employees don't speak english or spanish. The only thing that I apreciatted was the castle show. "
2154,5,15-Sep,Australia,One of the life time experience at this Magical world,"The Crowd, the visitors dresses like Disney Characters, the attractions.. everything amused us. We went with our 3 year old son and he enjoyed a lot. The only mistake we did was choosing a Saturday to go there, though we were having tickets, it took an hour to access entry inside the entrance (they had 10-15 entrances).The Parades takes you to a different world, especially the night parade with huge Disney characters decorated with glittering bulbs gives a WOW experience. If you could Don't miss the night parade, it was around 08:30 to 09:00Pm in the night.Being a Saturday, there was long wait of more than 30 minutes for few attractions but it din't bothered us. "
2155,1,15-Sep,Australia,Absolute waste of a day and money,"If you feel like paying $270 aud, for a family of 4 to stand in lines all day, then this is for you. We arrived at gates open, lined up for 30 mins to get in with pre payed tickets, arrived at the first ride, the wait was 2hrs 40 mins, and the queues just get longer as the day goes on.Very understaffed, and if not for the large number of gift shops, there is nothing particularly ""Disney"" here. We managed to get in 4 rides all day and left feeling extremely underwhelmed. If you are heading to Japan for a holiday, give this a wide berth and save your time for seeing the country and take the kids to a regular amusement park when you get home. There is certainly nothing special about this park."
2156,4,15-Jul,Australia,Tokyo Disneyland really is the hapiest place on Earth,"Our family loved this place, and were impressed with how cheerful, enthusiastic & helpful the staff were. The parade was better than I could've imagined. Big Thunder Mountain & Splash Mountain were the both awesome rides. Stayed at the nearby Hilton Tokyo Bay, using the free Hilton or Mickey buses to get to Disneyland or the monorail for Disney Sea."
2157,5,14-Dec,N/A,Amazing Disneyland!!,I visited Disneyland Tokyo with my friends from Japan and I am happy to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The rides are amazing and the atmosphere is one of fun and excitement.. Can't wait to be back again!!
2158,5,N/A,India,Great place to visit in Tokyo,Disneyland and Disney-sea are two separate in Tokyo and cannot be covered in 1 day. Disneyland is great but queues at attractions is long so its better to be reach there early morning. Evening parade was best part of Disneyland. Don't miss the Cinderella show just after the evening parade.
2159,2,15-Sep,Australia,Waste of time,This place is a scam. Don't waste your time if you have visited the other disneylands. It has nothing special. The queues are ridiculous. Do the maths. 90 mins queuing for the good rides. 2 mins of fun. 6 hours of queuing for 8 mins of fun. And the locals get here at 6am and make use of a fast pass.  So if the queue says 90 minutes u will stand there and watch 300 locals walk in front of u. So disappointing for children. Don't put your children through this place. The price works out to be like $10 per person per ride. If u r lucky. Very very limited vegetarian food. Only pasta in the east side cafe. And it's a set menu at 2040 yen. If u have never been to Disneyland then it's a must for your children. If u have been to any other theme park then skip this waste of time. How dare the owners let so many people in and charge so much and make us wait so long. It's owned by Japanese. Not Disney. Paris kills this place. It is a compete rip off. 
2160,5,15-Sep,Australia,As good as usual! Go if it's pouring for the shortest lines!,"Anytime Disneyland is involved, it gets five stars, it was awesome, great rides, classics for little kids. If you are going here's what we found:Definitely need a full day for the whole experience (the fireworks at night weren't worth waiting for)This Disneyland has a really short height minimum, meaning really young kids can go on everything (pretty sure it was 90cm minimum)!Having been to Anaheim and Hong Kong disneylands, I'd take my kids to this one over both of the others. Pack basic snacks if you can, unless you like the idea of eating shrimp sandwiches for every meal. There are a few other types of food, but the hot dogs aren't what westerners are used to and the portions of chips won't get you by all day.Go on the worst weather possible so the queues for the rides are under 90 mins! We were there in rain coats and umbrellas and it was the best! "
2161,5,14-Dec,Singapore,Busy but Beautiful,"Whatever it is, plan plan plan.Go as early as you can and join the queues. Take note of the newest or most popular rides and make a dash for it to get the fastpass ticket. Thereafter, go for the less popular rides and do the same after the next opportunity to get a fastpass ticket again. This strategy worked for us and we managed to do most of the rides we had planned to take.I particularly loved Winnie the Pooh and It's a Small World. The park is clean but a bit cramped when all the guests are in during the peak period."
2162,4,14-Oct,Australia,Magic of Disney but just too busy,We love Disney and there was the magic. But just too many people and too many queues. Not the experience Walt Disney wanted people to experience. 
2163,3,15-Sep,Australia,Astronomical queues,Went to Disneysea on a Friday in the rain and not in a local school holiday period. The Disney website said medium busy at 74.  Got there at opening time raced to toymania ride.  It took 45min just to get the fast pass. Then went to journey to the centre of the earth and that took 95 minutes in the queue.It's a tough day for adults but the kids loved the trip.
2164,5,15-Jul,Australia,Great value,"Typical Disneyland but always with something different over other Disneyland parks.I prefered Disneysea but the rest of the family preferred Disneyland.Have done Disneyland in California and Florida, All are different but similar, they never get boring. Spent 3 days here and 2 at Disneysea. I found it much better value than in the US.."
2165,5,15-Apr,Japan,Kids Loved It,"Our kids had a blast at Tokyo Disneyland. It is very similar to the one in America, but much smaller. The size makes it easy to become crowded and for lines to get excessively long. It was very busy the day we went, but it was still a ton of fun and we couldn't have asked for a better day.  Certainly worth visiting at least once. "
2166,5,15-Sep,New Zealand,This is my favourite Disneyland!,"I wasn't expecting it, but this was my favourite Disneyland.  You could get proper, fresh food, the people seemed to be genuinely helpful and fun, and by googling for expected crowd sizes we went on a quite day and found our average waiting time was less than ten minutes"
2167,5,15-Sep,Australia,Fun!,Lots of fun. Very busy and lots of lines for the big attractions but if you plan the fastpass access well it isn't too bad. Always a good time at Disney parks! Loved the different flavours of popcorn too!
2168,5,15-Sep,Singapore,2 days is not enough to visit this magical place,"2.5 times bigger than the one in HK. The crowd at Tokyo Disneyland are mainly Japanese. The shows and parades are a must, though they are in Japanese but equally entertaining and fun to watch. It is very crowded whole day whole year, best to go during off peak (non-Japan holidays since majority are local residents)"
2169,5,15-Sep,United Kingdom,A perfect Disney day,"This is the best Disney park I have experienced - I'm a big fan of Disney theme parks and regularly visit Disneyland Paris. The Tokyo park seems to do everything on a bigger, more detailed scale than even its excellent global counterparts. You can tell that no expense has been spared here. A beautiful, well maintained park with cast members that could not be faulted. Every single one seems to love their job and exudes energy and fun. We were a bit worried about the crowds but fast passes helped, and we managed to cram a lot of attractions into one day. Don't miss the One Man's Dream show or Once Upon a Time at night. The popcorn and other snacks are amazing!!"
2170,2,15-Sep,Canada,Doesn't seem like tourists are welcome here,"We planned a trip to celebrate my daughters birthday. The only highlight was the service we received when collecting her birthday package from the gift shop. Besides that no international ATM on site, very hard to get an English guide or any assistance, rides that went out of service with no communication for over 1 hr. It seems like they don't want tourists to visit this park and it is geared towards locals only. Disappointed with Disney."
2171,5,15-Sep,N/A,Lots to see and do,"The parades and rides are a wonderful spectacle, for the popular rides make sure you fast pass early. There are lots of merchandise stores and food outlets. It's pretty much what you'd expect."
2172,4,15-Jun,N/A,Must visit ,Theme park is old but still relevant to tourists who are keen on reliving their childhood. The food at the theme park is great and priced reasonably. Some of the attractions are in Japanese only which makes it slightly disappointing.
2173,4,15-Jul,Indonesia,The Second Most Iconic Theme Park in Tokyo,"Not bad... But, most of the attractions here are for kids... Pity... But, you can enjoy the parades, especially on summer. "
2174,4,15-Sep,N/A,Im an epic disney fan so i kinda died!!!!!,"So, i read quite a few mixed reviews on tripadvisor and it had me a  it freaked out, so here is my experience. Staff super friendly if they could speak english (majority could atleast a little bit) everyone was helpful and super smiley. The parades where AMAZING!!!!! The energy and the sheer size were fantastic! Food not too expensive at all a very affordable day other than the ticket and plenty of theme park food (curry flavoured popcorn holly molly) it was deffinetly a kids theme park but its an experience im glad ive had. ive been to DISNEY LAND and in tokyo and totally lived upto what i expected!!! An experience no one should miss "
2175,3,15-Sep,United Kingdom,Not a patch on Florida,"Only got to run round here for a few hours before having to catch a flight home.  Queues were already forming 2hours before the park opened.  Also you can't get the cookies and other types of sweet things that you get in the states, here you have to buy tins of biscuits and sweets so its a bit on the expensive side to take any presents home for kids.... (or adults).  Any food I had while here was reasonable quality and not overly expensive for what it was.  Rides are ok but an awful let here geared towards smaller kids and rollercoasters etc don't seem to be as fun or as long lasting as the rides at the parks in florida."
2176,3,15-Mar,Indonesia,Japanese theme park,"Everything is in Japanese! The playground is actually very big (and there are two!), but for a foreigner that don't speak any Japanese, it would be hard to understand some of the attraction."
2177,5,15-Feb,Philippines,fun fun fun!,bring refillable water bottles...be very early as queue lines are long even on weekdays! use fast pass as much as possible to maximize your rides at the theme park
2178,3,15-Aug,Philippines,This place is huge,"This place is huge. Overall, it was a great experience,but I still prefer HK Disneyland's entertainment over this one. "
2179,3,15-Sep,Australia,Disney Sea: lining up for 1 to 2.5  hours,"I was surprised that the most popular rides (Toy Story, Tower of Terror ) were 2.5  hours in line, even at around 8 pm  when we were leaving.  It was 45  minutes for 20,000 leagues which was just ok and 40 minutes to get a photo with Mickey. lines for seating at the shows were 1-2  hours which in this heat seems not worth it.The other disappointment was how little ""Disney"" themes were in the attractions. It was more like a generic adventure park."
2180,1,15-Jan,Singapore,Tokyo Disneyland Staff is very rude!!!,"I come from Singapore. I traveled to Tokyo Disneyland this year, when I queue up to take photo with mickey mouse, someone jump the queue. I tell the staff in Disneyland, they ignore my complaint and blame me. The staff in Tokyo Disneyland is very rude, and they use a camera to take video on us. They are not respect to customer. I will never go to Disneyland again!!!"
2181,4,15-Aug,New Zealand,Use Fastpas to Avoid Delays,I'm not a huge fan of theme parks but my wife is. Some amazing rides and features bu make sure you us the fast pass system if you want to avoid hours of queuing up. Definitely worth entering the lottery to get seats for the evening Once Upon A Time show
2182,5,15-Jul,N/A,Awsome end to a holiday,"I went on a weekday so there wasn't a huge crowd that I had expected, and the waiting time wasn't very long. However Stich encounter would have the longest wait if you are interested. Managed to catch almost all of the parades they had going on at that time.There are certain shows that has reserved seating that requires balloting. The tickets can be obtained at Tomorrowland. There would be someone to direct you on how to operate the machine."
2183,5,15-Aug,Taiwan,So many people!!!,"I guess it's the same for all the Disney locations in the world.  For our entire trip, i think my son had the most wonderful time here as there are plenty of attractions, rides and things to see.  The parade was fun to watch and you'd really enjoy the happiness they bring to the crowd.  For adults, i am not sure if i'd recommend but if it's a family trip, it's worth to visit if you are in Tokyo.  Try to avoid to come on the weekends.  We spent 3 days in Tokyo Disney, 1st day (Thursday) in the sea world, 2nd day the disney and 3rd day (Saturday) we went to both locations.  We felt there were 50% more people on the Saturday and some hot rides, we had to wait until 1pm even though we got the fast pass by 9am.  Overall, it's a great place to come and enjoy the Disney!!!!"
2184,4,14-Oct,N/A,"Clean, so very clean","The one thing that surprised me most in Tokyo was the level of cleanliness. But Disneyland took this several steps further. Not one piece of gum, not even one crumbled chockolate paper in sight. I mean IT'S CLEAN. The downside to all this is that during the summer season the lines are very, very, very long. Don't bother coming if you don't plan to buy a Fast Pass ( which lets you skip the lines). Otherwise be prepared to wait 60 - 120 minutes for a ride. That being said, The Tokyo Disneyland is a great place to visit with children. Everything is neat and...yes, you guessed it, CLEAN. The staff does NOT speak english, but most of the rides and restaurants have english signs / menues.  One other thing, Tokyo Disneyland is not located in ¬´central Toky¬ª, so prepare yourself for a 40-50 minutes train ride from Tokyo Station."
2185,5,15-Sep,Philippines,Must visit!!,"I've only been to the one in HK, and the one in Tokyo is definitely way, way better. Check online to see the best rides, and make sure to use your Fast Pass as much as you can, because lines can be long. Our favorite ride was the Star Tours one. The shows were great, too! My favorites were the Storybook show at the end and the Electric Lights Parade. Make sure to get good vantage points for those two!"
2186,1,15-Aug,Australia,Save your Money and Sanity and Avoid Tokyo Disney Land,"Customer service is really poor and not accommodating of young children.We went on a day that was raining and my 5 year old son slipped and hurt his ankle.  I went to Customer Services to hire a pram. They refused to lend one saying he was 15cm too tall. Despite seeing many Japanese families using the hire prams with taller/older children. So we asked for a wheel chair and had the same response 'No'. This left us with the difficult job of carrying our child around Tokyo Disney Land and waiting in the long lines... Actually we couldn't even do this!!! While waiting in line for a ride, I had a Disney worker request that I not carry my child?!? So I could not hire anything to help his condition nor could I carry him. Beyond belief, I still can not make sense of this.Because of this, our trip could only last a few hours, despite paying hundreds for the tickets. And we only managed to get on 2 rides during this time. There are so many more interesting, cheaper and authentic Japanese experiences to have whilst in Japan."
2187,5,15-Sep,Malaysia,Must must must visit..but,"1)The rides are okay, but the line is very long, you must wait from 60min to 120min.2)Huge place for u to explore.3)If you are pregnant and wish to see more character like mickey or donald duck, they are not that available in the park. Dont know why but they seldom go out to meet fans.4) Food was okay,little pricey. 5)Stuff was friendly and helpful BUT u can't really use Go Pro here cuz they thought that its disturbing other people. The staff will come to you and they tell dont use Go Pro in the park.6)The toilet was clean.. "
2188,5,15-May,Germany,lovely,my children love to go Disneyland very much..It was a wonderful place for children...we would like to go back there again!!
2189,5,14-Nov,United Arab Emirates,LOVE Disney,I have been to the Disneyland in California many times. I was so excited to get to see it in Tokyo.  The lines were long here but it was an amazing day. I would recommend that you make sure you get enough rest for your whole day here. My husband and I crashed at lunch time. I wish we would of stayed by the park so we could take a quick nap. We ended up not staying in the park as late as i wished. I can't wait to go back someday!!!
2190,4,15-May,Japan,Affordable fun,"The best thing about Tokyo Disneyland is that it's about half the price of the one in California, and easily accessible by train and bus.  The fireworks and the parade are also a little earlier making it easier to visit with small children.  The park is always clean, the attractions are fun and the shops are filled with stuff you probably don't really need but want to buy anyway.  There are even some tables set up right outside of the park so you can skip out, eat the lunch you brought with you and come back in if you want to avoid the long restaurant lines and high cost of food.  The only problem is that it is TOKYO Disneyland, so the lines can be VERY long.  If you come on a weekend or holiday prepare to wait up to 4 or more hours for the major attractions and over 30 minutes for even the smaller ones.  Come off season, come on a weekday, come on a day where the weather is not so great in the morning and you'll love it here."
2191,1,15-Jul,Denmark,Terrible!!!,"Had high expectations visiting Disneyland Tokyo, already my family had tried the Orlando, Paris and Hong Kong, but found Tokyo to be completely different from the other very well organised parks!1st:We encountered probably 30-40 VERY smiling staff members, but NONE of them spoke one word of english. They kicked my 23 month daughter of the ""castle carrousel"", because we couldn't communicate with the staff that we would have to be seated on the outer ring, as she need an adult behind her!!! I tried to order a burger without tomatoes - IMPOSSIBLE!!!2nd:In Disneyland Tokyo there are absolutely NO attractions for kids above 5 years! Everything is focused on small kids!3rd:Standing in a line is normally something the Japanese handles very well, but in Disneyland everybody is standing in line everywhere - we even visited on a rainy weekday - but still no organisation of the lining up - only a few confused teenagers without ANY english capabilities!All in all total surprise with such a poor performance by Disney! We had 5 extremely disappointed kids when we left - very different from our target when we entered!So if you are in Tokyo and want action and fun - go to a train station during rush hour or go to the streets of Ginza, BUT avoid Disney unless you have infants that speak fluent Japanese..."
2192,3,15-Aug,United Kingdom,Slightly disappointing,"Having had some free time whilst travelling in Japan and being a lover of all things rollercoaster I was disappointed with the level of attraction available over other Disney Parks I've been to. It hit its market of kids extremely well, but there was a lack of rides that adults could do!"
2193,4,15-Aug,United Kingdom,Very Clean,"I've always wanted to go to Tokyo Disneyland since I was a kid, finally in my mid forties I got to go. We purchased a 3 day pass for Disney Sea and Disneyland and you definitely need at least the 3 days to see everything. We booked and paid for without realising it was the School Holidays!! It was extremely crowded, so strongly recommend not to go in their School Hols - I hope it would be less busy, queues for rides were over 2 hours, we didn't bother waiting in line. We managed to suss the Fastpast ticketing, worth it if you can get them at a reasonable time, but you cant have more that one fastpast ticket at a time so choose carefully. We queued up for less popular rides and they were fun, the steam train and river cruise etc. Pirates of the Carabian was well done and had a very close Johnny Depp look alike character. You do need patience and definitely good walking shoes. Both parks are immaculate clean and the staff are super friendly. Do some research online and check out the rides the night before so you can eliminate the ones you don't want to go on. I also checked online where to get the English map. If you are staying at the Disney resorts you need money to get the monorail pass (it doesn't take credit card). Evening show with the Disney castle is amazing - we were fortunate enough to get a seat - recommend trying for the ""lotto"" at winning a seat. Go early to try I think it is reasonably easy to win and well worth a good spot. My need a cushion for seat is hard."
2194,5,15-Jul,China,First visit and we loved it!,"Upon my daughter's request, I planned a trip to Tokyo with one main objective is to visit the ""happiest place on earth"".Did a search and found Sheraton Tokyo Bay and I booked us for a week's stay there. As we are expected to arrive late in the afternoon or early evening, we knew nothing can be done on the arrival day. As Sheraton is one of the partner hotels for the resort, tickets for the park are available for purchase at the lobby. The counter is just next to the main check in counter at the main lobby of the hotel.To get to the hotel, there are buses from both Narita and Haneda airports. We found information from the Starwood Preferred Guests website while checking out Sheraton Hotel information. It is convenient and the bus was comfortable.We bought the 4-day pass with selection of first two days for the dry park (Tokyo Disneyland - TDL) and the remaining two days for the wet park (Tokyo Disney Sea - TDS). Actually the last day is open for either of the park. From the hotel, there is a bus which loops between the hotel and the monorail station which actually is only 5 minutes walk from the hotel. And the monorail loops the parks. Ikspiari which is a mall, has some shopping choices as well as dining choices is one of the stops.As we were there during the summer, the weather was rather hot but there were some light rain in the first few days we were there which helped to keep us cool. The best thing was my daughter didn't mind getting a little wet. As she already had a plan on the rides and places she wants to visit (she did her research prior to the trip and made a list), we zoomed into those rides and attractions.Both TDL and TDS is as expected family friendly but in the end we prefer TDS. Food choices are plenty in both parks but TDS serves alcohol (beer, wine, sake) in some of the restaurants. The Italian inspired town when you entered the TDS is beautiful and actually made me feel like I am in and Italian town, in fact they even have a gondola ride which unfortunately was closed for works. One of the food that is a must eat in TDS is the oversized long-ish gyoza bun (kinda like a hotdog) which is a bun (kind of like Chinese steamed bun) with pork filling. It was super yummy! And the fried chicken in the same park too. Over-all the food are good in both parks but we prefer those in TDS. We also had a dinner in the Japanese restaurant in TDS and I had ""frozen beer"" because it's summer.In the end we purchased another ticket for 3 more days and we covered almost all the rides and attractions. We were also lucky as at the time we visited the place (beginning of July), Japanese school holidays hasn't started and there were also less foreign visitors. So the queues were not so bad except for a few of the super popular rides which we waited for more than 50 minutes. Most of the rides we waited on the average 15 minutes.We experienced the spring festival and the summer festival during our visit and it was most fun! The parades are wonderful, the night shows are beautiful. You could make a lottery for seats for the night shows in both parks which is very good as with luck, you will get a seat without obstructions to view the full glory of the shows and we were lucky to obtain seats for one of the nights.The parks were exceptionally clean, people were polite, food was good, rides were fun, all in all, it was fun through out and my daughter is already talking about how Autumn festival and Winter Festival experience will be, so we are definitely going to plan for another trip."
2195,3,15-Jan,Australia,I guess you gotta like this stuff,"Ok, let me be up front. I got dragged here, if it had been my choice we'd have tried climbing Fuji, but alas......We didn't have a large window in Tokyo so we managed to get tickets on a public holiday. Better arrive early we thought, to avoid the inevitable crowds.Well we arrived early, but not early enough, how many people were in front of us, well I don't know but it was in the tens of thousands without a doubt.Being Japanese they were all having a great time queueing, it's an experience in itself apparently. And queueing was certainly the theme of the day.While everybody rushed to what ever the newest ride was, we snuck off in the other direction and jumped on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, after only a 15 minute wait. The shortest of the day.Eh, it was ok.Anyway I followed the missus around, took some snapshots, stood in lots of lines, and popped a few aspirin.Oh the lines, a three hour wait for the rides, there were even hour queues at the popcorn vendors.The locals take it all in their stride, me I chose to forgo most rides a skip the popcorn altogether.It's Disney World, I guess it's exactly what you expect and very much influenced by the preconceived notions you have before going in.I can see how people would love it, and kids must almost explode with everything going on. But it isn't really for me."
2196,4,15-Aug,Australia,Dress up in Disney and pay a visit,So so so much fun. Lots on long waits for rides so consider purchasing a fast pass. Beautiful and clean. Everyone dresses up. Was a great day. Prices are reasonable and the monorail to the parks is fast and enjoyable.
2197,5,14-Sep,United States,Disney World meets Univerisal Studios,"Tokyo Disneyland is not just Disney World Tokyo, the rides here are way more intense than your typical Orlando variety.  The special efects are also newer and better."
2198,5,15-Jul,Philippines,Tiring but worth it!!!,"It's my 1st Disneyland though I'd been to California and Hongkong. We visited here last July, it's quite crowded because school summer vacation starts already and the following day is Holiday. My young kids even my hubby really enjoyed our trip here. Alot of rides, things to do, several restaurants and booths. In every themed location, they have souvenir shops and restaurants. Note: If you want to try all the rides, you better get the 2 day pass. And maybe, you can wear comfortable shoes and clothing to enjoy at its best.Next time we're going to check on the Disney Sea."
2199,5,14-Sep,Australia,Disneyland Tokyo,"Didn't plan to go here as have been to Anaheim and Florida but we had a day to spare. It ended up being a great day as the tourists were as much of an attraction as the Disney characters.  Everyone goes dressed up in their best Disney gear or heads to the shops to buy matching hats, shirts and accessories. Well worth a visit, it's not as. If as the USA ones but just as well done."
2200,5,15-Jun,United States,Vastly superior to its American counterparts,"You have to admit when you're beat, and when it comes to Disney parks, Tokyo Disneyland makes the Anaheim Disneyland and the Orlando Magic Kingdom look like run-down carnivals. It's simply better run, bigger, cleaner, and newer.  Just walking down Main St. you are immediately struck by how much more majestic it is. Its version of the Sleeping Beauty castle actually looks like a real European castle. It's a grand centerpiece to the park, and in front of it is a large outdoor seating area with benches where people can gather to watch fireworks. There is also a display board which lists all the wait times and fastpass times in one place which is great for planning. The general layout of the lands and rides follow the same basic circular format as the other Disney parks.  Make sure you get an English map at the entrance. If you get lost though just about all the Disney employees understand enough Disney-fied English to direct you to where you need to go. Most of the rides are more or less identical to their American versions with minor variations (and of course language variations). The exceptions are Pooh's Hunny Hunt and the Monsters Inc. ride. These are unique to Tokyo Disneyland and are must sees when visiting. They also have the longest lines so use your fastpasses to see them. Definitely print multiple copies of your park tickets at home and bring them with you so you can skip buying tickets and go straight in. The printed ticket bar codes are also what you use to scan for fastpasses. Like DisneySea, there is an online crowd calendar for Disneyland which projects the crowds on any given day (just search ""Tokyo Disneyland crowd calendar""). Heed this crowd calendar well because it can make your trip awesome or a nightmare. We went in June on a weekday when the calendar was Green and the crowd number was in the low 50s. Absolutely avoid Red dates with numbers > 80s.  Just don't even bother going. Change your plans. Even on a green day lines sometimes exceeded 60 min on the big rides although for the most part the lines weren't bad especially early and late. In the afternoons Japanese school kids show up after school (they are in school until July) and that's when you get the worst crowds. If you stay at a Disney resort hotel you get a measly 15 minute head start on everyone else at park opening. Tokyo Disney isn't so much drastically different in content than other Disney parks so much as it's just nicer. And oh btw, the park tickets are half the price of Disney tickets in the states. Our kids loved it and voted that they'd rather go back to Tokyo over Orlando. That says it all right there."
2201,5,15-Jul,N/A,Unforgettable day,"This is the second Disneyland I have been to after Hong Kong Disneyland. I went there on thursday 10am. Lines were manageable. Some of the rides, we just walked in. Monsters Uni had the longest line. Be sure to use the fastpass. Most rides are very Disney like and people dress up a lot. Awesome flavors of popcorn available. However, only tried the caramel one. Food is very decent and costy as it is a general trend in theme park. The evening show is awesome. You need to do a sort of lottery to get a seat beforehand. Loved there. Happiest place on earth."
2202,4,15-Aug,New Zealand,"Fun day out, but fast pass a bit of a joke","Went to Tokyo Disney on a weekday in mid August and it was packed. We'd heard about fast passes, but we didn't quite realise how it works. You have to find a fast pass ticket machine close to the attraction itself and then hold your entry ticket in the scanner. It will then spit out a fast pass ticket at whatever time is displayed above the machines. We didn't see that till after as our first fast pass was valid for 20:30-21:30 printed at 9:30am!!! That's one way to keep you there. Then there is a two and a bit hour wait until you can get your next pass. This meant that by the time we wanted to get a fast pass to splash mountain, the machine was closed as all fast passes had gone for the day. It was a very hot day so it figures, in hindsight, but didn't expect this as it wasn't even noon yet. The fast passes are great when you have them. When you don't, the heavy bias towards those who do gets quickly frustrating. The regular queue is called ""standby"" and that is how it's treated. Instead of a fairer, say 10 fast pass to 2 regular queue members, we counted as many as 80 fast pass holders with regular queue only admitted if there was no fast pass holders. This made for extreme queuing if you were unlucky enough to not have the magic fast pass, though I think individual staff also made a difference. It seems the power went to some of their heads. When you don't know the system (i.e. get there as early as possible and get fast passes to the biggest attractions first) it is frustrating. Nowhere did I read that fast passes run out or stop being issued, making the 2 hour limit a farce. That said, we did enjoy our day. Space tours is awesome, so is space mountain. The quaint steam train ride and a trip on the really quite authentic Mississippi paddle boat were probably my favourite. The park is sparkling clean and one gets the impression that the perpetual happiness required of a Disney theme park employees comes quite easily to the Japanese. The parade was good, though I really felt for the performers in the heat. Also quite surreal was the reaction of (mostly) Japanese park visitors at the unexpected sight is a couple of Disney character princesses and princes. The screaming and jostling for pictures and selfies briefly made us spectators to this display wonder if the crowd knew these were just actors dressed in costumes!! Good day out, decent food, though not cheap. But nowhere in Japan is. The popcorn seems to hold a weird fascination and comes in all flavours, from sickly sweet (and that's just the smell), to curry! Bring sun tan lotion, a refillable water bottle and patience. You'll have a great day :-)"
2203,4,15-Jul,United States,Finally we are here!,"Have been dreaming to visit Tokyo Disneyland for years and finally, we are here. However, not too impressed as the Disney Sea is way better and more fun. Also, make sure to watch out those Chinese Visitors who will cut your lines even you are watching them.  They do not care.  They will pretend to look at something in the front and cut your way out as they move forward.  Very bad experiences with them."
2204,5,15-Apr,United Kingdom,Amazing!!,"Fab time spent here - rained a little on the second day which meant the park was almost empty even though the rides were still running - result!!It has all the charm of disney, plus a few quirks that make it very japanese - the steamed prok mickey rolls were gorgeous!!!The popcorn always had a queue but it was definitely owrth it!Even though the shows were all in japanese we enjoyed each and every one - and although we couldnt understand them, the disney magic worked its wand for a very happy trip!!"
2205,4,15-Jan,Australia,Everything you would expect.,Everything is perfectly themed as you would assume.The park has many options to allow families and individuals of all budgets to still enjoy their day. biggest issue is the inevitable queuing
2206,4,15-Aug,Australia,Disney Sea - nice change from main st USA ,Opted for Disney Sea - good choice - very pleasant different Disney environment.  Enjoyed the Japanese obsession with getting you wet especially in the searing heat.  Yes long queues but felt we got to do enough and just really enjoyed wandering the grounds.  Loved the mermaid cave!
2207,3,15-Jun,United Kingdom,Busy Busy,"We have been to Walt Disney World, Disneyland Paris and Disneyland but we have never seen crowds like Tokyo. Fortunately we only went to experience it (as we have done alot of the rides elsewhere). Most of the popular rides were posting multiple HOUR waitsI dont think we will return"
2208,3,15-Aug,Yemen,Avoid going there if you can!,Thought would be great idea to go but i regret going there! First it's crowded as hell and this is not even the peak season yet!!!! you will have to wait in lines for minimum 45min up to 2 hours! and the funny thing is that people who have the FAST PASS as much as the people who have REGULAR PASS which means you will see lots and lots of people passing you while you waiting for your turn under the hot weather! on the top of that this place does not accept debit cards!I would recommend going to this place if you have kids and lots of time to spend in Tokyo otherwise there are few great theme parks and less crowded.
2209,4,14-Sep,Hungary,Another miracle of adventures,It is a good site to visit both with your family and friends. There are enough rides and entertaining shows for different age groups. Usually while waiting your queue you can approach to the staff and ask about fast track strip for your hand with indication of time when you come and take the ride without staying on the queue.
2210,5,14-Sep,Australia,Wonderful day out,"We had a tour bus take us out which was handy. The grounds are absolutely stunning and we had alot of fun. Some people visiting also dress up which adds more excitement to the day. Loved how everything was themed to Disney, even the food. Unfortunately the line ride was quite long so we didn't go on many, but we loved the shops and brought heaps. Wonderful day out! "
2211,5,15-Jan,Australia,Crazy busy,"we went on a Tuesday in winter and we're lucky not to wait 30mins for toddler rides. It was extremely busy, uncomfortably so, and full of teenagers. Hilarious things to see: the queues for popcorn (crazy) and signs saying rides had a 6+ hour wait. It is Disneyland, it was our first visit and we did leave having had a good time. I do think the park was too full and perhaps restricting visitors would be better for the general experience."
2212,5,15-May,Australia,Magic in Japan,"We travelled to Disneyland on a Tuesday in mid-May. Took the train from Shinjuku and it was relatively easy to navigate with all the signs. Once at Maihama station, Disneyland entrance is within walking distance. We arrived at the gate at 8:30 for a 9:00 open and by then there was already a large crowd queuing even though the weather was drizzly.Have an attraction-plan ready(like us) if you plan to ride all rides! We high-tailed to Monsters Inc first and worked our way around which worked for us and got most of the rides and shows. Utilised 3 of the fast-pass machines (Pooh's Hunt, Splash Mountain & Space Mountain). The whole park was always in a clean condition and the staff were very helpful. Average queue time for the popular rides got up to 40min. Food choices was good and prices are expected to be around AUD$15/dish as per theme park prices. Happiness on high parade was great! If you are here mainly for the parade, be sure to be early as most of the locals will be there waiting as soon as the park opens with their picnic rug! Enjoyed it even if we didn't stay for the fireworks."
2213,5,15-Jul,United Kingdom,Superb day - cheaper and less crowded than Paris,"Visited here with my wife and son. The only other Disney park we have been to is Paris. This was similar but about 20% cheaper. Food was far better than Paris and about half the price. We had been warned about queues in Tokyo but these were, once again, better than Paris. Star Tours was excellent - went twice and both voyages were different. Peter Pan not working when we were there but lots more to do. Fantastic electric parade at night. Spent about 12 hours there. Guides in various languages including English. About 15 minutes from the centre of Tokyo."
2214,5,15-Apr,Australia,Research rides and plan ahead would be helpfpul :),"Memorable trip, make sure you go to the lottery place (between the space mountain and the car track) to win a chance for your seat to see once upon a time night show which is spectacular!! I couldn't do everything that I want (only had 1,5 day here), I would recommend minimum 2 days to explore..."
2215,5,15-Aug,China,Welcome to paradise - Tokyo Disneyland~,"Really worth to have a visit to this place just like paradise.  The staff is so nice, friendly, and helpful; and there's lots of activities such as parade to have fun.  Can't miss the night show, and better to plan 2-day to here."
2216,4,15-Aug,N/A,Fun park to visit,"Very hot day visit in August. Games are OK but long line up for a game almost 1.5hrs  is not worth. Fastpass is not that 'fast' to play for the game, morning time get the fast pass and entry time indicated on 1900 to 2000........what a surprised. Shops and restaurants are OK. Overall, is a great place to visit, of course for kids."
2217,2,15-Aug,N/A,Fast pass disgace,"Have been to the real disney world and it was amazing, had the wrist bands, was able to book the fast passes via the disney app attached to my wrist band. At Tokyo disney you have to line up for a fast pass at the ride, doesn't that defeat the purpose. Also had to wait forever in every attraction i went to. The detail that was in the disney park in orlando isn't here either and the staff are no as bubbly. Wouldn't come here again until they upgrade their technology."
2218,3,15-Aug,United Kingdom,"Decent day out, better for kids probably ","Disneyland Tokyo was a fun day out, and cost only about ¬£35 each (same as Tokyo's robot restaurant), although be warned they don't accept foreign debit cards. As a theme park it's probably better for families with children, as there are only the or four thrill rides, each with massive queues (up to 3 hours). There is a FastPass queue avoider, but is you're in the park very early you'll struggle top get a decent time slot, and once you've got one FastPass you're not allowed another for a few hours. The long queues even apply to the food (the fast food restaurant we ate in was tremendously inefficient). One tip though: Splash Mountain (a log flume) has a 'single rider' queue, which allows individuals not wanting to sit with their friends to walk straight down the FastPass lane and avoid a 3 hour queue. The ride would not have been worth 3 hours waiting, so this was a great idea; shame they don't do it on any other rides. If you're looking for thrilling roller-coasters, this is probably not the park for you. If you're a Disney fan or have young children, I'm sure you'll have a lovely time. "
2219,5,15-Jul,Australia,Not an theme park goer,"Visited on a very hot evening in July with my adult daughter when we had an evening to fill before flying out.  I've never been or wanted to go to a theme park  like this before but it was a good experience.  Visiting after 6 pm meant much cheaper entrance fees and it didn't seem overly crowded.  There was still a 90 minute wait on most rides, too long for us, so we opted for attractions with less than 30 mins to wait.  Got to enjoy some fun rides in Toontown, the Grand Prix cars, carousel etc.  the night lights parade was exceptional.  And to top it off all the staff were unfailingly polite and happy.  Only downside would be the terrible food selection although the prices were very reasonable we thought. Easily accessed from Haneda international airport via subway then two trains."
2220,4,15-Jan,Australia,Family Fun - But Fast Pass info would have been helpful,"Queues for rides were long as expected, given population numbers in Japan, but generally after some hours we got on most things. Fast Pass can only be used on for a single ride at a time that may give you a quick queue entry time some two or three hours away so best to get into the park, find a ride that seems to have the most queues and book in that ride first while you queue to do something else. Also a park map in English would also have been of use!"
2221,5,15-Jan,Singapore,Fun fun experience.,Worth the visit. The ride was fun and well designed. Love the staff too. Friendly and cheerful. Definitely would go back again.
2222,4,15-Jul,United States,"Nice place but food is pretty bad, just a bit better that in US","All the rides are quite nice, and line were not horrible. It was a rainy day though. However food was not worth the money at all. Worth bringing your own food."
2223,5,15-Jun,Australia,Recommend you plan your visit,"This is the perspective of a 50  something year old woman.i visited with my 21year old son and 40 something Japanese friend..This was my third visit to Tokyo Disneyland.I went on Monday the 22nd of June,the second last day of the Easter (! in June) theming with beautiful decorations and a wonderful full scale Easter Parade as well as the Happiness is Here parade.I highly recommend pre-planning and looking up crowd predictions,opening hours,show times,temporary closures,attractions and restaurant options so that you can prioritise what you want to do and make the most of fastpasses.One day isn't enough to see everything!I really enjoy the parades and the shows.The Dreamlights Show in the evening is a standout with magical lit up floats.The night show with laser projections on the castle is spectacular.There is a lottery to win prime viewing spots with seating but in three visits I have had no luck winning seats.I highly recommend the shows too.I don't speak Japanese but I find the familiar songs sung in Japanese very endearing.One Man's Dream,the Magic Lives On is held in a large,covered area.Sometimes there is a lottery for some sessions.My second favourite is Minnie o Minnie,featuring...Minnie!!great costumes and music.The venue is not large and the tiered seating is uncovered but with some shade.I like the Enchanted Tiki Room and haven't had to wait long for this indoor show with an ""in the round"" seating pattern and featuring animatronic singing birds...and Stitch.I did not like the Country Bear show at all.Lyrics in English were quite black.There are special lunch and dinner shows but advance reservations are needed and on the website this can only be done in Japanese.If you have a Japanese speaking friend this could open up this opportunity.This visit I went to Horseshoe Roundup featuring Woody and a funny Japanese!  cowboy.It was a fun show and included lunch.I would like to go to a show featuring Mickey but they sell out early.My favourite ride is Splash Mountain.Even though we were a group of three,we used the single rider line which significantly shortened our wait.I also like Pirates of the Caribbean and It's a small world.Phantom Manor is excellent but has long queues.Pooh's Hunny Hunt is a top attraction and Fastpasses is good for this.Most people love it but it left me underwhelmed after 2 rides.Not enough visual interest for me.Star Tours has great graphics but is a bit jerky.The jungle cruise develops a long queue early so we headed there first.My lack of Japanese meant the commentary and jokes were completely lost on me but it was scenic.Tom Sawyer's island ( rafts or canoes) could be  left for a second visit,after you have seen other things.I have tried the Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall which has awesome theming.I also enjoyed the Blue Bayou,overlooking the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.We stayed three nights in the Disney area at a hotel with a shuttle to the parks.This made getting there an hour before opening possible (it is worthwhile) and made getting back to the hotel when we were exhausted easier than taking the train back to Tokyo and negotiating that looong walk from the Keiyo line at Tokyo station.We had back to back days at Tokyo Disney and Disneysea and it was tiring.We left at 6pm on the second day after our early starts."
2224,5,15-Apr,Singapore,Easter eggs!,"Never been to Disney in the states yet so In asia, Japan Disneysea is definitely awesome! They have merchandise exclusively for seasons! The spring season I been too, their theme was EASTER!! There are decoration of Disney friends in easter egg form! Super duper kawaii!"
2225,4,15-Jul,Japan,Protect your mobile and camera against water,"Disneyland has a special parade for summer season. During the parade, they spread water. A lot of people get wet to the skin. Take care of your mobile and camera."
2226,5,14-Sep,United States,5 Stars-Wish I had more time to spend,"This was a business sponsored trip and I only had 4 hours....so you get the point.Awesome rides, food were a little different compared to the parks in USA bot I got to try the turkey leg....5 stars....waiting to go again!We visited in April '14"
2227,4,14-Nov,Philippines,Good,"Good to see. Disbeyland is always busy but i cam see they are not children friendly. They pick kids up if they are out of the way, they are not smiling always too but overall we love it"
2228,4,15-Apr,Australia,Wow the crowds!,"We visited during March/ April, which we did not realise was school holidays. We even went on a weekday thinking that it may be a bit better, don't think it really helped.So crowded, 2.5-3 hour wait for most big rides. Make sure you get fast passes where ever you can, and early, most rides ran out of fast passes by midday.The people working and the people visiting are all so helpful and calm. No screaming children, which you would expect when you have to wait in a line for hours.The food is quite good. Some interesting things on the menu, what can you expect for being in Japan, but they had a good variety of western style food too.I did love visiting especially since I had been to other Disneylands in America so it was good to see how Japan did it.Would definitely recommend going there, just be patient if you go during peak time."

Spend your desired weekend among Cartoon Celebrities and Childhood friends. Recomended by Richieast - Luxury Lifestyle Blog in Asia and Middle East
2230,4,15-Jul,Australia,Hot in Summer but worth the visit,"The Tokyo Summer is almost unbearable! There needs to be more places to cool off in Disneyland. We went on Star Wars twice just to cool down. Very few misting machines. We bought an umbrella just to escape the harsh sun. Bring water bottles you can refill at the park and save some money. Bring your wallet too. Ate at the Alice in Wonderland Buffeteria, Food was average and small portions, still hungry, but the atmosphere was great and unique. Lots of walking, you will be exhausted. FastPass is a great idea. Choose your rides you want in order, as FastPass goes quickly and we didn't get to go on some rides. Left completely exhausted. Stay for the Night Parade, lots of lights and some fireworks, the Disney experience. Definitely worth the visit. Needs more places with shade or cooling off air con areas. Hot Hot Hot."
2231,5,15-Jul,Myanmar,Great visit,It was great visit on July 25 with lovely family.I think Tokyo Disneyland is better than Hong Kong Disneyland.But our visiting summer time is very hot about 35 degree C.
2232,5,15-Aug,N/A,BaBa,"Good information We love you so much for your email address Bye for now ƒ∑ to get to see if the charge for a couple, but it would like us know when the new York and a bit"
2233,5,15-Apr,Singapore,Try to avoid the peak seasons,"Try to avoid the school vacation periods of Japan (e.g. end March, start April) as the park will be extremely crowded. Wait times can reach 3 hours or more for favourites like Space Mountain, severely minimising your chances of sitting on more rides. So, do get your hands on the Fast Passes if you are able to! It'll help if you can get to the park early, 1-2 hours before opening hours to join the wait to enter. And as for parades, good viewing spots are often snapped up pretty quick by Japanese who camp with mats. What is very pleasant though, is that the Japanese are very orderly and polite when it comes to queueing so don't worry about it being messy during peak seasons."
2234,5,15-Jul,United Kingdom,It's Disney all the way ,"This is what everyone would recognise as Disneyland. It was a hot and very humid day, but the whole atmosphere was just one of fun fun fun.  There are sufficient air conditioned restaurants to cool down in.  A big plus was the fact that the commissary and catering was not as expensive as other Disney resorts.It did not seem too crowded even though there were a lot of people in the park as it was July.  My family and I used fast pass for the popular rides and picked others to queue the full course. The electrical parade was fantastic. Well now we have been to all five Disney resorts.  Orlando is a city in itself, but comparing just the prime sites in each city Tokyo Disneyland is clean, efficient and has exceptionally nice staff just like the two American and Hong Kong sites. Disneyland Paris on the other hand really needs to step up it's game compared to this wonderful place here in Tokyo. Hopefully Disney Shanghai will be as good when it opens in 2016!So in short if you like the Disney experience then you'll certainly get it at this resort, we spent over 12 hours here and had a wonderful time. Tomorrow it's Tokyo Disney Sea."
2235,4,15-Jun,N/A,2 days at disney,"We have visited,Paris,HK and now Tokyo we believe this is the better organize one ,still very busy even our visit was in weekday overall good rides and fun for the kids,VIP pass not friendly at all still need to wait 3-4 hours for the given time you can immagine you need to go back and forward to catch the right time..."
2236,5,15-Jul,Indonesia,If only it's done in English..,"It's just as fun as other Disney them parks, really, but I'd have enjoyed it waaayyyy better if English were used more.. Haha.."
2237,4,14-Aug,N/A,Had to visit the infirmary...,"Our first day we decided to visit tokyo disneyland.  only 20 minutes after stepping into the front entrance, I got really ill.  Dizzy, and nearly fainted.  My husband got someone to bring a wheelchair to me and wheeled me to the first aid area.  To my surprise, it was like a mini hospital.  Nurses on stand by ready to check me in.  I got a small area with a bed to rest and to hydrate.  I believe i had a minor heat stroke.  Anyway, they made sure not to give me wrong meds because I was still nursing.  Even with the language barrier, we were able to communicate.  Once I felt better, I went back to the hotel, then came back to disneyland for my kids sake.  note: Summer in Tokyo is very hot! be sure to hydrate.  Its also a good idea to come out after the sun has gone down.  It was actually nice visiting park after 6pm."
2238,4,15-Jul,Germany,My first Disneyland experience,"I visited other theme parks in Europe before and was very excited to go to my first Disney experience. The overall park experience was very nice: clean, organised and affordable. However the selection of rides was not ideal for me, I expected more 'adrenaline rides', while majority of the attractions were targeting kids and/or a calmer audience. Should probably have chosen Osaka Universal Studios for that...So if you are either visiting with small children, are a die-hard Disney fan or are into relaxing rides with beautifully crafted scenery...go here! All others: better check their website on details of the offered rides and compare with other them parks in Japan."
2239,5,15-Jul,N/A,Family eidmubarak@1436m,"We managed to spend from 10.00 to 15.00 at this amazing and adventerous theme park which was not enough, by the way we had been to paris disneyland last 2year; Attraction and facilities mostly the same but tokyo has more visitors mainly from mainland china. At some point was too crowded. Assessibility was great and easy."
2240,5,14-Aug,Iceland,"If you like Disney stuff and happen to be in Japan, you must go!","Very clean and fun! Spring is fun under warm sunshine and beautiful flowers. Summer is not so great as it will be really hot and there are not enough shades. Restaurants are packed with people. Fall is one of the best season, may be, specially during Halloween season. Christmas is another good time of the year as everything will be decorated and just wonderful. After the new year, it will be the slowest season, but you can enjoy the park with less crowd and absolutely more freedom on your schedule. Dress up well in winter!"
2241,4,15-Jul,Indonesia,Best Disneyland,"Park is not so crowded, waiting times is not so bad. Detail and ambience and cleanliness is very good. Staff also very friendly and accommodating. F&B price is reasonable, not so pricey.  Among other disney parks that we've visited, Tokyo Disneyland is surely the best."
2242,5,15-Jun,China,One of the best Disney parks in the world!,"Tokyo Disneyland is a must for all Disney fans. This is one of the most clean, orderly, and friendly Disney parks my husband and I have visited (and we've visited all but Hong Kong Disneyland).Advice on getting there:1. There is a bus that runs from the Narita Airport (The Friendly Limousine) that takes you directly to the many hotels of Tokyo Disney Resort and the parks as well. Check departure times on the Tokyo Disneyland website. Pay for a ticket before leaving the Narita airport at the kiosk inside and then go to the bus stop the workers direct you to. I believe it was about $25 each for my husband and I and it was worth the money. It takes about 30-45 minutes to get from Narita to the park. I believe the last bus runs in around 5:10 ish, so try to arrive at the airport around 3-4PM to use this service.2. Don't let the language barrier deter you from experiencing Tokyo Disneyland. While not everyone spoke English, all of the workers did their best to help us or to direct us to where we could get help. My husband and I learned some Japanese before we went, but it was really their willingness to work with us that made everything work. We appreciated their unwavering kindness throughout our trip.3. Choose June over July. My husband and I can only travel in summer as we are educators. We visited this park in June and found we were able to get on any ride we wanted, multiple times, and the weather had some nice breaks in the heat due to rain. The rain also seemed to clear out the park just a bit, which meant more rides for us. 4. Stay at a Disney Hotel. You get perks such as park hopping every day if you choose to buy your tickets from the hotel and every guest gets the Magic 15 pass. This pass allows you to enter the park 15 minutes early in a separate line from the rest of the visitors. This actually makes a huge difference as it takes you less time to get in and you can get to rides before the crowds do. Guests of the Disney Hotels also get to ride the Monorail for free.  Highlights of this Disney Park:1. Monsters Hide and Go Seek - On this ride guests are given flashlights with which to seek out Monsters hidden throughout the various rooms. This is interactive and makes for a different experience each time you ride! This is an original ride at Tokyo Disneyland and can't be found anywhere else in the world.2. Pooh's Hunny Hunt - This is also a Tokyo Disneyland original. The ride is different every time you experience it due to the trackless technology used in the cars. My husband and I loved this!3. Themed Food! - Tokyo loves their themes and Disney loves themes the most. There are Mickey shaped churros, Little Green Alien buns, and so much more. Make sure you try all of the unique flavors of popcorn such as curry and soysauce!4. Pictures! - Everyone seemed to be mindful of other people's pictures during our visit. People would take turns at picture points and not crowd those taking pictures. The staff worked really hard with us to ensure no other guests were in our pictures, the results are some great pictures that make you look like you're alone in the park!There is only one con to this entire park: If you're a vegetarian you will will  starve while simultaneously gaining a lot of weight. They offer very, very little in the way of actual vegetarian food. Even if something is labeled something that sounds like it's vegetarian, such as: ""vegetable curry,"" it has meat in it. When in doubt, ask, and we did, and every single time there was meat in the dish. We were directed to one restaurant every time we asked about food and it was the Eastside Cafe. There they give vegetarians one option, and that option is pasta. It was fine, but the restaurant was one of the least themed and exciting in the entire park, so it was a bit of a let down. We tried eating at Blue Bayou as this is an anniversary tradition of ours, but they were unable to find any dish we could eat there. Unlike Disneyland in Anaheim, Disney World in Florida, and even Disneyland Paris, most restaurants do not offer a vegetarian option and they are unable/unwilling to stray from the given menu. The cast were always very kind to us and continually directed us to the ONE vegetarian dish in the park, but they were unable to provide a vegetarian option in pretty much all restaurants/quick service restaurants. Vegetarians can eat sweets. There is a waffle house which is absolutely delicious. There is popcorn all over the park and irresistible mickey churros. There's a bakery in the World Bazaar and has multi-flavored breads and sweets around every corner. Vegetarians can eat, but they'll be starved for any real sustenance. My advice for vegetarians is to plan meals at Tokyo Disney Sea. That's what my and husband and I did. They don't have many more options, but they at least have some.Despite the lack of options for vegetarians, my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this park and will return as soon as, and as often as, we can."
2243,4,15-Mar,Philippines,Great for Pictures But Don't Expect to Ride Everything in 1 Day,"Getting there is easy, trains are efficient enough to do that.The problem was it's too crowded that at 10am, even if you get a pass, you would have to wait until 7pm to get the ride. The queues are that long. I'm not sure if it had been a school holiday when we went there (March 17, 2015) but after one ride, that was it.Here's the rest of the blog: The Japan Expedition 3: Tokyo Disney Resort http://wp.me/p2uAw5-Bm"
2244,5,15-Jun,South Korea,The best Disneyland out of all. seriously!,"Because we love going to Disneyland with my kids, we went to California, Hongkong and Tokyo. Out of three disneyland, It was a best! (Except it was all localized in Japanese) The rides are funner than anywhere else, the decoration of whole park, the services, so clean, new like looking and it was real ideal disneyland. I remember one of my japanese friend used to tell me that Japan disneyland is the best. I know what she meant. all of us four had amazingly great time whole day long. Just be aware that  a lot of ppl will be there so, try to go on week days and rainy days. that is the day we went, (not stormy rain but small rain) and we enjoyed with proper amounts of ppl. Suggestion,Get on 1. Pooh, 2. Monster Inc, 3. Star wars Eat 1. Mickey mouse sandwich, 2. mickey churos, and icecream."
2245,5,15-Jul,Taiwan,"""What a Trip""","Should say first, if you are planing to visit Tokyo Disneyland, keep a minimum of three days only for this,,,,, week day or weekend you will see 1000nds of fun loving people piling up. If you are traveling with kids you want make more than 6 to 7 attractions a day minus meal times, resting and shopping.This is one of the well organized and operated Theme parks and worth the penny you spend here,,,,Minimum height is 102cm for entering all the attractions around. So this is more a good thing for families with young kids...beautiful and relaxing all around and very entertaining and friendly staff, but English is below everage,,,,"
2246,5,15-Jul,Belgium,Awesome =D,"Have been to Disneyland in the USA, but this top it hands down! The Japanese people dig it so much =D Its hard not to enjoy it and enjoy the moment =D Big thumbs up to Tokyo Disney =D"
2247,3,15-May,Japan,Yes its Disneyland but it doesn't feel like one.,We took my daughter to Disneysea and this one for here 6th Birrhday i have to say i was very disappointed in both.After going to the one in Hong Kong you carnt compare the two. Hong Kong is miles better.  For before we even left home i was trying to organize things there and it eas very hard. Not much on there website was in English which made planning very hard.For photos with the Characters there were only a couple of place to have your photos taken. All the photos they took were really bad rushed and no care taken at all which i a big shame. The other problem was most of the Characters were walking around and you literally had to push and fight your way to get a photo because if you were polite you were just pushed away. I am talking about Adults pushing past 6 & 8 year old girls. Very poor. Because of all the pushing it made it really hard to get ant decent photos at all.The merchandise for sale was also sub standard i wanted to buy my daughter a beautiful keepsake but there was nothing to buy her.To my daughter it was still disneyland but both my husband and i were very disappointed.
2248,5,14-Aug,N/A,1st disney ever visited,"Will never forget the day we decided to go there, I was with my friends from work. As a child I had simple dreams, one of which is to go there. very crowded but dont mind, weather was fine. Wrong date mentioned here though as my visit was around 2004"
2249,5,15-Jul,N/A,Great family holiday,"What can you say about disney except that it is the happiest place on earth. Even though it was raining the entire day we were there but we still have a great time. Just come prepare with a rain coat or umbrella. And learn from the local, a light rain will not hold them from having fun.Restaurant option is like other disney park. I loved the flavour popcorn they have in different area of the park. Also loved the parade and all the shows"
2250,5,15-Jul,Australia,Perfect Day,Even though this obviously isn't the original park it is my favourite. The grounds of Disneyland Tokyo are immaculate. Dining option are a strange mix of Japanese/Disney themed cuisine which is fun. The rides are like no others in any other park especially the Winnie the Poo ride. So easy to get to from central Tokyo.
2251,5,15-Jul,Japan,We all enjoyed it very much (from my 3 year old daughter to my 58 year old aunt),"We went to Tokyo Disneyland last July 12 (Sunday). I was anticipating that we will have to wait about 2 hours (due to long queue) but that wasn't the case. There are many people as you can see from the photos but eventhough the lines are long we waited max of 20 minutes? We arrived at around 10:00am then left at 9 pm. We would have been able to go to other attractions but by maybe 6pm we just sat and waited for the Electrical Parade and the Once Upon a Time attraction infront of Cinderella's Castle. My daughter who just celebrated her 3rd Birthday had sooo muchhhh fun. The following day we went to Tokyo Disney Sea but she didn't enjoyed it that much maybe because there are not that much Disney characters only Pinocchio, Chipmunks, etc. No Mickey and Minnie, Donald and Daisy Duck, Disney princesses (which she knows). I think Disneyland is more for kids and kids at heart.  My husband who is quite impatient with the long lines and waiting and he is also sick didn't complain here. I don't know if because the lines are tolerable or maybe because he saw that our daughter was having fun. Even my aunt who is 58 already had a great time."
2252,4,14-Dec,United Kingdom,All the class you would expect from Disneyland,Excellent park with classic attractions that are no longer in the US parks.  fantastic public transport access from Tokyo and surrounds.  Only downside is how busy this park gets... Wow there are a lot of people.  Plan your route and pick the quietest day possible.
2253,5,15-May,France,A place to go!,"Been a long while since my last Disneyland excursion, and this one wasn't let me down. Entering directly from the train station and you will meet the Park. Arrived late afternoon and spend every seconds wondering around. The show at the castle is around 20:00, It was fun reminding you all the animation you've been wash since you were young. Great vibe of happy people around,so this will make a happy day for you!"
2254,5,15-Mar,United States,Disney done Japanese style,"Just like the one in Anaheim, only better! Everything looks the same, but instead of rude, boisterous pushy crowds, you're surrounded by polite, well-behaved people who sit when and where they're supposed to, and don't try to push their way in front of you. Be sure to check out all the different popcorn flavors and contains spread throughout the park!!"
2255,5,14-Dec,Japan,Time at Tokyo Disney,Wow I had a great time there. I went with a Friend and she really like it also. The wait in lines are much longer than in America but it just gives you time to enjoy being in the park!!Many Photo Opportunities !!I cant wait to come back here !!!
2256,4,15-May,United States,Tokyo Disney,I was very surprised how much this was like Disney World in Florida.  I guess I was hoping for it to be more in the Japanese style.  It was nice but very crowded.  We couldn't even get fast passes because they were sold out.
2257,5,14-Nov,N/A,Bisnis & Travelling,"I very excited with these place & impressed with staff performance. and the most important is these place very interested, because there are to many location of entertainment & carnaval parade. please visit these location & finding  an exciting experiences. please set up your available timing for one day. enjoy & happiness."
2258,5,15-Jul,Australia,One day is not enough!,"We decided to spend one day at Disneyland and 2 at Disneysea, but one day was not enough. We pre-booked our tickets online and printed them out at home which was very convenient and meant you went straight through the gate. Before you get to the gate go to the welcome centre for an English map and list of parades times.The park was busy the day we went, but I wouldn't say extreme, with the longest queue time being 90 mins for Splash Mountain and this didn't change all day. Therefore we recommend you get a fast pass for this first thing, as they sell out early.  We did get on it about 9:30pm and it was full of surprises!Other good rides were Space Mountain (we got on this twice with 2 fast passes, otherwise about 45 min queue, very fast roller coaster in the dark), Star Tours ( based on Star Wars and was a surprise at how good it was as the queue was only about 5 mins, boys went on twice and had different scene both times), Its a small world (a must for everyone), Pirates of the Caribean (only 5 min wait so went on twice, has Captain Jack Sparrow, some English), Pooh's Hunny Pot (this is Pooh's spelling, very cute and new style of ride which is quite different, long queue all day so try to get a fast pass), Big Thunder Railroad (roller coaster, but quite a long ride, try to get a fast pass as long queue in the sun), Jungle Cruise (great surprise, queue was only about 20 mins, boat driver spoke Japanese so fast and even though we couldn't understand a word, she was hilarious), Haunted Mansion (not scary, but well done and queue not too long). These are what we were able to ride in one day which we thought was pretty good. There were lots of others we didn't do or were too young for our teenage kids.We decided to get to the park at 10 am and stay late in order to avoid the Tokyo peak hour train after experiencing this in Osaka and not enjoying it at all.  We still had 12 hours at the park, which is enough for your feet for one day and avoided the queues to get in.  We think this is the way to go! If you can spread this out over 2 days and it is not peak time or a weekend, then you should get through everything. We of course skipped all the shows as they were all in Japanese which saved time for other things.We had a nice Italian sit down lunch near the entrance to the park called Eastside Cafe.   You could choose a 2 or 3 course meal including free drink refills with great service. Price was very reasonable by Australian standards. For dinner had the curry at The Bear Restaurant and it was not good at all.  Best to avoid this one.We did miss the 4 pm character show, which was a shame as the electric parade we wanted to see was cancelled due to high winds just before it was due to start.  The show projected onto the Disney castle at about 8:30 was fantastic. You can go into the lottery to get a seat right in front of the show and we recommend you do this so you have the best view and can rest your tired feet. How to do this is on the English program mentioned earlier.Overall we all had a wonderful experience for first time Disney goers for me and the boys.  Obviously most of the rides had Japanese language spoken, but this was not a real negative as you still could imagine what was going on. The park was so clean and pristine."
2259,5,15-Jul,United Kingdom,Much better the D Sea,"Who in there right mind puts Sea above Land. Yes there may be 'unique' attractions/rides but it doesn't matter it better. Why do I put DL above DS??Firstly its less busy Secondly it's less spread out Thirdly the established attractions, albeit, found in other parks are more exciting The queues for rides, concessions are shorter The night parade is better Of course the above is only my and my children's opinion. "
2260,5,15-Jul,Australia,Where dreams do come true,"Great overall experience, even for a retired couple.We visited Disneyland on a day pass that was booked in advance of our visit. Arrived around 9:30am, and visited all the different ""lands"" and went on a few of the rides and attractions as well. Without doubt, the ""splash Mountain"" ride was the best. Known as flume rides elsewhere, this ride has some truly amazing animated features throughout the caverns that you glide through, before the final splashdown. These features really make this the must do ride of the park, and explains why the wait time on this ride stretched out to 90 minutes at around 1pm. The other standout thing at this park is the cleanliness and ""freshness"" of the whole park, highlighted by the immaculate gardening as well; the colourful flower plantings and topiary are amazing, and the grassed areas would be the envy of a golf course green keeper!There are plenty of shops in which to browse and purchase, plenty of various food outlets, and rest rooms are never far away."
2261,5,15-May,United States,Excellent Spot for Kids 4-12,Had an awesome time with my little guy. We watched a couple of shows and rode the majority of the rides. He had a blast at 4 y/o as did I at 37. Lol!
2262,5,15-Jun,Philippines,There's no place like Disneyland,liked: souvenirs are fantastic especially the popcorn tumblersdisliked: nothing really. but i like them most about Disney :)
2263,4,15-Jul,Singapore,Must Read - Debit/Credit card users watch out,"We had a great time today at the park. The shows was excellent.However there's a little problem which I got very annoyed and frustrated right from the gate until the end of the day.It's my Debit/Master Credit card. We're from Australia which most bank nowadays offer a Debit card which can also be used as a credit card (Visa/Master). However because of the old fashion ""Debit"" card which cannot be used as a Credit card. We had problem right at the ticket box. The staff processed my card which was ""approved"", but she then realised that there's a word ""Debit"" card written in the front. She then advised I cannot pay by this card (even though the transaction has gone through). I showed her the transaction detail which was charged via my online banking and her receipts also said ""approved"". She made a big thing out of it regardless my explanation that's the card can be used as a credit card even thought it has the word ""Debit"" on it. She then called her supervisor and asked me to speak to him because she could not speak any English at all. Again I explained but  he didn't seem to be convinced. From my poorly understanding is that they cannot do a refund to a Debit card if requested by customers. Anyway, he told me that he will accept my card for this time only????  (I guessed they can't do a refund ;) And advised that I cannot used the card inside the park.Unfortunately this was the only card we had and we didn't bring a lot of Yens with us as we did not have any problems using this card for the past 10 days. Since we wanted to buy a few things for our Daughter so my Wife just try her luck. My Wife bought a few dresses (around 50,000 Yens) using the same card. The transaction gone through (I guessed they didn't spot the Word Debit on my card). So my Wife kept shopping using the same card which some counters refused to accept but some didn't care???? Some counters refused first but then we showed the receipts from other counters, they then accepted???It was my turn got refused when I tried to buy a few things on our way out. I totally lost it requested to speak to their Manager or whoever in charged that can speak English. A man came to see me, he seems to be a supervisor or higher whose can speak very good English. I then explained the whole thing again which he understood. He then called up the office and explained to his Boss which they will inform their staffs (he told me this will take some time to pass them around). I did buy a few more things but got too tired to all the explanations which I paid cash.  We're going to Disneysea tomorrow and hopefully I don't have to go through these hassles again. "
2264,5,15-Jun,Vietnam,Amazing,"I visited Tokyo Disneyland a month ago with my sister and had a lot of fun. There were lots of people so we had to overcome the crowds to enjoy the park to the most. We tried: Star Tours, Haunted Mansion,... I absolutely love the Japanese foods. They were delicious."
2265,3,15-Mar,N/A,Fun day,Very long lines and we had bad weather. But overall a fun day. Disney Sea was better but I would still recommend it!
2266,5,15-Apr,Thailand,Packed with people and fun!,"I know, I know....went on the last weekend of japanese school holidays and right in the Sakura season. So, of course, lots of people and long lines...nevertheless, we had a plan: get as many as fastpasses you can first (they run out early)  and go on single line rides (no lines). We managed to overcome the crowds and enjoyed the park to the most. All tired at the end but super happy. Have to do it again (but not on school holidays). A local lady told me a lot of young people in Tokyo have Disney annual passes and use it like their local playground, thus the crowds. In sum, a magical place and an attraction not to be missed by young or old."
2267,5,15-Jun,N/A,Loved it!,"Must do: Star Tours, Haunted Mansion, electric dream light show in the evening was something different and worth sticking around for, pizzas for lunch was nice and must have the popcorn (310 yen for regular size) as they are just so moorish. Disney shops were expensive but worth getting a souvenir. Waiting lines were 40-45 mins (we went at end of June so while it was crowded it wasn't stifingly so). You can use a Fast Pass which can reduce waiting time to 0-10 mins, but you can only get a Fast Pass every 1.5 hrs and you are allocated a time that you can enter the ride (usually in 2-3 hrs time). There was so much to explore and we stayed for 10 hrs there - we certainly felt like we saw everything. PS: bring a raincoat if going in June|early July."
2268,5,15-May,Australia,Such a fun couple of days - make sure you use the Fastpass!,"We visited Tokyo Disneyland in May for two days and had so much fun! We went on a Monday and Tuesday in May, and the crowds were considered 'light' but it still looked very busy to me! To be honest, we didn't have a problem with lines, we just went on rides with shorter queues (train ride, teacup, Inspector Gadget roller coaster, paddle steamer, Dumbo ride etc). Our young kids were happy to wait too (which surprised me!) because there were so many fun and interesting things to look at, even while lining up. On the second day, we made sure we used the fast passes which are absolutely worth it - it allows you to to straight to the front of the line at a given time (we used it for Splash mountain and Pooh's Hunny hunt and avoided 60-90 min wait).We also found that Toon Town was much quieter in the late afternoon/evening so our kids were able to easily go on rides/see all the character houses without having to line up.There are a ton of food options in the park, although as a vegetarian, I found it difficult to find something substantial to eat. The kids each got a refillable popcorn bucket, which is a fantastic souvenir and the kids loved trying the different popcorn flavours. I would definitely recommend visiting Tokyo Disneyland, you can easily spend a couple of days at the park... there is so much to see and do!"
2269,4,15-Jun,Australia,Where dreams come true,"Well this was my first Disneyland so I was very excited! Unfortunately I don't speak Japanese so some of it was lost on me. Go to whatever ride you really want to go on and get a fast pass straight up. We got there at 10:30 and our first past pass was for 8pm! The lines without a fast pass are huge! So you won't be able to see everything! Splash mountain was my favourite ride. Space mountain was pitch black the whole time as you get whipped around (my boyfriend's favourite). The buzz light year astroblasters was great fun! If you line up to see mickey you are only allowed to be in one photo! The fireworks were awesome and the light show projected onto the castle was awesome. Also you can go in the castle, it is not just hollow like I have heard about other disneylands."
2270,5,15-Jul,Australia,Pirates outstanding,"Great fun day, very helpful staff who spoke English, best fun rides Thunder Mountain and Star Wars but outstanding robots and animation in the Pirates of the Carribean my favourite ride of the day"
2271,4,15-Jul,Indonesia,IT's a DISNEYLAND and it's in Tokyo,"Crowded and queuing up is a tagline for places like this. No attraction that has no line up there.  It's good they have a fast lane machine to register before the time, so one can go somewhere else to see before it's time stamped.  But I would say it's rather useless considering, one cannot register two attractions within the same interval time simultaneously."
2272,4,15-Jun,Singapore,Third time and it's still a great visit!,"This is the 3rd time that my 2 daughters (13 & 16), my wife and I have visited the Tokyo Disneyland. We bought the 2 days tickets online so we didn't need to queue at the ticketing booth. It was great that some of the rides we missed the last visit are open so we had a great time. My younger daughter's a Star Wars fan and she was able to seat the ride 4-5 times to see the 3 possible endings. (hint: To see different endings, join different queue. We also managed to catch the night time electric dreams parade which was amazing."
2273,5,15-Jul,Indonesia,Crowded but worth it,"It's still very crowded in Monday. My must list are Monster Inc, Buzz Lightyear, and star tour. And two parades - the one in the afternoon around 2 pm and electrical parade at night. "
2274,5,15-Jun,Sweden,Best parades!,"The parades here are longer and better than on the other parks we visited. And the people sit down when watching them! No cutting lines like in Paris and USA. Also, the park is very clean and characters are easy to meet"
2275,5,15-Jul,Singapore,DEFINITELY THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH. ,"Having visited all the other Disneyland's around the world I would have to say this was my third favourite. Two parks consisting of the main and sea Disney they both stack up to expectations. Disney Sea was my favourite. Great rides, fantastic scenery and well organised. The crowds during the weekday were tolerable. The rides including the 3D rides are pretty impressive. Just a positive experience for the kids and adults. "
2276,4,15-Jun,United States,DISNEY IS ALWAYS MAGICAL. ,We love Disney and visit the park anywhere they offer it. This was my second time to Tokyo Disney resort and it was as amazing as my first visit here.  Space Mountain was under renovations again and it was wet again (June 2009 & June 2015) but everything else was open.  The lines were decent (70 minutes was the longest wait) and we used the fastpass for those attractions.  The only thing that we missed out on we're the shows. They were all in Japanese.  
2277,5,15-Jun,China,Better than expected!,"I read a lot of reviews about being so crowded, I thought twice going there I was afraid.  I just got lucky then. I checked first in a crowd calendar available online and the days I chose were perfect. Arrived there before they opened ( bf 9am) that was very useful I grabbed a fastpast and did three attractions in one hour. Most of the attractions were 5-10 minutes queue. Except for splash mountain and big thunder mountain that were 50 mins tops. But with fast past no problem. It is the same as magic kingdom in Orlando. Clean and organized. They cancel the fireworks a lot because of the wind, it is next to the ocean so... I went on a Tuesday so try to go on a weekday if u can. It was just perfect as every time I've been in a Disney park. Loved it."
2278,4,14-Sep,Australia,Same same,Basically pretty much the same as the other Disneyland parks but in japanese. Was good fun and lines were probably a bit less - possibly time of year we went. It is a fair way from central tokyo so staying at the local hotels is a good option
2279,5,15-Jun,N/A,MrAng,To all everyone who work with Disneyland Tokyo. You guys are amazing. Your gorgeous smile and excitement never fail. I had a good time there. There is a few people I would like to highlight but I can't read Japanese. She work in lilo and stitch theme house. I was accidently drop my curry pop corn. She clean up immediately and ask one of her colleague to get a new one for me. I am impressed to her action and sincerity. That is true authentic hospitality. I was there on the 30 of june I hope this message can gain credit to her. Once again Thank you so much Disneyland Tokyo my childhood dream come true !
2280,5,15-Apr,Australia,Fun Fun Fun,Such a wonderful theme park - A real highlight is the Monsters Inc ride. The staff were wonderful too!
2281,5,15-Apr,United Kingdom,Had a great time,"i'm 25 this year and i've been there for few times whenever i visit japan. the one thing i like about it is that they either make a new attraction at times, or they upgrade the attractions! which is wonderful, so as a repeater, i dont get bored going to the same rides / attractions. the foods are nothing special despite its a bit pricey, but they have a wide variety of popcorn with unique flavours and with a special container (bit pricey, but worth it if you want to try few unique flavours like strawberry or curry flavoured popcorns). i guess this is a must go place for all tourist who visits japan, especially if you are a disney lover."
2282,4,15-May,Canada,Excellent for kids and family,"My friend and I went there in the early morning but it became crowded even before we got off the train. Every attraction had a big lineup that we spent most of our time waiting. The rides are awesome, but everything was explained in Japanese. I would recommend this place for families with kids."
2283,5,15-Jan,Indonesia,Magical!,"Since i got no disneyland in my country, i was very excited to visit this park. If you're a disney fan like me, this place is heaven. I love how visitors wear disney accessories, despite their ages (saw a grandpa wore a disney characters hat and it was cute!)The staffs were super nice, even though sometimes its hard to talk with them because not all of the staffs or crews speak english fluently.I definitely will visit this park over and over again!"
2284,5,15-Jun,Indonesia,Best Disneyland in Asia,"Our visit to Tokyo Disneyland was a joyfull experience. Easy access by train; variety of attractions, shops, cafes, etc; its friendly & helpfull staffs are just few to mention. We're really having a great time there."
2285,5,15-Jun,N/A,Disneyland experience,"It is colorful, cheerful and 'flower full' with many many princess like kids. It is a dreamland for me"
2286,5,15-Apr,N/A,A must-visit place when you go to Tokyo!,"Even with the huge crowds, the park is well managed and offers lots of attractions for people of all ages.Truly a magical place and I want to go back again!"
2287,5,15-May,Australia,Fun place,What a fun place enjoyed it so much go on a Sunday and you see everyone dressed up in costumes the electric parade was awesome
2288,5,15-May,Japan,Amazing experience for children and adults alike,"We got to experience this in May.  They say that in Japan, the rainy season is May-Aug, but we lucked out this day.  We had a little drizzle (just enough to keep the huge masses away), but it subsided around noon.  Absolutely incredible experience...our favorite was the log ride attraction--for the visual experience riding through the caves.  But the highlight was the lights parade at evening time.  Only wished we had enough time to go to Disney Sea...next time!"
2289,2,15-Jun,Spain,Watered Down ,"First let me say I'm a Disney fan. The original Disneyland opened the year I was born. My first big trip when I was little was to Disneyland and I have fond memories of taking my own kids to both U.S. parks.Visiting Tokyo Disney was on my bucket list.I stayed at The a Tokyo Nikko near the park. Disney runs s free shuttle from this hotel. However it leaves at 8:30am and returns at 9:00pm so you have to spend over 12 hours in the park.The bus ran 20 minutes late in both directions. The paperwork used was old fashioned sheets of papers and clipboards. Lots of delays in using this out dated system. The video on the bus was only in Japanese. Half of our bus was English speaking so all the pricing and other information was missed.The ticket lines were long and moved very, very slow. A one day adult ticket ran $56.00, which is cheaper than the U.S. Parks.The crowds in the park swelled as the day went on. In the afternoon the park started to feel overcrowded and uncomfortable. Several attractions were closed and the firework show was cancelled. A couple fast pass areas were closed as well. The food was horrific. Even in the U.S. Disney isn't known for good food, but this was awful. Lots of popcorn wagons, but the popcorn was simply gross - I threw mine away! I also threw a hamburger away that was really foul tasting. I got a table at the Blue Bayou and sat down for 20 minutes without any acknowledgement. I got up and walked out! I tried for chicken at The Queen of Hearts. The picture looked good, a juicy chicken breast, but in reality I was handed a plate with a bone and a bunch of pieces. I didn't accept the plate and left again! Finally I ate at the buffet at the Crystal Palace. It's an odd buffet, the food is mediocre, but it's the best I could find in the park! I find it odd there is nothing Japanese about this park. It's all just a recreation of the U.S. parks. There is nothing unique or special for Japan. Everything seems much smaller, more cheaply made and watered down. It has the popular rides, but a lot of special things are missing. It just seems like a medium level amusement park. It felt lackluster. The shows, parades and shops seemed less impressive and unique. It's just a very poor copy of itself!The Japanese love it! They go all out to dress the part. They lay out mats and blankets two hours prior to a parade to get a good spot and they totally get into it.To me, it's just a water down version of a Disney park and the magic just wasn't at this park. It's now off my bucket list and I don't feel a need to return."
2290,5,14-Oct,United States,Disney Magic and excellent people-watching!,"The lines for the rides are incredibly long, and most of the fast passes are gone if you get to the park anytime after 10 a.m. -- yes, this is all true. The beauty of Tokyo Disneyland is that you don't actually need to ride all of the rides to have a wonderful experience and truly get a taste of that Disney Magic. My friend and I had just as much fun walking around to all of the different snack stands, shopping in the amazing gift shops, and looking at all of the people in the park who had dressed up as their favorite characters for the day.For those who love the rides, all of your old favorites are here: Space Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, you name it. The rides are all voiced/dubbed in Japanese (I'm not sure why anyone would go into this expecting otherwise? The park is in Japan.) The parades are gorgeous, and just like at Disneyland and Disney World in the U.S., there are tons of characters walking around and interacting with the crowd. The food is a mix of Japanese and American-themed, and my friend and I both loved the Mickey Mouse-shaped steamed buns! They were really tasty, as was the flavored popcorn you can get at stands throughout the park. The gift shops, as I mentioned, are out of this world -- I was blown away at the sheer amount of apparel, themed snacks, candies, and memorabilia. (I work in the toy industry, so I appreciate when merchandising is done really well, and this is an aspect of Japanese culture I find absolutely fascinating. Everything is so beautifully displayed and packaged!) We didn't make it to any of the shows, but I imagine they were top notch. Overall, we had a blast, so don't let the lines scare you away. You'll have a wonderful time regardless of how many rides you make it on!"
2291,5,15-Jun,N/A,Thumbs up,Had an awesome time with my 1 year old. He loved every moment of it. They have a nursery that is so nice and clean. All the workers were so nice. Rides had a little wait but he was allowed to sit on our lap for some of them. Would definitely recommend it
2292,5,15-Jun,Sri Lanka,A real fun time for the whole family!!,"Although it is crowded, long queues and the language in almost all attractions is Japanese, this is a great place to be! Do not miss!! The staff is very helpful and almost anywhere you look around you can have a friendly staff member who can manage English to help you out. The Parades are a must watch and takes you to a Fairy land full of happiness!!The Western River Railroad, Star Tours, Its a Small World, Mark Twain river Boat  and Snow White are some of the attractions we enjoyed most although one day is not at all enough to go to all the attractions one has in mind."
2293,5,15-Jun,Australia,Disney Magic is always worth a visit,"We stayed for two days and spent from 12pm-9:30pm here both Days! There are rides for everyone from our 2 year old, 5 year old and 15 year old. There are quite a lot more family orientated rides and ""cruises"" which were great we could all go together. The queue for most rides was between 5-15min. Some rides we had totally to ourselves and others we were on before the 5 min. There were bigger rides with longer wait times but we just took a fast pass and came back later. The food was very limited in terms of a western selection. We are pretty picky with food! We ate at the east side cafe the pasta was very nice. I wish the menu was a bit more in depth in English though. There are no ATMS for withdrawal from international cards which I found really odd! Everything is very well organized and lots of fun."
2294,4,14-Dec,Singapore,Fun times for the family,"Spent the whole day with the family. Fun for the family as the rides are mostly for all ages. Food was delightful especially recommend the varieties of popcorns they have such as soy sauce, curry, caramel, strawberry and many others. The alien mochi was so cute! Only downside is the time to queue which took us about two hours on average per ride. Try to get the express pass if you can especially for popular rides. Would not be a problem if you go during non-peak period. "
2295,5,15-Jun,Australia,Wonderful day!!,"Well we spent 11 hours here so no need to say we had a fantastic time.  The only negative would be the fast pass.  In other parks like Universal Studios that I have visited you can pay extra for the fast pass but here you just go to a machine, was a bit crap really because we used our first pass at 11am and the earliest we could use it was 6.30pm which of course was much later than just waiting in line.  If they had paid fast passes I'm sure the line lengths would not be anywhere near as long.  We did have an awesome day tho, Splash Mountain was a highlight, very fun ride despite waiting 80 minutes to ride it was worth it.  Plenty of food outlets that relate to all tastes.  Easy to get around, maybe some more water/drink outlets would be handy.  In saying that a lot of the rides had water fountains which was great when waiting in a long line.  Can't wait to go back!!"
2296,5,14-Aug,India,Most beautiful memories,"Going to Disneyland is a dream come true, we enjoyed our visit thoroughly.Must visit place for anyone going to Tokyo. "
2297,4,15-Jun,Australia,Great for kids,"I enjoyed the day at Disneyland and we easily stayed until 10pm. The rides aren't very exciting, definitely not the highlight of the park.I enjoyed the vibe,  lots of people sporting ears and outfits, everything in theme. Massive amounts of effort going into all the attractions, detailed and fun.I was surprised that my favorite ride was the small world,  in no way exhilarating but definitely worth a look.Would not recommend lining up for star tours, not worth the wait, or the monster ride. I would recommend waiting until later in the evening when the wait times are short if you want to go on them.Prices for food,  drink and souvenirs very decent for a theme park and some healthy options for food which is nice.The monsters Inc melon bakery treat was also a highlight for me. "
2298,5,15-Jun,Malaysia,Great experience!!,"You may buy ticket online in advance instead of queue-up at the entrance, it will waste your time. It is fun for most of the games but normally need to queue-up for sometimes. Got show & fireworks in the evening in front of the castle."
2299,5,15-Jun,United States,Fun with Japanese Charm!,"Even though this Disney park is smaller than the U.S. Parks we had fun. Tickets seemed cheaper and for June not so crowded. So if you happen to be in Japan spending one day here is still fun. :-)Enjoy,ExploreTraveler"
2300,5,15-Jun,Romania,A treat for your child - or inner child :),"A day spent in Disneyland is something we all need at least once - whether we do it for our kids or our inner child. After visiting Disneyland Paris a few years ago, it was nice to go to Tokyo and see old and new attractions alike. We went on a Tuesday, but it was still rather crowded (i.e. waiting time for some more popular attractions was close to an hour after lunch). I guess the best part about going - regardless of the rides you take or attractions you visit - is the instant cheer that gets a hold of you a few minutes after entering and only fades out the next day. The fireworks and lights show at the end of the day were brilliant, and so were the parades. As most of the visitors left as soon as they were over, we were able to take maybe 3 rides in about half an hour - one of which started just a few minutes before they closed, and still let us take the ride. Plenty of places to eat and enjoy dessert, with very helpful and cheerful staff ready to assist at any time. I would definitely recommend a visit there if you go toTokyo."
2301,5,15-Jan,Australia,Loved It!!,"Eleven family members aged between 1 and 65 traveled to Tokyo in Jan 2015.  We were expecting crowds but were pleasantly surprised on the weekdays we went - it was nowhere near as bad as we expected.  We did venture back in on a weekend just to experience the craziness - if you don't like crowds I would definitely avoid the weekend at all costs.The character meet and greet process is fair superior than the set up in the US.  Although it is completely unpredictable, it is great that the characters are just wandering around the park at various locations at random times. You never know who you will meet and get the chance to have a photo with.  And everyone was so orderly and courteous when queuing for photos too.If you're not a huge parade fan, take the opportunity to go on the super popular rides when the parades are on - the queues are much smaller when everyone is watching the parade.I would recommend planning your trip and ensure that you utilise your fast passes appropriately.  We always grabbed a fast pass for everyone in the group - even if some people did not want to go on the ride.  This meant that the some people could go on the same ride back-to-back within the one fast pass period.If you are a Disney pin collector you may be a little disappointed - we could not find a single pin in the park to buy that had ""Tokyo"" on it.  You also are not able to trade pins in Tokyo Disney.Loved to see a Japanese twist on Disney.  It was a great day."
2302,4,15-May,Indonesia,Great day out for the kids,"Disneylands are all pretty much the same, but still a wonderful place to bring young kids. We tried a few of the rides but so many of them had massive queue's that we sort of gave up and moved onto the souvenir shops which sold lots of goodies. We had dinner here as well and the food was a bit limited by better than expected. Probably will not visit here again for a long time. Overall a great but tiring time."
2303,5,15-Jun,N/A,Still Amazing,"Been here 3 times already.Came at 10am and left at around 8pm. My tip is go visit on Weekdays, non holiday. The queue is shorter and faster and not crowded. Have tried their popcorns Curry popcorn is the best for me so far. Will come back here again and will try Disney Sea.  We enjoyed The Pirates of Caribbean, Big Thunder Mountain and a lot more. Unfortunately, Peter Pan ride is closed until next year."
2304,5,15-Jun,Singapore,There and Back Again!,"Our second trip to TDL in 6 months, summarised below1) Avoid weekends, regardless of what the crowd calendar says (LOL). We were there on a Sunday, and the crowd was relentless. The lines start at least 1.5 hours before park opening, and almost everything had at least 45 mins standby time. FPs were out by mid-day for all the rides. The lines got a little better towards the evening but by then, we were so tired from standing in line to really care anymore.We went again on a weekday (3 day passport) and the crowd was much, much better. It looked crowded but the lines were short(er).2) My son got lost, and it took just minutes for a cast member to send him to Lost Children (next to Monster's Hide & Go Seek). We found him sitting there quietly eating his sandwich while watching Toy Story.3) Compared to my previous visit, I felt there was more effort by the cast members to speak in English. They also took the time to ask about whether you needed extra gift bags for your purchases (yaay for the environment!)4) I am still a little upset to not have gotten the tickets for the Once Upon A Time show. The lottery system is very unfair! Yes, we could have viewed it from elsewhere in the park but all the best spots were taken up. A little oddity here is some people stake their spot for the parades and shows really early. The rule is you can't use your mats till an hour before the show, but they don't stop you from taking a spot HOURS before that. So be careful when walking around the park because you may accidently knock into someone sitting (or snoozing) on the ground.5) Get your hands on the Japanese guide as it lists all the special merchandise and meals available at the park! Really pretty to look at!6) We missed Thunder Mountain and Splash Mountain during our last visit, and we're glad to catch it this time round. They are very good rides, suitable for the whole family! Also worth a visit: Tom Sawyer's Island, which is a large play area with plenty of hiding spots and even water play for the kids.7) Pinocchio's Daring Journey was closed for refurbishment last year, and I think they've updated it with some additional technology but it went so fast, I barely saw anything.8) Plenty of toilets and drinking fountains to keep yourselves functioning.9) Those with kids: use the child switch system to your advantage. Bring the whole family to the cast member at the entrance of the ride, tell them you want to do a child switch. They will issue you a ticket, and one person can go and queue, while the other waits outside with the kids. Afterwards, the second person will get to the front of the line with minimal wait. This comes in handy when you can't fastpass the ride.Another fastpass hack: there is no distinction between child and adult FPs. So you can make use of child tickets to FP your rides as well :)"
2305,5,15-Jun,Indonesia,Amazing Moment,"For any reason you visit Japan,you must go to Tokyo Disneyland on your list. The entrance fee is expensive but after you enter the gate,nothing to worry anymore. All memories that you have in your childhood becomes true. All the venue is worth to see. It was amazing moment for our child to play,to learn and to feel the happiness there. Someday,we plan to visit Tokyo DisneySea too,so our child could tell to their child (when they got married),the best moment they have with us,their grandparents"
2306,4,15-Jun,Denmark,Great and uplifting,"We've been in Disneyland CA and Paris as well, and Disneyland Tokyo is a great member of the Disney franchise.Very nice and helpful staff, the food was not as awfull as it usually is, and thanks to the discipline of the japanese population, you tend to avoid the same kind of ruthless behaviour from pushy parents (e.g. at greeting points), as we've experienced in the two other Disney parks. Not that Disneyland can be blamed for that :-)Only thing to consider is the, at times, awful long lines. Some of the most popular rides had more than 60 m. waiting time. And that's off season on an ordinary thursday! So, be patient, and plan ahead. And consider fast track passes for some of the more popular rides. Oh, and don't forget cash. The only ATM in Disneyland (and Seaworld) was out of cash...."
2307,2,15-Jun,Australia,No email address for Tokyo Disney,"I tried to buy e-tickets from Tokyo Disney Web site, however I got unauthorised card message from the process.  I went to my bank to check my Master Credit card if anything wrong with my credit card, I was in and out the bank 3 times in 2 days. I've been told there wasn't any problem with my Master card.Then I tried to find the email address for Tokyo Disney, it wasn't any email on the web site, finally I have to call Tokyo Disney from Australia.  However not many customer services officers can speak good English. At the end, after 3 times called Tokyo Disney, a girl understand my issue, told me that Tokyo Disney only accept Visa Card for international countries, Master Card only for local Japanese.  But the web site only shows - accept Visa & Master.  It doesn't say that not accept international Master Card.I am so upset with the whole process, not only Master card issue, but no email contact for Tokyo Disney, which century are we living in?   I can understand for Heritage property, but Disney is a modern attraction, why no email contact????"
2308,3,15-May,New Zealand,Disneyed out!,"Admittedly this is the 9th time we've visited a Disney them Park and fifth different site, but we are questioning the value of spending so much in money and time to only ride 5-6 good rides.Sure, if this is your first time to Disneyland or your kids are really keen it's worth it, but once you've been a couple of times the junior rides aren't so inviting, and the waits, even utilizing the fast passes, just seem too long.We purposely chose May for our Japanese visit, as it was not peak season and the weather was warm not hot and very little rain normally. However, Disneyland seemed pretty full, even on a week day.I can remember a time when we went on every ride in a Disneyland park in one day, and waited no more than 40mins.You could go in the off peak - maybe winter, but your whole trip planning shouldn't revolve just around Disneyland.Pirates of the Caribbean was a good ride that you didn't have to wait long for. Space Mountain is another good ride but long waits there - you can on some rides opt for riding single, so you don't queue as long, you just ride with complete strangers to make up the number.Big Thunder Mountain was another ride with excessive waits that we didn't get to try.We did wait 90 minutes(or was it two hours!) in the heat to do splash mountain, and I don't think it was worth it.Monsters Inc ride was also very popular, with a wait time of two hours for most of the day or the fast past meant you'd have to come back in the evening.It was pretty much the same on the Buzz Lightyear ride - but we used a Fast Pass to see in later on. It's a good family ride with shooting targets...The Grand Circuit car ride was not so busy and we got a ride here.Star Tours - similar to California version, but a little better. Very good ride with reasonable wait times.The Go-Gadget rollercoaster is a mild ride, but the adults will still like it.The Roger Rabbit ride is similarly suited to younger people, but we all enjoyed it and the wait was fine.Overall we were left a little annoyed. Maybe we would have been better to go at night??? It's just so busy nearly every day every month. But your tickets before you go to the park, as this will save you time at the park entrance. Come early, as less you have a reason not to. Know in advance the rides you're most likely to want to do, and be familiar with the layout of Disneyland Tokyo. Plan the day ahead, incorporating the Fast Passes.Good Luck!"
2309,5,14-Jul,Indonesia,Exciting!,"Not enough time for a moment to enjoy a variety of rides collection permaian they provide. As a kind of game that exists in some other countries, where it exciting!"
2310,5,15-Apr,Australia,Fun Fun and Fun!,"Disney is a place that bring you happiness. This is the 3rd time I visit and one day is definitely not enough!It just has the magic to make you dream and atmosphere is brilliant!  We went during school holiday and on a rainy day.  The park was fully packed and long queue for everything. However, this does not dampen any spirit in there.  Lots of fun rides and plenty of place to take a rest and recharge for food and drinks.  The parade is not too be missed! For those who are interest in the popular rides, there is a phone app which show waiting time live so you know where to queue for FP when the 2 hours is up! (D„ÅÆÂæÖ„Å°ÊôÇÈñì for iphone)Lastly, don't forget to buy the souvenirs, some are only available in Disneyland!  We bought a lot of cute Easter biscuits and snacks!"
2311,4,14-Jul,Australia,Disney Lovers,My 2nd Disneyland experience since an original LA visit 40 years ago!  More spacious and expanded than former with a pretty Venetian theme in 2nd part of park.  Believe the Little Mermaid theatre was worth seeing for adults too. The water car ride reminded me of how the 'Robomaid' type vacuum cleaners work.
2312,4,15-Jun,Singapore,Enjoyable but more for the kids,The parade was awesome. Most of the rides were meant for the kids. I love the idea of Fast Pass. You can roam the other areas of the park while waiting for the time for your turn to ride. The curry popcorn was damn awesome!
2313,4,15-May,India,Disney's Magic,"Tokyo disneyland is wonderful.It is a must go if in Tokyo.There are lots of rides,parades,amazing resturants and finally the charming  Disney Characters.The only issue for vegetarians are that getting vegetarian food in the park is very difficult.Otherwise it is the best."
2314,3,15-Jun,United States,"Really, you came to Japan to go to Disney World!","We were visiting Japan with friends who are Disney fanatics.  My wife and I had been to Disney World in Florida in the 80s.  Guess what, the one in Japan is identical right down to the location of the hot dog shop.  Really, if you have been before, I wouldn't bother there are many more things to see - unless of course you want to experience ""It's a Small World"" and ""Bear Country Jamboree"" in Japanese."
2315,5,15-Jun,N/A,Fantastic and magical place!!,"Disneyland is more for younger children as compared to Disneysea. The height requirement is only 1.1M (I think) for roller coaster rides. My 4 years old barely managed to reach the minimum height and she had a blast riding on the Splash Mountain roller coaster 3 times! To maximise your time, study the Disney map carefully and aim to ride on your favourite rides first as the queue can get too much and the rides will stop taking in people. Use the ""Fast Pass"" to get a time slot for your rides and then go do other stuffs before coming back. We spent 2 days at Disneyland and 1 day and Disneysea and we still could not manage to finish half of the rides because the queues take a long time. With young kids, be prepared to take it slow as they get tired and grouchy after a long day. Hope you have fun!"
2316,5,15-Jun,New Zealand,A must go if in Tokyo,"Disneyland was to be expected amazing! The only real issue is that everything is in Japanese, my suggestion would be printing off a map in English or saving one on your phone or tablet. Some places accept credit and others don't, so take cash just in case. Check when you arrive what time the fireworks display is as it changes seasonally, we wasted a lot of time waiting for it not knowing what was going on. Well worth the wait! And the food wasn't overly expensive ¬•450 for a huge waffle and ¬•1200 for a main dish (small sized) at the Queen of Hearts restaurant. Also ask what time the parades are as they run throughout the day- ride lines were a lot shorter (5 min or less) during this time. Make sure you get there early and make the most of your day as its awesome"
2317,5,15-Jun,N/A,You can't go wrong!,"We visited Tokyo disneyland on Monday, it was great! To be fair you cannot go wrong with Disneyland but despite us being one of very few English people all the staff made an effort to help and talk to us. The final show at the end of the day was excellent and the lottery for the tickets really made sense, we were lucky enough to get excellent seats in front of the castle perfect end to a great day!"
2318,5,15-Jun,N/A,Splendid,I would really love to go there once more... It was a pleasure to go there. Though it was a bit crowdy but still it was a wonderful visit....
2319,2,15-May,Australia,Too crowded for travellers with limited time,"Queues were too long, multiple attractions were temporarily closed, and very late notice given of fireworks cancellation. Most popular rides had queue times exceeding one hour, even with fastpass use. You stand in queues for hours, for a ride of 3 or so minutes. Sure, the rides we got to were fun ... but the fun to boredom ratio is very low. Your smartphone battery will go flat - amused myself counting how many people still had battery life as the day wore on. And this was on a Monday in an off-peak period. Food outlets were good and not ridiculously expensive."
2320,5,15-May,Australia,Must visit for Disney fans when in Tokyo,You all know what to expect. Great rides and shows for the family. Use the Fast pass for the most popular rides. Fortunately I did not have to wait long for Star Tours which was the first ride I went on when the park opened being a Star Wars fan. Food options are quite reasonable for a theme park. Would definately return if in  Tokyo again. 
2321,5,15-Jun,Australia,Had an amazing time at timeless Disneyland,"Ok I am in my sixties, have always wanted to go to Disneyland since I was 6 years old and I finally made it - although it was in Japan and not USA. But everything looks exactly the same as the American one - even the Jungle Cruise and the Castle that overlooks the entire park. We went midweek so did not find it crowded - we also arrived early. It was an amazing place and I still smile whenever I think of the great time there. Check out the mothers' room with Japanese girls dressed as Mary Poppins - so sweet."
2322,5,15-May,Malaysia,Enjoy!!!!,"Purposely select a weekday to visit Disneyland, still... unexpected crowded. Luckily, almost all the attractions we visited are queue less than 30 min.My Tokyo Disneyland journey:- World Bazaar - Tomorrowland, Draw show ticket (no lucks) - Star Tours: The Adventures Continue - Grand Circuit Raceway - Space Mountain (FP)- Hippity-Hoppity Springtime (Parade) - The Glass Slipper- Cinderella's Fairy Tale Hall - Mickey's PhilharMagic - Goofy's Paint 'n' Play House - Donald's Boat - Chip 'n Dale's Treehouse - Minnie's House - Happiness Is Here (Parade) - Haunted Mansion (FP)- Peter Pan's Flight - Snow White's Adventures - Break at Village Pastry - It's A Small World - Mark Twain Riverboat - Jungle Cruise: Wildlife Expeditions - Western River Railroad - The Enchanted Tiki Room: Stitch Presents ""Aloha E Komo Mai!"" - Swiss Family Treehouse - Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade Dreamlights (Parade) - Happiness on High (music & fireworks) - World Bazaar- Once Upon a Time (far away...)"
2323,5,14-Oct,Indonesia,What a fun place!!!,"Tokyo Disneyland is so huge, takes more than 1 day to explore. The queue was crazy, however there were fast lane ticket that we can get every 2 hours. Make sure to choose the best attraction first."
2324,5,14-Dec,Singapore,Tokyo Disneyland lives up to its name,"We went to Tokyo Disneyland in December. It was really, really cold and the wind did not help a bit. It was very crowded eventhough we went during a weekday. When will Tokyo Disneyland be less crowded? I wonder. Had to give up queuing for the rides at one point. There was a queue at every single ride!The attractions are great, as of all Disneylands. The service crew in all the souvenir shops, restaurants, push-cart stalls were all polite and friendly, even though some did not speak English. They tried to help by all means.However, since there were no Halal food/restaurants for Muslims there, we had to leave earlier as our 2 year old was cold and hungry. We knew from the start and had packed some bread from the hotel. That was the downside of the trip. Nevertheless, we certainly enjoyed our trip there and one day is surely not enough to try all the attractions.  Tokyo Disneyland has its Japanese flavour and culture to it which was definitely memorable to the kids."
2325,5,14-Dec,N/A,"Beautiful, magical place",Every little girl's dream is to go to disneyland and meet our favorite princesses and other disney characters. I just had mine fulfilled. Too bad it was too crowded to go to every attraction. When I come back I'll make sure I get to ride each and every attraction even if I have to turn the place upside down. Just kidding. haha
2326,5,15-Apr,N/A,Slight Confusion Due to Language,"Great amusement park! Was very similar to Disneyland Park in Anaheim, CA. Arrive 30 mins before opening and, if you don't speak Japanese, make sure you are in the correct line to either enter the park or buy tickets (there are 2 separate lines). Get fast passes first thing because lines get extremely long. Was somewhat  confusing because we didn't speak the language but we were able to make it through with English. Great covered shopping area is good for hot afternoons or rainy weather."
2327,5,15-May,N/A,Happiest place on earth!,"Very clean throughout the parks. Staff are very friendly and helpful.We tried going both during the day and night time. The park is not as crowded at night, which makes the lines not half as long as they are during the day.The kids (and adults) really enjoyed themselves at Tokyo Disney!"
2328,5,15-May,Indonesia,The happiest place on earth,"We went there with the kids (4 y.o. and 15 y.o.), and we all enjoyed the park very much. We had 2 day pass ticket, so we didn't have to come early and in a rush. Besides, staying in Tokyo Disneyland Hotel which is located right in front of the park is also an advantage, so that we can come to the park or back to the hotel anytime we want.We also came during weekday, so it's not that busy and the longest waiting time for a ride was about 60 minutes.Clean, great rides, shows and carnival, and being there made realized that happiness is just about seeing the happy face of your beloved ones, as they truly believed that their dreams come true..."
2329,5,15-May,India,Best Attraction in Tokyo,Amazing place to visit. Enjoyed every moment. Should reach early around 8 am to be ahead in the queue and get early fastpass.Should not miss the following outstanding attractions.1. Pooh's honey hunt2. Mickey's philhar magic3. Its a small world4. Pinnochio's daring journey5. Peter pan's flight6. The haunted mansion7. Minnys house8. Pirates of the carribean9. Jungle river cruise10. Western railroad11. Afternoon parade12. Evening parade13. Night show at castle14. Star tours15. Meeting disney characters
2330,3,14-Dec,Singapore,"""Great experience but very crowded""","There are lots of great rides and shows, but what bothered me was the crowds. There were lots of people and in a day, I could only sit 5 rides and watch 2 shows. I recommend   getting a Fast Pass to get to the front of the queue quicker."
2331,4,15-May,Thailand,Where Dreams Come True...,"Where family can spend lovely time together, adult is filled their heart with childhood dreams and children are filled their heart with the imagination. Don't be hurry while you are in the park. Buy fast pass if you don't want to wait!"
2332,4,15-May,Australia,Japanese Disney,"The same format and rides as the whole world over, but it's funny being on rides with Buzz Lightyear telling you ( presumably ) to Watch Out!  or C-3PO ( presumably ) telling you to enjoy the ride.  Even more amusing is the pre-ride lectures from staff.  Again, I presume they are telling us the international warning to ""keep all body parts in the car at all times"" .. but who knows?  The thrill of the unknown made is all the more enjoyable, and we came out unscathed and smiling, and that's all that matters, right :D"
2333,5,N/A,Philippines,Fun but purcahse a fast pass,"Hi guys! Im already an adult but disneyland always makes me happy and is a great location to spend a vacation. Although disneyland  tokyo is big, lines per attravtion is long so if you can get a fast pass get on!"
2334,5,15-May,United Kingdom,Who wouldn't love Disney?,"Had a fantastic day at Disneyland Tokyo. We did go during Golden Week and were a little worried about the queues but it was fine really! We only had to wait an hour and half for the Splash Mountain ride and other rides we managed to FastPass without any problems! Clean facilities and staff, who wouldn't love a day at Disney? I'd recommend getting to Disneyland before 8am to get a good space in the queue so that you can get your first FastPass as early as possible."
2335,5,14-Jul,India,The very best,I have been to all the disneylands and this one was by far the best I stayed at the disney resort and it had the finest of details and a lot of effort was put into the designing and so on disneyland had popcorn stalls everywhere they had a lot of nice ride and it was an unforgetable experiance ......I really enjoyed it
2336,5,14-Dec,India,Disney on Christmas!,"I visited disney Sea world on Christmas day. There was crazy crowd almost 50,000 people at time. And ofcourse who would not love disney.. The park is huge and has 2 parts. Its difficult to cover in a day. Would recommend to go 2 days. Again a drawback was that all shows were in japanese. Provision for English should be made."
2337,4,15-Apr,United States,Great Magic Kingdom Park - Not the Best In the World,"There's a lot to love about Tokyo Disneyland - fun attractions, decent parade, fireworks aren't bad - but I find a lot more to like when visiting Hong Kong Disneyland, Disneyland (California) and Magic Kingdom Park (Florida). This is definitely a good Disney Park, but I'm not sure I'd classify it as ""great"". Food:I felt the food was definitely lacking. However this can be said of most of Japan. There is decent food to be found, but looking back through my photos, nothing makes me say ""oh that was so good"" or ""I'm craving that"". For me, food is a huge component of Disney Parks. So many memorable foods for those that are looking. Be our Guest at Magic Kingdom Park with it's fantastic french quick-service; Via Napoli at Epcot, Tusker House with it's african meets indian inspired options at Animal Kingdom, bread bowls at Disneyland, Dim Sum at Hong Kong Disneyland - all make me thing ""I can't wait to go back and have those again"". The only I thing I can say at Tokyo DIsneyland that met that criteria was Orange Water. That's it.Attractions:Pooh's Hunny Hunt was great, as was Monsters Inc Ride and go Seek. However I felt every other attraction in Tokyo was either a copy of another Disney attraction or inferior to another version. They're not bad, as most Disney attractions, even if copies, are quite fun. But beyond those first two, nothing stood out to me.Merchandise:I'm a huge Disney dork and I love finding new and unique merchandise. Unfortunately I felt that 1/3 - 1/2 of every shop we entered was filled with the same Easter merch or tins of candies and cookies. We did bring a few items home, but nothing was overly unique. I was definitely disappointed by merch here.Cast Members:Cast were fantastic - though we speak very little Japanese, they were very accomodating. Definitely a highlight of our trip to Tokyo Disneyland.Please note that all of my thoughts above apply only to Disneyland and not to DisneySea."
2338,5,15-Apr,Australia,Wonderfull,"Went to Disneyworld in 2010 and had a great time.  Same sort of attractions, etc but the Japanese service was over the top everywhere!  Travelling with some 'mobile challenged' people, I was able to get a 'Guest assistance' pass.  Helped us out with rides and the parades."
2339,5,14-Dec,Thailand,All I want to see on my childhood is completed here!!,"Fantastic, I loved all show and all character I saw in TV is stand in front of me. Wowwwww you can stay here from the first show until last show at night, you will get a new experience of your life."
2340,5,15-May,Australia,Amusing and entertaining!,"Went there around 9am to maximise the whole day we've allotted for it. There was no queue at the ticketing line which was great!It is costs 6900 yen for a one day pass. The ticket is used when you try to get the ""fastpass"" which lets you get on a ride at a certain time without the hassle of waiting in line. The rides were very entertaining although not really excitable but it is a super kid friendly theme park so can't complain.The meals were decent and over priced but what do you expect, right? haha The facilities are clean and well maintained. I like the Haunted Mansion, Space Mountain, Star Tours, Splash Mountain, Peter Pan's Flight and the Winnie the Pooh ride :) You can roam around the whole park and finish riding all the rides taken you have the whole day :)Night fell and indeed, the lights show was magical and spectacular! Brought back good memories from childhood. Overall, the experience was fantastic and would highly recommend going here. I haven't been to other Disneyworld/lands so I have no point of comparison but for my first experience, I'm glad it's in Tokyo Disneyland."
2341,5,14-Jun,Australia,Magic; chaotic and brilliant magic,"This was my first theme park visit ever (friend and I both being 27 at the time), and so bought the two park pass and had no idea what I was in for.Loved every single second of visiting this, the only concern I had coming in to the park was that it would all be in Japanese (my Japanese is okay, but still limited), but that didn't detract from the experience at all, if anything it added to it.We spent literally all day here (staying at the Hilton meant we didn't have to rush off and could stay until close), and went on every ride we could, and ate more of the Mickey and Minnie iceblocks than one person probably should. The waits in the lines are of course lengthy, but that was never a problem, because being in line itself is great fun (so much to see, people to chat to, etc)The park staff are beyond helpful, and the entire experience was as I said, just magic."
2342,5,15-Apr,United Kingdom,Fantastic day with my family,"My wife and two sons (1 and 5) went here last month.  It was actually our second time here and it was as good as, if not better, than the last visit in 2014.From the minute it opened, the park was full of life and energy.  My sons met a whole host of their favourite Disney characters while going on some fantastic rides.  My five year old really enjoyed the Buzz Lightyear ride, ""Star Tours,"" the Grand Prix/motorsport ride (which made him feel like he was a real driver) while my one year old loved the very visual rides like ""It's a small world,"" and ""Peter Pan"" and ""Snow White.""  The kids loved the rides and, if I am honest, I think my wife and I had more fun than the boys.  We have visited Disney Paris but Disney Tokyo is very different and the lack of Japanese language skills on our part did not detract from what was a great day.  I really enjoyed the ""Haunted Mansion"" which had some cool special effects.We plan to visit Japan again next year and will definitely be back to BOTH Disney parks.  A great day and a great finale to the day with spectacular light shows and fireworks!"
2343,5,N/A,Australia,Probably the greatest day of my life!,"Woooooowwww I loved Disneyland!I had never been before to any of them so was super excited just thinking about it.I must admit I am NOT a ride person at all so I did wonder what will we do there all day. Anyway we arrived and just walking in and seeing the sign my smile was HUGE. Toon town was my favourite by far. Everything to do with Mickey, Donald and goofy! I did manage to go on a kids roller coaster without screaming too! I could talk about Disneyland all day but let me just say if is a must see if you are in Japan. The only tiny downside is there is almost zero vegetarian food to be found. I went hungry :("
2344,4,15-Apr,Malaysia,Hong Kong Disneyland better,"My first visit to Disneyland was at Hong Kong, second visit was at Japan.As usual will have to queue 1 hour for every ride.The Japan Disneyland park was similar to Hong Kong Disneyland park, but had it's own unique rides as well.Both disneyland I encounter people just jump into the queue which really annoying.We had the smoke turkey and chicken nugget was very delicious.A little disappointed for the ending, fire works not as great as what I experience in Hong Kong.No matter how long queue is it, I still love Disney very much. Will visit Disneyland in other country as well."
2345,5,N/A,Brazil,"My first Disney, excellent!","I confess, i always thought Disneyland was a major pain. I'm not a Disney cartoon fan, so I thought it was going to be a wasted day.I was wrong, everything there is pretty, the attractions are utmost charm. Every employee is gentile and helps you even if you don't know japanese.A must go!"
2346,5,N/A,Singapore,"""Perfect Day in Disneyland""","Wow! Just visited tokyo this april. Sakura is majestic but disneyland is perfect! I went with my bestfriend and her cute daughter. As perfect as the weather during that time, the que is not long, we had the chance to ride almost evrything... We won a seat in the projection mapping (the new attraction which really left me on awe). Should really make time to see the parades esp the night electrical light parade which we also had a good front view by all chances. Queen of hearts food is just average but enough to sustain us for hours. I enjoyed tokyo disneyland, for my age? I feel im a kid again;) "
2347,5,N/A,Australia,Great visit,"We had a wonderful time at Disneyland. Our biggest mistake was not assessing first which rides would be the busiest and we wasted our first fast pass. Get in early and hit up the rides you really want to do first - get a fast pass for one and then jump on another or you will spend all day in line. Most lines are for about 30 minutes , but the advertised wait time refers to the time you wait to enter the line of the attraction so is not 100% accurate. Adding about 10 minutes on is closer. The food at Disneyland was not as overpriced as we thought it would be, there are ample facilities about and the staff genuinely try and help you even if they don't have a clue what you are saying. "
2348,4,15-May,Japan,Good day,Good day unfortunate was the start of Golden week prices for entry was reasonable compared to other entertainment sites
2349,5,15-May,Indonesia,The Place where dreams come True,i love to come here to see all the fantasies when i was young. This place is huge and so many area theme. Try Indiana Jones and Tower of Terror. They are worthed to try even those took 45 minutes to wait.Family or with couples are recommended to come hereDaisuki desu too see the photo u can see my instagram at jimmy.teddy7
2350,5,15-Apr,Australia,Busy but a magical and happy place,"Disneyland Tokyo exceeded our expectations. We were prepared for long queues, and the fact that the effect of some attractions may have been lost on us as we don't understand Japanese, so we planned our experience with our 7 year old accordingly. We had a very enjoyable day. All queues were well organised and were always moving, the staff were all very friendly and happy, the theming of all areas was fantastic, and there was a magical, happy feel about the place. Our favourite rides were Roger Rabbit, Pirates of the Carribean and It's a Small World."
2351,5,N/A,United Kingdom,Fantastic Park but BUSY!,"You take Magic kingdom and drop it onto the Tokyo Bay area and let the magic commence! We arrived at opening time and I've never before seen so many people queuing to get in, it's a mad rush once the gates are opened and all the politeness and grace that we expect of the Japanese disappears in an explosive of near euphoria. Imagine a prized boxer dog, serene and poised let off the lead and chasing its favourite ball. Madness! The Japanese will queue for anything, we kept seeing people in a long like queueing for no reason, bizarre! Add the weird queues to nowhere to the queues for the attractions and you'll find you spend most of the time stood still. It's a lovely park for sure, but again it's the same magic kingdom you'll see in Paris, LA or Florida. "
2352,4,14-Nov,Malaysia,Fun for children,Nice place to visit but be prepared for the extra long queues for every rides. Smaller than the disney park in Us but definitely bigger than the one in Hong Kong. Love that it is by the sea.
2353,5,15-Apr,Singapore,A theme park that underpromises but overdelivers in more ways than one,"An amazing experience especially with a young toddler in tow. Everything from attractions, shows, foods to staff were impressive. Research research and more research is paramount whether the experience you get is enjoyable. Thanks theme park insider and disney tourist blog especially for your 1 day itinerary. Got Fastpass for Monsters Inc, queued 5mins for Pooh hunny hunt, did river cruise and Western train, also it's a small world and Space Mountain. All these attractions are highly recommended and pack a surprise as to the scale of what they can create in such a small space. Toddler enjoyed Minnie, Mickey and goofy's houses, but not snow whites adventures which imo is a waste of time and too dark and scary for a toddler. Space Mountain is also not for a young one unless roller coaster in pitch darkness is their cup of tea, they're better off with thunder mountain. Ate at grandma sara kitchen and plaza restaurant, decent food and usual theme park prices with the exception of plaza restaurant which was very affordable ¬•600-700 per main course. Ended the night winning the lottery, sitting right in the center and in front of the castle for the Happiness show and once upon a time. All parades and the mentioned shows are incredibly elaborate and worth watching. the toddler got pics with all her favourite characters who linger and come in different shifts to the entrance area, just before the World bazaar. Overall a magical Disney experience..."
2354,3,N/A,Philippines,Fun and Exciting,"I've only been to Disneyworld before, so that would be the basis of my comparison. Tokyo Disneyland is big and should be explored for maybe two days. Everything is clean and the rides are entertaining, but they fail to accommodate foreign tourists properly. Rides that require story telling or voiceover can't be understood by those who don't speak Japanese. They don't offer an English translation.The food ranges from ¬•700 to more than ¬•2000. You can check the map to see how much the restaurants would cost. They also offer hotdog sandwiches and fries if you're not looking for a heavy meal. Like Disneyworld, they offer turkey legs as well for a very reasonable price (I forgot the exact).The merchandise sold is also cheaper than in other tourist attractions. You can buy shirts inside the theme park and feel like you bought them outside because the price is very reasonable.They also offer fast passes for free, but these are time-limited. Some shows are also offered only to those who were lucky enough to be chosen in the ""raffle""."
2355,5,14-May,Australia,So much fun!,"This place really is the happiest place in the world. All the rides were spectacular! So creative and well thought out - even the waiting areas for queuing up had beautiful little details, interactive story lines and characters. The staff are all incredibly friendly, happy and professional. A few tips: - Use FastPass where available: DO stake out the theme park map for where the high demand rides are and get the fast pass for that as soon as you get in the park. You can only get a fast pass every 2 hours. This way you'll make the best use of them all.- Get to the theme park as early as you can. We spent the entire day there and walked till our legs were going to fall off right up to closing time. Only JUST managed to squeeze in all the rides and attractions. Try to split it into two days or more if you have children. Facilities are kept clean and well signed. Food choices are varied and pretty affordable. My favourites were the different flavoured popcorn stalls available at each 'land' around the theme park. Who would have thought strawberry flavoured would be so delicious!"
2356,5,15-Apr,Netherlands,Always good to be here,"Somehow the Japanese are way better at this than their colleagues in Paris and HK. Super friendly staff, extremely clean, everything is very well built and maintained and the fast passes are awesome."
2357,5,15-Apr,United Kingdom,Mickey is Universal,"We visited Tokyo Disneyland pregnant and with a toddler and still got our money's worth. The atmosphere can't be beat, staff was friendly, and the park was clean. We even went on a rainy day and between showers, staff squeegee'd the benches. There were lots of food choices, but the local favorite is the different flavored popcorn. They had everything from butter, caramel, and honey; to more exotic tastes like curry and soy. Overall a great visit and not hard to get to on the train."
2358,4,15-Apr,Singapore,Get transported back into your childhood,"Overall, it was a really great experience and it totally brought me back to my childhood. Do check the expect crowd meter online before buying your tickets as the waiting may vary a lot according to the crowd. Recommended to do prior search on the FASTPASS system as there are some popular rides that have long waiting standby times. Strongly recommend for you to pay a visit if you are in Tokyo!"
2359,5,N/A,N/A,Dream of my daughter,Visited disney land for quite a few time but first time with my 4 years old daughter.It was her dream for last couple of years and as she traveled to Japan for new year holidays with my wife we made a visit to disney land.Since she is very young we took evening pass and rome around disney land and enjoyed few kids ride and shows. She loved mini o mini and small coaster. Also night parade was fascinating for her. This is great place for kids. However super crowded on holidays or any day of the year. 
2360,5,14-Oct,Indonesia,You need more than a day!,"It's very crowded!! Even in weekdays! Had to spend long times to wait in lines. Use FASTPASS if possible. I ended up have to wait until 9.30 PM for fastpass to Haunted Mansion, and that's my final ride. I advise you to reserve two days visit for Disneyland and another one day for Disneysea if you're a theme park lover!Unfortunately, I can't find any t-shirt that has ""Tokyo Disneyland"" printed. For food, we have to queue for a long time too. But, I had a great time here!"
2361,5,N/A,Philippines,Simply awesome,"Be sure to check the web for tips on crowd predictors as it does get crowded especially on holidays and weekends.  We chose a weekday to go and there were still a lot of people around.  Lines were very orderly and they really do a very good job of ""herding"" the crowd in and out of the rides.  We chose to skip the parades especially at night so we can get into the rides that normal had very long lines.  A day isn't enough to explorer everything and it would be more convenient if you can stay in the hotels in the resort so you can rest your weary feet after a long day of enjoying the park."
2362,5,14-Jun,Australia,The place were dreams come true with Japanese friendliness,"Magical place, just as you would expect Disneyland to be, the rain did ruin parts of the day especially the fireworks which were cancelled however what made this place even better were the staff, so enthusiastic and friendly.  It seemed they were more happy about being there, such a great day"
2363,3,N/A,N/A,A little disappointing for teenagers,"Today (end of April) we went to Disneyland Tokyo. This is by far the cleanest, well maintained and well organized amusement park we have ever visited. Japanse staff was great and very helpfull. However, teenagers could be a bit disappointed with the not too exiting rides. Be prepared to wait in line for more than an hour or more. Search the internet for best days to visit. Tip: purchase a free fastlane ticket first thing for the most popular ride (among other things Splash Mountain and Space Mountain). "
2364,5,15-Apr,Japan,Dream world,Frozen projection mapping was awesome! Unfortunately I couldn't get the show ticket but if you stand around the Cinderella castle you could watch it!!  It's showing only for limited times. Night jungle cruise was great too!!! :)
2365,5,14-Sep,Australia,Don't miss the Electrical Parade!,"Our time was tight in Tokyo and it was a last minute decision to take my 13 year old granddaughter to Disneyland on our final evening. We bought 'After 6' passports but if I did it again I'd plan to spend the whole day and evening there. The Electrical Parade was amazing and went for a satisfyingly long time. We found a great spot along the route with park benches and only one or two rows of people sitting in front of us. Our view was unrestricted and we are happy with the photos and videos taken with our phones. After the Parade, there wasn't much time for rides as it closed at 10pm and the lines for most rides were still quite long. I'm glad we managed the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. Evening was great for the parade and the spectacular sound and light display on the castle, but I think you also need to be there during the day to enjoy more rides and appreciate it fully."
2366,4,N/A,United Kingdom,Amazing place to spend a day,"Ok, Firstly I 100% agree with the previous reviewer about how it's all about your mindset. Yes there are long lines (some very long) but if you go early and utilise the fast pass system then it's really manageable. Rides are unique and alot of fun, my wife and I spent 11 hours there! Word of warning though it's not geared towards foreign tourists as all rides and commentary use Japanese. There is very very minimal English used so be prepared to have no idea what's going on!"
2367,5,14-Jul,Australia,What a Magical Place,"I loved this place, we took my teenage daughter and to be honest I felt like a child again. I loved watching the beautiful Japanese people, the teenagers dress up and dance to the parades. It is such a magical place to go too.  The staff are so friendly, it truly is a happy place. I Would recommend this place to anybody."
2368,3,N/A,United States,Spend more time in lines,"Overwhelmingly crowded.  We had spent more time waiting in lines than riding them. 3 hours in line for Monsters, Inc, 2 hours in line for Haunted Mansion, 1 1/2 hours in line for Pirates of the Caribbean & got lucky to get fast pass for Space Mountain. We came just before the gates opened & left minutes before it closed.Lines for food as well. Hard to find a table to eat. The lines for popcorn were looong. But I must say that the lines are very organized.Everything were in Japanese including the songs in the rides.  We had a lot of fun though just being able to go see Tokyo Disneyland."
2369,5,15-Apr,Australia,It Really Is The Happiest Place On Earth,"What a fun way to spend a day for young and old. A little planning on the rides is needed or you will be in line ups for a lot of your day. Get fast track tickets that allow you to book a time to come back for your ride. Watching  thousands of people walking around in Mickey Mouse ears relieving childhood dreams is a sight to be seen. So much to see and do. Make sure you have a full day there, two would be better."
2370,5,N/A,Australia,Swept up in the magic of Disney,"This is my first Disney experience so I can't compare to other parks, but this was the most amazing experience! We arrived an hour early in mid April on a Wednesday and went through quickly. We managed the park in a day (fast passes helped greatly) but I would have loved one more day. We were going to get a 2 day Disney pass in Australia and I'm glad we didn't because the days I would have selected were pouring and FREEZING. Instead, we purchased our tickets from the Disney store in Shibuya where we were staying and selected 2 days about 2 days in advance when we knew the weather would be clearer. The night time story book castle light show was the absolute highlight. I was lucky enough to get a lottery ticket to the seating area so this made it even more special. I can't recommend Tokyo Disneyland highly enough, from its staff to the rides and the cleanliness. Use the website to forecast crowd volumes and try and catch a day that suits."
2371,4,15-Apr,Singapore,Wow..,"Disneyland, the place where fairy tales come alive! Once you step into the park, it becomes so magical.. You will begin to bask in the Disney atmosphere and the background music.. It doesn't matter how many times you have been there to the park.. You will still enjoy walking around and even people watch if you are not into rides.. Plenty of restaurants, food kiosks and vending machines through out the pArk. Traveling with young children, diaper change is readily available In Every toilets. Ground crews were also very polite and helpful. All in all, a very nice experience! You may need to purchase a 3days pass if your are into rides as it takes up a lot of time queuing. This pass enable you to visit one park at a designated day each and on the last day you can choose to visit either one. Do check out their website for more details."
2372,4,N/A,Singapore,Must Go and Prepare to Spend more than 1 day here....,"My first trip to Japan last December. This is my first Disneyland visit ever... Honestly, as my trip was impromptu not much research was done... As Singaporeans, we were simply amazed by how huge this theme park could be...My only complaint is that I did not plan and did not spend enough time here! It is so huge that I would think a 3 days will be good... The tickets are priced by park and day. The snacks cart are simply fascinating! Popcorn of all favours... And of course everything the shop sell in cute and irresistible! Bought the Halloween Mickey Mouse T-shirt & many other things too...We only got a day ticket for Disney Land...I'm planning to return next year, staying at the hotel within the theme park and spend 3 good days here. I would recommend anyone visiting the theme park to do more research and plan more time for the theme park.I'll be back!!!"
2373,4,15-Apr,Myanmar,It's Disney,"The place is magical. For those who like princesses and cartoon characters and for those who like things like heroes and robots, you'll find them there. Magic mountain, splash mountain and other rides will be there for your amusement. I, for one, especially liked the band doing their rendition of classic Disney songs. Plus, the food there may be a bit pricy but it did taste delicious. Definitely go there and spend the whole day. A place for all the members of the family."
2374,3,15-Apr,Singapore,The most crowded place during the trip,We spent 8 days in Japan and Tokyo Disneyland is the most crowded places we been. We entered at about 11am and left at about 6.30pm and we only managed to take 3 rides. Only 3 rides!!! Most rides the queue is about 2 hours. Nevertheless the parades and shows are very good and entertaining. 
2375,4,15-Apr,Singapore,Worth every penny!!,"Disney Land - the home of Mickey Mouse!! The experience in Disney was great as the rides were magical, bringing you through the land of the fantasies. The weather was fine when we went but at night it was pretty cold in April, 10+ degree. The Japanese had a great playing attitude as they were mostly dressed in the Disney character hats or clothes. Really absorbed themselves to the land. Didn‚Äôt think I will enjoy so much but I did. I think Universal studio in Singapore need to do more work. The Peter Pan ride was great and the pirates of the Caribbean, with Jack Sparrow was very authentic. There were many live performances to entertain guest throughout the day and night. They do allow you to leave and come back again with a stamp on your wrist and the ticket. There are also many souvenirs that are affordable and reasonably priced. There are cute kitchenware that I would love to purchase if I have the luggage space and extra cash!At night, there were electrical powered light parade with beautiful floats and fantastic light illumination on the castle with awesome fireworks as and when. It is a must to go and enjoy the lighting. Noted that when they said that they will cancel a show, do not leave your spot and they will compensate with another show. That was what happened to us. Nonetheless, we did enjoy the whole trip. =)"
2376,4,14-Jul,United States,disney again,"I'm not naturally a big fan of amusement parks, but being a dad forces you to be one. I first came to Tokyo Disneyland in 1985 while in the USMC stationed in Okinawa then again 5 years ago with my son on our trip through Thailand, Nepal and Japan.  He was 10 years old then and had a GREAT time.  Now I find myself back again with my 3 year old twin daughters and they had a GREAT time as well.  Here's a tip to make your visit a little more comfortable (particularly if you're visiting in the summer as we were):  Get a Starlight Passport for entry after 3pm on Saturday and Sunday.  It's cooler, less crowded and cheaper.  Win-win-win!  You can get a Starlight Passport for the weekdays as well, but entry time is after 6pm.This park is similar to the Disney park in Anaheim, with similar attractions, shows and CROWDS, but Tokyo seemed to be much more organized throughout.  And the food was a little different - there were ramen noodles in my hotdog (???)We really don't indulge in the ride experience because our girls have NO real desire to ride rides (thank God).  They just wanted to see Mickey and Minnie, so the long ride lines didn't effect us, but I did notice that they were quite long throughout.Disney DOES offer re-entry into the park (unlike Universal Studios) which is a great option if you want to leave, get something to eat and return at a cooler or later time. The girls gave us the ""we're done"" signal about 3 hours in and we noticed on our way out (around 7 pm) that numerous people were taking advantage of this.Disney is a great brand and a great experience whether you're visiting Anaheim, Tokyo or Orlando."
2377,4,15-Apr,Australia,Tokyo Disney - The Happiest Place in Japan,"I really enjoyed Tokyo Disney, I've never seen so many people so dedicated to Disney's characters.  So much cosplay of Donald, Mickey etc and the amount of adorable Asian children made my ovaries hurt.  I think the castle was the biggest positive for me, this was the first time I could go into it and the Cinderella displays are a delight AND you get to get photos sitting on the royal throne!It was also pretty great that no matter what show or whatever I was trying to look at, I didn't really have to worry about seeing over other people.  I'm about 5'8"" and sometimes struggle at western places, but Tokyo DIsney was orderly about everything from the parades, to the shows, to queuing up for rides.  They don't have the Matterhorn, but I didn't miss it much and the food is definitely superior to Disneyland and Disney World.  Everything else was just as good as Disneyland and the general atmosphere was much better - parents at Tokyo Disney just seemed to be able to handle their children better than my previous experiences at American Disney Parks.  No gaggles of screaming, disruptive children.  No parents yelling at screaming children in a desperate attempt to control them.  No sad, tired faces that you generally see on parents at Disneyland at the end of the day.  No aggressive place holding for parades or fireworks.  Just a lot of people getting along, being supportive of children and the elderly, lots of polite attempts to communicate with us Gaijin.  I would highly recommend, except I can speak a small bit of Japanese - this makes everything a whole lot easier and more entertaining.  Many rides are entirely in Japanese, so they're lost on you if you can't understand the language.  Rides like the Jungle Cruise, Star Wars The Adventure Continues and many more don't come with subtitles or in English (This is likely obvious to most - you are in TOKYO Disney afterall, but my husband was a bit surprised and disappointed as he doesn't speak a lick of Japanese except 'please' and 'thank you.'  Overall, I would highly recommend, the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's very far away from the city and my husband didn't have nearly as good a time as I did.  We did our best with the language barriers, but sometimes it meant that he missed out on a lot."
2378,5,15-Apr,Australia,Awesome as always,We have just come back from our second trip and loved it as much as the last time. Crowds were very reasonable in April and the weather was quite rainy on a few days so this meant small queues. We did all the rides we wanted and did our favourites over and over. Loved all the popcorn flavours. Dream lights parade and the Once Upon a Time show projected onto the castle was an absolute highlight. We tried our luck at the ticket ballot each day and were lucky to get seated tickets on our last night. Do not miss it!!!
2379,4,15-Apr,Thailand,Disney Magic,"There is no doubt Disneyland spares few expenses when creating its theme parks. The detail and upkeep of the buildings are first class and simply walking thought the park is an experience itself. The Disneylands are unique and should be experienced if at all possible. Be prepared for crowds and long waits of up to 2 hours on the most popular attractions: there is a fast-track line at many attractions which you should take advantage of if at all possible.  Except for the long queues, the Disneyland experience is flawless, the people are well trained and have a great attitude, and is a must-see in Tokyo."
2380,3,15-Apr,United Kingdom,Probably the weakest of all the Disneylands (and I've been to them all),"Visited with my wife and 5 year old daughter on Friday 10th April 2015.  Arrived at the park at around 9.30 and was able to buy our tickets instantly - no queues!The park remained relatively ""empty"" until around 12pm when there was suddenly a noticeable increase in visitors.Unlike, the Hong Kong and Paris Disneylands, the Tokyo park really only caters for the Japanese visitor.  All commentaries etc are only in Japanese.I personally felt that this was probably the worst of all the Disneyland parks (Florida, California, Paris, Hong Kong), although it did feature most of the rides you would expect eg Space Mountain, Small World, Jungle Cruise etc etc.Maybe the fact that we were probably still a little jet-lagged (and hence tired all day) has led to me having a less than positive view of this attraction."
2381,5,15-Apr,Singapore,Marvelous!,"The day we went to Disneyland was a cold, rainy day. Although showers were predicted from 10 am onwards, we were lucky that it started only around 4pm, when we were already half way through the park with most of the rides we're eyeing covered.Rides we took: Star Tours, Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters, Space Mountain, Grand Circuit Raceway, Goofy's Paint and Play House, Roger Rabbit Car Toon Spin, Monster Inc. Ride & Go Seek, Castle Carousel, Mickey PhilharMagic, It's a Small World, Alice's Tea Party, Pinnochio's Daring Journey, Pirates of the Caribbean. Saw the Hippity Hoppity Springtime parade and Happiness on High fireworks.Somehow, Space Mountain here was better than Hongkong Disneyland's. I loved Toontown, where we could tour around Donald's Ship, Minnie's House, Goofy House, Chip 'n Dale's Treehouse. It's so cartoonish, so cute. Childhood dream came true!We were also impressed with Mickey PhilharMagic show, although everything was spoken in Japanese :)The park was clean, well-maintained, equipped with enough information and amenities. However we could see that during peak period it would not be possible to cover everything in one day, although the park closed quite late at 10pm.Staff were very friendly and approachable. Food was good, with interesting presentations."
2382,5,N/A,N/A,Great,"The is the biggest Disneyland, about 7 times bigger than the one in California. It's located quite a distance from the city but it's easily accessible by car or train. It really huge and difficult to complete all rides in a day. They are many exciting rides as well the easier ones for young children. The staff are great. I like the kiosk and restaurant which serve some local food as well which is nice. Very enjoyable experience"
2383,3,15-Mar,Malaysia,A Sea of People!,"The large number of people at Disneyland was worse than the crowd at Disney Sea. It was insane! We were extremely lucky to have been able to go on 4 rides considering the crowd! Fast trackwasn't feasible due to the crowd and so the other possible thing to do is to find a suitable eatery  to tuck in. Even that was impossibleto do without queuing for hours!Since it rained in the afternoon for a short while, we decided to shop for some Disney memorabilia in one of the many Disney shops in the park. We did get in but it was congested with so many people trying very hard to get to the items they wanted to purchase. It was utter madness. My daughter with sheer determination in her eyes, managed to successfully grab 5 Frozen stationeries from the shelves. She was happy with that purchase.The highlight of the day was in the evening when we got to watch the laser show at Cinderella's castle.Even then, it was difficult to get a good viewing spot as many of seated areas were reserved  for the winners of a lucky draw competition. But the show was spectacular!  The icing on the cake was the Electric Lights Parade.It was really worth it ,to watch your Disney characters dazzle you in a multitude of coloured lights costumes, props and vehicles."
2384,5,15-Apr,N/A,"Excellent, as always.",Had a great time with the family. It wasn`t so busy so we were able to go on rides we hadn`t been on before.
2385,4,15-Apr,Sri Lanka,good,"good place if you have small kids. not many thrilling rides for adults expect the space mountain,big thunder mountain,star tours. scary places like haunted mansion is NOT scary at all. so if your over 17 you have nothing much to do. but for the experience its good. lot of people in the lines. some good rides expect to stay about 40mins. japanese people are very polite and nice. overall good experience. entrance 6900 yen"
2386,3,N/A,Australia,Ok,"Got to Disneyland about 8.30 Wednesday , the lines were already huge. Got into the park at 9. Maybe we were just lucky on that day who knows, but via both fast pass and lining up we barely had any wait time. We were pretty much done by 12 o'clock and attempting to drag out our time until the parade in the afternoon. We gave up waiting around with not much to see and left by 1. I've been to Hong Kong Disneyland, so I was expecting more from Tokyo? It was not as Disney decorated and the rides did not seem as entertaining. The rides were a ""it was good/ok but once is enough"" , the food as well did not seem so appealing. Though the next day we went to Disneysea with our 2 day pass, and I got to agree with the other reviews that it is way way better! The detailing on the amusements is great and the food on this side is a tad better."
2387,4,15-Mar,Sri Lanka,Good Place but not for non-Japanese people,"Nice place and well organized. BUT only caters to Japanese tourists. Commentaries are mostly in Japanese (Haunted Mansion, Star Track etc.).  If you can't get a fastpass then you will be spending hours in lines, waiting."
2388,4,14-May,Indonesia,FUN but too many people,always have love disneyland. this is better than what i was expected also with the number of people that was there!
2389,5,15-Apr,Philippines,Wonderful,"This is perfect for all, be it a couple, with friends and families. The place is huge and awesome. I was already pleased with Hongkong Disneyland but Tokyo Disney is huge in comparison. My only wish is that they should put some English subtitles for other people to understand. But being in Disney,no need for language after all it is place for fairytales and beautiful memories"
2390,3,N/A,Malaysia,Go when your kids are small!,"I like all the attractions, which are inspired from Disney characters. But the park wasn't successful in crowd management; most rides take about 1.5-2 hrs queuing. That's not so cool if your kids are toddlers. Attractions just for viewing are a lot better. Also be prepared to pay for pricey patented souvenirs that are made in China mostly.  If you have toddlers, join the bandwagon but if your kids are teenagers, they'll be too old for this theme park. Take them to Tokyo Dome instead,  more animes and phantomines to indulge in. The park closes at dusk but stick around to catch the signature fireworks above Cinderella Castle!"
2391,5,15-Apr,Japan,Amazing experience!,"We arrived on Monday April 6 and left Saturday April 11.  We picked an amazing time to go, if you don't mind a little bit of rain!  It wasn't too bad actually.  We had practically NO waiting on anything. In fact, I think the longest wait time was 50 minutes.  We went to both parks and were able to ride everything with relative ease. The show Once Upon a Time (the night show) was absolutely fantastic!  We went with our three kids (3-6-11) and they loved it!  We all had an amazing time!"
2392,4,15-Apr,United States,Worth going,"We just got back from our trip to Tokyo.  The kids (9yo, 10 yo) were keen to go to Disneyland having been to DisneyWorld and Disneyland Paris.  But it was spring break in Tokyo, the park attendance was forecasted to be in the black/highly crowded zone, and reading the reviews here about the very long lines, I wasn‚Äôt terribly encouraged.  But we decided to go and I‚Äôm glad we did.Here are our observations‚Ä¢ It wasn‚Äôt too bad to get to the park.  We were staying at a hotel in Roppongi, and it was an hour trip via train.  We took the Metro to Hatchobori Station, then switched to the JR Keiyo line to Maihama Station.  From the Maihama Station, you can walk to the Disney park entrance or take the Disney monorail.  It was a lot easier than I thought it would be.  The Metro ticket vending machines have an English option so it was easy to buy the tickets.  The JR Keiyo ticket vending machines also have an English option, but when it comes time to pick a station, all the station names are written in Japanese!  But I was able to press a customer service button and a little window opened and an attendant could help me.  (Basically I learned that I just had to press the 220 button, as this was the fare to the Maihama Station).‚Ä¢ We took the Disney monorail the one stop to Disneyland from Maihama Station.  But coming back, you may just want to walk back (assuming you‚Äôre not too tired).  It‚Äôs not that far, but the train is on a loop, so coming back, it‚Äôs three stops to the Maihama Station and the monorail seems overpriced ‚Ä¢ We read the tips for the busy park days:  get to the park early (preferably 30 minutes before the park opens), buy your tickets online, go straight to the ride you want to get a FastPass for, then wait in line for another ride while you wait for your FastPass time.  On the day we went, the park opened at 8 a.m. ‚Äì and it was too ambitious for us to get there that early.  So we got there at 8:30 a.m., with our pre-printed tickets (I ordered them online and the hotel front desk printed them out for us) but we found there was no waiting to get in.  Once through, two of us went to Buzz Lightyear and the Fast Pass time was about 1:25 p.m., the other two went to Splash Mountain and the Fast Pass time was 2:45 p.m.‚Ä¢ The park was crowded but it didn‚Äôt feel over-crowded.  The Japanese are quite polite so there was no pushing or shoving.  It was also a little rainy in the morning which may have reduced the crowd factor.  It‚Äôs true that the popcorn lines were incredibly long ‚Äì not sure what it is about the popcorn that‚Äôs so amazing.  But fortunately other food lines weren‚Äôt bad.‚Ä¢ Even if there are long waits for most of the rides, some will still have short-ish lines.  The line for It‚Äôs A Small World moved quickly and the wait was just 15 minutes.  (The attraction is a little rundown at WDW but seems new and clean, by comparison, here!).  Buzz Lightyear showed a wait of 120 minutes but we only had to wait 20 minutes, and when it showed a wait of 70 minutes, we only waited 10 minutes ‚Äì this line moved quickly on the day we were there.  And then you can always see the parade.  People start to find seats along the route an hour before the parade, but even 30 minutes before the parade starts (at 2 p.m. on the day we were there), good seats were available.  Also, the railway around the park (Western River Railroad) won‚Äôt have long lines‚Ä¢ We ate at the fried chicken place near Adventureland.  The food was really good, we even went back for seconds of the fried chicken, and the lines weren‚Äôt long.  We got there around noon, there were multiple cashiers and maybe only seven people ahead of us in line.So if you‚Äôre on a trip to Tokyo and your kids really want to go to Disneyland, it‚Äôs possible to go and have a good time even when the park is crowded!  It may have helped that I‚Äôd read the reviews and we went in with low expectations, but we all had a great time and were glad that we went."
2393,1,N/A,Australia,Unbelievable wait time for EVERYTHING,From food lines to ride lines and even smoking room lines(for my husband) this was by far absolutely mind blowing. They should not sell more tickets knowing that it is vertically impossible to go on all the rides if the wait lines are close to two hours. We were not impressed. What we found amazing was the attention to detail for all the rides. That was nice to see how well everything was. Other then that. We wasted a day lining up and really on rode on three ride. Disappointed 
2394,4,15-Mar,Indonesia,super crowded!!!,"been here on the 1st spring weekend, super crowd. very long queue for a popcorn, we need to wait for empty table and seats at the restaurant for lunch and tea/coffee break, 1 hour even more to enter the park.lucky we bought the fast pass, still queuing but not as crazy as the normal pass. the parade was amazing!! sad it was raining in the afternoon till evening, makes it very cold."
2395,4,15-Feb,Australia,A whole New World,"From the moment we got on the Disney platform to the magical glow parade it felt like we were truly in a ""whole new world"".  This was our first time going to any Disneyland so we can't compare it to other Disney Parks. We went to Disneyland first and it was extremely crowded despite being a weekday. There were lots of children visiting with their schools. Some lines were very long, we waited at least an hour for a few. Express pass would have been handy.The haunted house also had a long line but was worth it. Some rides were closed for maintenance. We did not get to go on everything. The castle experience is a must! We got to visit inside and as I found from speaking to friends this is not a perk experienced at other Disneylands. At night the whole thing glows up and it's very magical.The next day was Valentines Day and we went to DisneySea. This was via the special Disney Train which made it all the more wonderful. It was snowing that day so crowds were less and we got to go on all the rides in half the length of time it took for Disneyland. The snow actually added to the ""sea"" atmosphere as we were quite drenched by the end of it. All in all it was a great experience."
2396,5,14-Oct,N/A,Best Disneyland i've been to!,"I went to Disneyland Tokyo back in October so we caught all the Halloween festivities. It is by far the best Disneyland i've been to. There are a lot of different rides to go on, so much so we upgraded our 2 day tickets to 3 days so we could get on everything. We went on a couple of days that a typhoon was hitting Japan so the park wasn't as crowded as it normally would be. I recommend to get the Mickey Mouse shaped waffles with chocolate and ice cream, so delicious! I highly recommend to visit this Disneyland as the attention to detail here is superb from all the novelty shaped food in the restaurants to the amount of merchandise you can get in the shops. It beats the other Disneyland's hands down and I can't wait to go back!"
2397,4,15-Apr,Australia,Classic rides,"You have your classic rides like Peter Pan, Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, Tea Cups as well as rides like Star Wars Tours, Buzz Lightyear, Roger Rabbit.  It was a pleasure going through It's A Small World, as all the rides at Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea are sponsored by companies and are in top condition, clean and fresh.  The park is also very clean as with Japanese etiquette you do not eat whilst walking therefore you either eat at a restaurant or cafe or Japanese people bring tarpaulin type mats and at designated areas sit down and eat.The think that keeps my ranking down, as with DisneySea, is the lack of merchandise choice.  A lot of stores that are nearly empty and have practically the same stock in all stores with 60% being various types of rice cracker tins or chocolates.  The best is the refillable popcorn holders that hang around the neck. There was Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Alien, Mr Potato Head as well as special edition ones.Also remember that ONLY CASH is accepted to by tickets at resort or make any purchases inside the park. You can purchase park passes online as there is an English version and can then pay by credit card or through travel agent."
2398,1,15-Mar,United States,"I like Disney, but this is worth skipping","I decided to take a friend with me to Tokyo Disneysea based on the rave reviews online. It was a colossal waste of money. There were insane wait times for the rides, with the longest we saw being 3.5 hours. Just not worth it when you've traveled to Japan and there are so many other things to see. If you grew up visiting Disney World in Orlando, this is worth skipping cause it will leave a negative impression."
2399,5,14-Oct,N/A,Happiest Place on Earth,"My husband and I had the best time at Tokyo Disneyland. There is so much to do and see, and if researched and planned prior to arrival, you can have a stress-free day. See my write up if you like for how we went a bout navigating the park. http://lovemisswalker.blogspot.com.au/2015/04/tokyo-disneyland-japan-travel-diary.html"
2400,5,14-Jul,Australia,Another Great Disney Experience,We started our adventure by staying at a Disney partner hotel on the monorail loop.The park was Disney as we have experienced at other parks.   It was early July and school was not on holidays yet which made the park less busy than other times.Lines were not too long.  It was a good time.
2401,5,14-Jun,United States,DisneySea is a must-visit!,"A trip to Disneyland completes any visit to Tokyo. Both parks are crowded on a daily basis, it seems they never have a ""low season"", but it's totally worth it. Disneyland is much like other Disneylands around the world (HK, Florida, Paris) ... but DisneySea is where the magic is! It truly lives up to the most ""magical place on earth"" feel. Don't forget to try all the popcorns!"
2402,5,15-Mar,United States,"Beautiful, but very crowded",I went during spring break and it was very busy.  The wait time on rides was anywhere between 2 hrs and 4 hrs.  I was able to go on several rides thanks to a special assistance pass.  I am a total Disney fan so I would have been happy just being there and seeing the place.  It is hard to imagine but the rides were even cleaner than at Disneyland CA.
2403,3,15-Mar,N/A,Beware of long queue,"Our family of four with 2 kids survived this very crowded Disneyland trip on the 18th March 2015. Mostly teenage Japanese students had counquered the entire theme park. Long queues of between 2 to 3 hours were expected on the popular rides. As this was my 2nd trip to Disneyland, after the one in California, we already knew what to expect in such a place. If it were not for the long queues, and the bad fast-pass system, it would have been a great day on a great weather. If you haven't been to Disneyland California, this would be a great place to go. The place was also very clean, very well maintained and Disney souvenirs are expected to be pricey. Better to go at least on a 2 days pass to enjoy Tokyo Disneyland. And yes, no camera tripods were allowed. Take note of that."
2404,4,15-Mar,China,Must arrive the park before it open,"We arrived before it open and queue outside. Therefore, we were able to play a few new attractions in the first hour without much queue. Since we were visiting on the spring break vacation of local Japanese school ,after the early morning, the queue were very long."
2405,1,N/A,Singapore,Ridiculous lines and stupid fastpass system,"Arrived with my wife and were unable to get on any rides at all without waiting 3h+. To make the system fair they should allow only one fastpass per day per person...now i basically paid for seeing a parade and waiting in line to get water, ice cream and popcorn and a chicken leg...could have done most of that anywhere else in Tokyo. Will not return as Tokyo has much better things to spend precious time on...The Kingdom has lost its magic"
2406,4,15-Apr,United States,Spring break vacation,Disneyland was great üòÑ lines to every rides were very very long! Shopping was great and eateries were very reasonable. My suggestion when you enter the park is to get fast passes to the rides you want to do first. Get a disneyland park map and start marking things you want to do. Restaurants are crowded especially when it gets closer to noon.. So make sure you have snacks or something to eat before getting on lines to the rides.
2407,2,15-Mar,Singapore,would have been simply awful without a positive attitude :-),"in short, i find the good reviews below head-scratching... very pretty place, but the ridiculous over-crowding is well, ridiculous! if you must go, please go in with low expectations, and a huge dose of positivity :-)"
2408,4,15-Mar,United States,It's Disney,"I had a lot of fun at this park, but as in all the Disney's around the world lines are long. It's a smaller park, but there is so much to see and so much to do. I went during spring break so there was a lot of people and the lines were crazy but all in all it was magical. Very clean place and it's just beautiful. The parades were great, the staff everywhere was very helpful. And as reminder bring cash not every place accepts cards & the places that do, they only accept credit cards. You can spend all day there and still not have enough. Have fun Disney fans! (P.S Food is really good)"
2409,3,N/A,Malaysia,Crowded and limited rides for small kids,We visited during a school holiday season. So the place was packed and each ride you need to wait for at least 45 min or up to 2 hours. Many rides have limitation so if you have kids below 2 years they can't take many rides.We wanted to eat fried seafood at one of the restaurant but was informed that the breaded ones are made from pork as part of ingredients. That was dissapointing.Another challenge for Muslim traveler beside the food is there is no place for prayer.Visitor must check availability of ticket or be prepared to be disappointed. Disney has quota for the day. We had to return on another day to be able to go in.The night parade was beautiful but fireworks were cancelled due to strong winds. Another didappointment.
2410,4,N/A,Singapore,Disney mania,Went there with three young kiddos! What a day... It's stormed the whole day ha ha and it so happen to be a school outing for a high school...u can imagine.But it was still a great experience.. Love the frozen movie parade...The kids love the rides.. We got a fast pass at 10am for a 4pm ride ha ha imagine the amount of people. A must do! Try the soya sauce and butter pop corn.. Electric feeling but be warn.. The queue is longer than the queue for the ride.
2411,3,N/A,Australia,Disappointing,"We visited Tokyo Disneyland March 22nd, 2015. We only had one day passes. It was insanely crowded, which we expected. We arrived at opening time, fully expecting and hoping to stay until closing at 10pm. The lines however, prevented this. By 8:45 the lines were over an hour long, by 9:15 the fast pass times were for after 8pm that night. We used the fast pass facility on the first ride we came to at 8:30, and got given the time to come back between 11:30 and 12:30. Off we went to fast pass another ride only to find out that if you have already got a fast pass, you can't get another one (in my case till 11:00am - and by then the fast pass had been exhausted for all the rides). After this, all ride lines were over three hours, even with thousands of people watching the parade. Sadly we ended up going home at 3:00, disheartened, having only been on 3 rides in 7 hours, and even having a fast pass for one of them, we had spent well over 3 hours in a queue. The lines were also ridiculously long for ice creams and food. The only place the lines were not long was in the souvenir shops. The kids (and I) had really wanted to buy a souvenir of our time at Disneyland, but it was all pretty much a waste of money. This Disneyland is nice, it is just unable to cope with the volume of people that visit there every day. On the plus side, the rides we went on were good. Would not visit again. My Tip for people who do want to visit: Get more than a one day pass and stay at a close Disney hotel. Go early and straight to the ride you want and then straight to the next one you want to fast pass while sending someone else to stand in the queue for your third preference while you get the fast pass. Obviously people who went regularly knew  this as many people had come prepared with ground covers to sit on and things like iPads to use while in a 3 hour queue. Good luck Disney fans!!! "
2412,5,15-Mar,Germany,"First time, but won't be the last","Never would I have dreamed of such fun in a theme park. I don't like theme parks. But this one I had to try. It was Disneyland, after all, and I had never been to one. About time! So I went during one insanely busy time (don't go during holidays!) but still had a lot of fun.The train ride from the city takes a little under an hour and if you feel particularly lazy or luxurious you can use the Disney train to take you directly to the entrance gates or even stay at the local hotel. In any case, the entrance queues were alright but inside all hell broke lose. You had to queue literally hours for everything!My advice is, go to visit the 'boring' stuff first, such as characters' houses, have a stroll through the park, head over to Tom Sawyer's Island, grab a snack or one of the iconic flavoured popcorn packs and wait until about 5pm when the crowds lessen and waiting time is about 30 minutes for the rides. There is a special ticket for coming after 6pm with a reduced price, too.Also, check the schedule for special events and shows to be there early so as to get a decent spot (Japanese people tend to come equipped with a plastic picnic blanket and food) and not to miss out on anything. I thought some was a little childish but I still enjoyed it! The happy jumping time, though, was more for the little ones. You absolutely HAVE to see the Storybook projection onto the Cinderella castle at night (usually 2 showings). It is hauntingly beautiful and I got serious goosebumps.  Another show I really liked was Minnie oh Minnie, which was a latin-inspired cabaret show mostly sung in English. For other events, it sometimes is possible to get a translation (such as with Stitch). Ask the staff about it.My conclusion: I loved it and would go again. The price is also alright for a day ticket currently costing 6400 YEN (prices are to increase in April). You don't need to be or take a kid with you to enjoy this. It might even be more pleasurable because you can just do what you want."
2413,5,14-May,N/A,Happiest place on Earth~,"Disneyland Tokyo is easily accessible by train. Staffs are fun and always putting a smile on their face which makes your day too. Be there early if you have yet to purchase the entrance tickets before hand as the queue can take quite a while. FastPass runs out quickly on rides that are more popular, so do some research before heading there. There will also be crowds who are willing to wait for more than an hour just before the parade starts thus planning is important. Even though my family do not understand Japanese, we still enjoyed our day there and managed to take almost all the rides in the park in one day. Overall, Disneyland Tokyo is a must go and truly the happiest place on Earth!"
2414,4,15-Mar,India,Good Experience,"The place is really good, a nice tip would be to visit the place on the weekday. Visiting the place on Sunday would end you up in long queues for a single ride."
2415,1,15-Mar,Singapore,disgustingly long queues,"Fast passes(makes the q time shorter) can be taken however while holding on to fast pass of one attraction, you cannot get the fast pass for another. burdensome. do enter early and just get the fast pass for one ride that you really want to sit. a total disappointment for the price paid. "
2416,5,15-Feb,Philippines,Disneyland is indeed the happiest place on earth for teens and parents alike.,"Very accessible via train. We traveled with 2 teens and they enjoyed it tremendously.Entryway of Tokyo Disneyland will already make your heart beat with anticipation of a grand time. Lots of rides and attraction selection. Disney personnel understands and speaks English. Very accommodating.Lots of food and souveneir selection.There are several shows and parade schedules.One will not get lost here because there are clear signs everywhere.Lots of clean restrooms.There is also a luggage center where those who will go here straight from the airport can keep their luggage so they can stroll Disneyland hassle free.No matter how many times one has visited Disneyland in any part of the world, the wonder and happiness will always be there. Disneyland will always be the happiest place on earth."
2417,5,15-Mar,Malaysia,fun fun fun even for mommy like me,"eventhou we do not understand the language but we enjoy every minutes there. the starwars ride, monster ride, pirate of the Caribbean ride and others. we manage to take 8 ride and one ride with fastpass. go early in the morning. we stayed at hilton tokyo bay and reach disneyland around 8.30 am but the park already full of people. lucky we stayed near the park. we choose to take the starwars first so queue is only 15 minutes. before going planning the ride and timing first. at night there is electric parade that was awesome. but weather for me is cold and windy. overall disneyland tokyo is clean and fun fun fun even for an adult. "
2418,5,15-Mar,Malaysia,Magnificent castle,"Too crowded during peak season! The ""Star Tours"" is a nice must try attraction. Not very impressive if compared with its counter part in Disney Sea."
2419,3,15-Mar,Philippines,it's Disneyland,I suggest only go here if you have lots of time in Tokyo or you'll end up using up all your time queuing (200 minutes for one ride!!) or better yet don't come here anymore if you've already been to the other Disneyland :-)
2420,5,14-Oct,N/A,Makes you feel like a kid again!,"No matter how old you are, as soon as you step into Disneyland, you're a kid again! Queue early and get your tickets from an online travel agent if you can. Then you can quickly get to the turnstile. Plan your fastpass ticket wisely because you can't hold two at the same time. So before you get on a ride, try to get a fastpass for the next ride you really want to try so you can save time. Food is affordable, and the Disneyland merchandise there is worth buying!I had a really amazing time and would love to go back there again!"
2421,4,15-Mar,Australia,Takes you back to your childhood,"First the Pro's It's Disneyland - if you haven't been before you will get so excited seeing the princess castle.  The park is amazingly clean, not a scrap of rubbish anywhere. The attention to detail is unparalleled. Every single prop, every single building, every single everything looks like it's meant to be there and is in perfect condition. No expense spared and the park just puts a smile on your face. The parade's were great and there was a few of them and the storybook projection (one at 7ish and another at 8ish) were brilliant. I bought a novelty donald duck hat and wore it all day along with many others. I just loved it.The Con'sLines, Lines, Lines - there were lines for everything! Rides could get lines up to 3 hours long and there were ridiculously long lines for things like popcorn, ham bones and well everything had a line. The crowds were also pretty insane at times. The park isn't necessarily big so the crowds are always there. Even the kid rides like the tea cups had an hour wait.Tips: Firstly buy your ticket before hand (the line to get in will still be long but it moves fast), use the FASTPASS - it will be your best friend when it comes on going on some of the rides you want to go on. Study the map before you go and go straight to your favourite ride to fast pass it when you first walk in (ignore the princess castle for a bit, you'll come back to it) and as soon as it's available again use the fast pass again. Take a bottle of water (some of the restaurants didn't have water) and I had two unsuccessful attempts at getting water from the vending machine (as it was in japanese I didn't really know what I was ordering) and finally be prepared to have absolutely no idea what anyone is saying (unless you speak japanese of course) I would have liked to have seen some of the movies played at the start of the rides (like the simulators) have english subtitles. Although we were the only two caucasians in the line up for Star Tours I wouldn't expect them to translate what the staff where saying but subtitles on the movies don't cost anything and would have made the experience slightly better. Very enjoyable day despite the crowds - could not wipe the smile off my face"
2422,3,15-Mar,Singapore,"If you are not prepared, all you will remember is being in a queue","We had a 3 day magic passport and chose to spend 2 days in DisneySea and only 1 in Disneyland. First up, if the dates of your visit is flexible, avoid the weekends at all cost and do check the Disney Crowd Calendar on Google before selecting the days of your visit. We were there on a 90+ day (its a scale of 0 to 100) and all I can say is that it is a real dampener to the magic of Disney. Do your homework before going. This sounds a like a silly thing to do for a trip that is suppose to be fun but unfortunately, the only way to enjoy Disneyland in Tokyo is to do your homework. Do not underestimate the crowd level regardless of how many Disneylands you have been to. The Japanese can queue very patiently and they queue very early. Queues of up to 3 hours is the flavour of the day for all the good rides. So, identify all the Fast Pass rides on the map. Head straight for your Fast Pass, and on it will be the time to return for that ride and the time you can take the next Fast Pass. Take note of this time and do not miss it. The crowd snowballs as the morning goes by so delays in each Fast Pass pushes back your next available ride. Do note that when we were there, the crowds were so massive, that Fast Pass exchanges were over by noon. There is a queue for everything - from food to character photo taking to popcorn carts. While queues are expected in any amusement park, these were some serious queues. 3 hours for Pooh Bear, 3 hours for Space Mountain, 2 hours to take a photo with Mickey Mouse (slightly less for the other guys), 1 hour for Dumbo, 1 hour for the very mild jungle cruise. Food will take you between 30 minutes to 1 hour of waiting. I would recommend heading to Ikspiari for lunch (I have written a more thorough review for Disney Sea and Ikspiari as well)I am a big Disney fan and even then I found the Frozen parade to be a let down. It wasn't a parade - it was Elsa Anna and Olaf (who was somehow really tall) singing on a float. 10 minutes of that, and that's it. Do not queue for this or book a seat. You can just head to the parade area at the last minute and stand behind to watch it as the crowds are very good at sitting in the front rows so you won't be be blocked (some kids may be blocked though).Yes, the 8 pm show is great but we had the unfortunate experience of being there when it was raining. For those who think that the rain or the night hours drives the crowds away - i can assure you it does not.Go prepared for the crowds. Between the 2, our personal preference went to DisneySea as the crowds were somehow more manageable and personally the night show was better. You will definitely need 2 days to finish this if the crowd levels are high. Do try to plan it for a day that isn't so busy else its hard to say that you enjoyed Disneyland Tokyo."
2423,1,N/A,Australia,Worst day ever!,"We thought going mid-week would be a good strategy for reducing crowds... How wrong we were. We paid 64,000yen per adult, lined up for 3 hours on 1 ride and were then told that there was still an hour to go!!!!!!! We left the park immediately extremely disappointed and robbed of our money. We understand that theme parks have lines and have visited numerous parks all over the world, but this is by far the worst park we have ever been to. An absolutely waste of money!!! Line up for a popcorn stall was over an hour!!!! You cannot get into any of the restaurants as they are all packed with lines and lines of people. Even the food areas are fenced off like ride lines to line people up. I cannot understand how the locals even fathom going there when they realise it's going to be at least a 3-6 hour wait in a standing line PER RIDE and a 1-3 hour wait for food. Unbelievable. I would estimate over 100,000 people at the park today and that is no exaggeration. They need to limit guests to a cut off of a least half of that! I would definitely not recommend going here. It is a waste of time and money. "
2424,1,15-Mar,United Kingdom,"Avoid, avoid, avoid!","Expect to queue four hours for a ride with absolutely no toilets or waterfountains etc. to speak off. I'm used to queuing at theme parks, but that was simply torture. The Japanese seem to have a system of swapping in and out I.e. holding the line for others which slows everything down. Note the fast track system has queues just as long to reach the machine so no help there. Oh and a mere 90 mins wait for bland popcorn!Also, apart from the hats everyone is wearing there is no clue that it's actually Disneyland - where are all the characters??Seriously, I would pay money to never go again. I will pay you money not to go! I can only assume Disney is putting false reviews on TripAdvisor. Completely understaffed and overpopulated. Please avoid!!"
2425,4,14-Apr,Canada,Love Disney,"If you are visiting the Disney Resort and have to pick only one, I would suggest DisneySea as there is no other one in the world. BUT if you have smaller children, Disneyland is probably better as the rides at DisneySea are geared more toward older children/teens/adults. It is still very interesting to see Disney in Japanese, and for me, it is worth seeing!TIP: if you are not sure, look at the Twilight pass and visit Disneyland at night for a few hours. Cheaper but you still get to see. TIP2: the food here is a lot of fun! Churro heaven....so many different flavours! And the popcorn obsession is fascinating!"
2426,1,N/A,Singapore,"Very poor, ripp-off","It was a beautiful wednesday when we visited. People friendly and helpful, the park nice and clean. Problem: waiting time for every single attraction 2 to more then three hours. Even with the fast pass one can not visit more then two rides during the day - after paying 250 s$ entry for the family and a one hour ride with the train. Complete ripp-off. Not worth the effort nor the money. Youcane do much nicer things during the day in tokyo with kids, then paying disney a lot of money and the kids being dissapointed in the evening. "
2427,3,14-Apr,Australia,Disappointing for die-hard fans,"I love Disney. I really do. I found that Tokyo Disney land was very involved with the really new Disney movies. The park was basically themed around a handful of movies - Alice in Wonderland, Monsters Inc., Toy Story, Cars, and Winnie the Pooh. That was pretty much it. Disney Princesses were extremely minor, and old favourites like the Lion King, Aladdin etc. were nowhere to be found. It was really disappointing from the perspective of an long time fan. I've been to both the Florida and California Disney theme parks and Tokyo is the bottom of my list. On top of that, we were only able to get on about 2 rides because the queues were nearly 2 hours long each. Unless you have a ticket that lasts several days, you're never going to be able to ride more than 3 in a day. Overall, I was pretty disappointed, but as it was still Disneyland, I was happy nonetheless."
2428,3,15-Mar,Australia,Good but not great,When we arrived in Japan it was during the school holiday period so we purchased night passes thinking the day crowds would have disappeared. How wrong we were.....Not that we didn't enjoy our visit but the park is just as packed as it is during the day and a number of rides were either closing early or weren't open at all. If you plan on attending just be prepared for queues no matter which time of the day you go!
2429,1,15-Mar,N/A,"wow, so so bad!!!","What can I say,even my 5 and 7 year olds didnt enjoy the day! This place is a very cutsey Japanesey kind of place, but there is absolutely no way we are going to stand in line for 306 minutes for a ride! even the queue for popcorn was 1 1/2 hours, Crazy! Subsequently  we didnt go on any rides, ate hardly nothing and left feeling disheartened at the experience. No where to be seen were any Disney characters in costume (like most other theme parks)  and it was mostly ott merchandising. The hilight of the day was the frozen parade ( again 1 1/2 hours just so u get a spot) and the only reason it was entertaining was because Elsa was actually a man in drag, only in Japan!!!!"
2430,4,15-Mar,Malaysia,Feeling young again,"I purchased eTicket in my home country, for entrance after 6pm, almost 2 weeks before the actual date of visiting Disneyland which is on a Friday.  Entrance Ticket is only 3900 yen per person.  It was long queue at ticket counter even though it is after 6pm but for us, we just scan our eTicket and we are in.  Queue was long for most rides but we managed to finish what we wanted for less than 2 hours.  For instance, Pirates of the Caribbean has long queue, but with 20 pax per boat, it took us a short while to reach our turn.  Along the queue, there are water cooler to quench our thirst.  Good planning and efficient."
2431,3,N/A,United States,Kids only ,Went with my sister and had such high expectations. Got to the park and half the adult rides were closed. The adult rides were already very slim and to have half the rides down for renovation was disappointing. A lot of things weren't translated over especially on the star wars experience. 
2432,3,15-Mar,Malaysia,Long queue even on Weekday,"The park is big, however the queue were too long; at least 30 minutes ride. The crowd were a bit too overloaded, and basically you couldn't take a nice photoshoot without anyone photobombing. The rides were too dull for adults; but the parades and shows bringing back our childhoods memories though. Fireworks is the main attraction for me, it was simply awesome."
2433,3,15-Mar,Malaysia,Crowded,"Bad timing got us to Disney during the spring vacation.... therefore lines were long.  Kids are not queue friendly, so a 150 min wait for space mountain is a no-no, especially at 11 in the morning!  Would be good but find a better schedule... Oh, and all kiosks and restaurants don't server water!!"
2434,4,N/A,Canada,A happy place to be ,"I personally thing Disneyland is such a happy place to be. The area is clean with wonderful theme music every where. The rides are great and there's many varieties for many ages. The food can be quite normal and expensive at times, however, I suppose that's expected. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys disney or just theme parks in general. "
2435,3,15-Mar,Australia,A very disappointed visit.,"Myself, partner, brother and friend went to Disneyland on Friday and we were extremely disappointed with our experience. We arrived there at 10am where we had to pay by eftpos as we forgot to get cash out but conveniently they didn't accept MasterCard debit card, so had to pay by the MasterCard travel cards - which was ok  as we thought we could have gotten cash out once we got in or would be able to pay by debit card but we were wrong.We walked around for ages  trying to find an ATM. Finally after looking for them we found them but much to our surprise they only accepted Japanese and Chinese cards.We were pretty peeved off about this as being an internationally renowned theme park you would think they would have atleast 1 ATM that accepts international bank cards!We then proceeded to have a look around with ambitions on going on a few rides but that was soon squashed by having people lined up for so long with a wait time of 3 HOURS to get on every ride!After a few hours of walking around just looking we decided to go find some lunch. We had to wait an hour to line up for some pizza and then when it came time to pay they were extremely reluctant to use either of our MasterCard debit card and the MasterCard travel car, so we had to argue for them to use our cards.We knew they worked as my brother and friend used their cards to pay for popcorn when we first got there.Finally we managed to communicate with them and tell them to just swipe them as they work!I then later on wanted to buy some souvenirs but were told again that they don't accept our cards.I gave up after that and we sat outside waiting for the bus.They defiantly need to make a few major changes to how the place is run by having at least 1 ATM that accepts all international cards, less people being allowed to enter because it's ridiculous paying $65 each just to walk around for a couple of hours because the lines are that ridiculously long to be able to get on any rides and they need more English speaking staff.Overall not a very positive experience for us and would not recommend to anyone."
2436,5,15-Mar,N/A,Enjoy from a morning to the evening with your family.,"Tokyo Disneyland is the amusement park it's possible to enjoy from a morning to the evening with the family. It's crowded at any time of the year around, so I'll recommend to enter early in the morning. I have the ticket as ""the first pass"" which can take part in an attraction with priority, so when this is acquired, it's convenient."
2437,2,N/A,Malaysia,Mixed feelings about Tokyo Disneyland ,"Most people I know love this place but personally, I can't help but make comparison to my own experience of the Disneyland in Anaheim.  ProsVery clean, courteous and friendly. ConsThe wait for rides are too long. Fast pass finishes really quickly and some rides waiting time is 2 hours! Even buying popcorn takes 30 minutes! And it is quite strange (for me anyway) to see the characters speaking in Japanese. It seems to me this Disneyland is really under capacity. For anyone who wants to experience Disneyland, I would say either go to the ones in USA or get at least 2-3 days pass for the Tokyo one because you don't really get to do much in a day. Most of your time is just spent waiting in queue. "
2438,1,N/A,United States,Tokyo Disneyland/Sea not for Tourist...,I have been travelling to other parts of Japan which is not as famous to Disneyland such as Niseko but my experience with young children to Tokyo Disneyland was quite a disappointment. I was early at 8 am and bought a two days ticket to both parks. The ticketing officer right to waiters could not communicate in English (this is Disneyland). All the rides except the not so famous ones has fastpass similar to other Disneyland but I was quite surprised that it was all issued out quite fast on a Thursday and a non-school holiday. It took me and my kids 4 hours to take the ride on 'Journey to the Centre of the Earth' and another 3.5 hours on the 'Tower of Terror' rides. Our 7.5 hours just gone waiting and imagine with two young kids.The place could drastically improve if they have more English speaking attendants. Imagine if u need any Emergency assistants and you go doing your monkey acts just to make the person understand what you want to say. It may sound familiar to some but I am just sharing my opinion.
2439,5,14-Apr,Colombia,LOVE this place...,"We have gone to Tokyo Disneyland at least 10 times...it's clean, fun and a quite an experience! One of our fondest memories is that, being in Japan, you bring a small mat to sit on the ground (shoes off) to watch the parades. I love the people watching there too - the women can somehow manage sky-high heels and boots while walking around! Sun or rain, we loved going..and rainy is actually a little better = shorter lines.  Get there when they open, and leave when they close! If you can, don't try to go to Disneyland and DisneySea in the same day...that would be tough. Each deserves their own day.  The lines can be long, but we NEVER had a rude, obnoxious person ruin our day, so it didn't really matter."
2440,4,14-Sep,United States,Tokyo Disneyland.. awesome but not so much fun for the English speaking Traveller,"I went on a solo trip to Tokyo Disneyland as i was travelling through Japan with my husband. Going to Disneyland has always been a childhood dream so how could i skip this opportunity. Disneyland can be easily reached by the metro train which has a direct stop at Disneyland. Once you reach there is an option to go to the main Disneyland or the Sea World (Disney Sea). You can buy a day pass for both but can only do one in a day, so I would suggest you prioritise. I obviously chose to go to Disneyland. It is relatively simple to buy a ticket and enter (easy directions point you where to go) and like any other Disneyland it is magical!! Get yourself a map and start exploring. Start at one corner and go around. My only grudge was that  all ride announcements and shows were in Japanese, well it was obviously so because it was in Japan, but it can get boring sometimes when you don't understand what the Crew is saying because they say it with so much energy and enthusiasm you wish you could be a part of it. Lines will be long and it will be a long wait to get to rides especially if you end up there on a weekend like i did. Three ways of beating the crowd is:1. Go on a weekday2. Go as early in the day as you can3. Get yourself the fast-track passes for the popular rides (mind you those also get over if you come in late) Overall it was super fun, even though I went solo. Food is great with enough stalls and restaurants serving you quite a varied fare, so dig in! There are great merchandise stores also all along the park where one can buy all the Disney memorabilia one wants. It was definitely a fun day spent in Tokyo!"
2441,5,N/A,N/A,Happiness is really here.,"This is my first time in a disneyland. At first I thought only my toddler will enjoy this attraction. I did enjoy also. The park is toddler friendly. What i mean by this is that strollers are allowed. Strollers have designated places for parking while we enjoy an attraction. Tokyo deserves to be regarded as one of the safest cities as we have not lost any item that we left in the stroller. There are also diaper changing stations but we love to do it in the baby center. We are satisfied with the attractions that we can enjoy with our toddler being admitted. The parades made me recall my favorite disney characters. It is also priceless to see my toddler's happy face seeing the Frozen animation movie characters especially Olaf. The highlight for me is the Lights, Sounds and Firesworks show in the Cinderella Castle. Once upon a time is for us to create after all. Very practical and memorable advice.  "
2442,4,15-Feb,Australia,Got to love people,"An interesting experience, never seen so many people at one place. Yes the lines were long but there was always something to distract you. Staff were helpful and friendly, food lines were quite reasonable except the popcorn lines which were crazy.A long good day was had by all."
2443,4,14-Apr,United States,Fun to see but very crowded,"I split my day between DisneySea and Disneyland so I'd have a chance to see both parks. By the time I got to enter Disneyland it was already early afternoon and the park was very crowded. The rides had pretty long lines. Most of the lines were about 45-60 minutes, with Splash Mountain at 120. I waited 30+ minutes for Splash Mountain even with Fast Pass. The rides are pretty similar to the Anaheim park, with some small differences. I didn't experience long lines for toilets/food and drinks like some other people. I think it's worth a visit especially if you're a Disney fan, just don't expect to be able to go on many rides if you go during a busy time of year."
2444,4,N/A,Indonesia,Beautiful place as dream come true,"Well, my suggestion is dont go there on the peak season: holiday season or on the weekend if u want to play lots attraction. Just cant stand with the queue. They also have the parade for seasonal occasion like halloween or easter."
2445,4,N/A,Egypt,Without Fast pass u will not play,I recommend for everyone is going to disney u must go earlier as u can to get the FP because all the games u will wait minimum 60 mins ... But overall all you will feel like a child üòÇüòÇüòÇ 
2446,1,15-Feb,United States,Heartbroken girls aged 6 and 8,"It was a dream for my daughters to visit Disneyland, and we finally saved up enough money for them to go. It was the best Christmas present they had ever had...Unfortunately when we arrived it was incredibly busy. The highlight of the trip for my girls was to see Elsa (Frozen), but there were too many people watching the parade, so they had no chance of seeing her when she traveled past on her float -even though they knew she was there, they couldn't see her because of the crowds. They were heart broken because that was what they were most looking forward to. The staff there kept of telling everyone to ""get down"" and ""sit down"" so basically we had no chance, because lifting on top of shoulders or trying to get a view was impossible.They also didn't get to ride any rides, since the wait times were just ridiculous. The only thing we could really do was line up in the souvenir shop to buy a toy.It's not just the waste of money that hurts, its the dismay and heartbroken look on my daughter's faces that their dream trip was simply that -- a dream. Its quite deceptive the photos of this place. The reality is its just crowds of people shoulder to shoulder, impossible to get onto any rides, and forget about seeing any characters. I'm not mad, just really disappointed and sad. Disneyland -you broke some girl's hearts. I thought you were supposed to make kids happy."
2447,2,15-Feb,China,GO IF YOU LIKE 2+HR QUEUES,"Got there at 7am on a Feb Monday, people already sitting out of the ticketing areas. When i got to Tomorrow land first, 15 mins after opening only captain eo had fastpasses left at night. Space mountain, monsters inc and buzz had queues around 150 mins each. When i rushed to the other side of the park for some luck, none of it. Splash & big thunder no fastpasses and queue at 2hrs. Luckily pooh had fastpasses for nighttime, so i got that and queued for splash, which i got on at 1pm. Then queued 100mins for big thunder and 2hrs for monsters before having dinner and pooh at night. Even at 9pm, before i left, most rides still had 90+mins of queues. Somewhat wasted money, i think. But rides were decent and fun for me + kids."
2448,4,15-Feb,Australia,Wonderful but EXTREMELY crowded...,"I visited Tokyo Disneyland a few years ago and didn't notice the crowds as much as this time... but still had just as much fun as I did during my last visit. It was winter when we visited but we were lucky to have the most perfect of blue skies. The wait times got intense, as did the pushing and shoving but overall we had a wonderful time in the park.There is so much merchandise to purchase, and the detail of the park alone is finer than its big sister (Disneyland park in Anaheim). We got on the rides we wanted to, and I got some amazing photographs which is all I can ask for. Be prepared to queue for everything, food included, but that comes with the Disney territory, regardless of which park you're in. You will have a blast, as it is truly fun for all ages. Make sure you scan your tickets to see if you have won the lottery to view the evening show 'Once upon a time' in the seated zone (the ballot is located near Tomorrowland Town Hall). We were unlucky... So goodluck.Enjoy your time here... It's Magic!"
2449,5,15-Feb,Philippines,Enjoyed Tokyo Disneyland,"Been to HKG Disneyland several times, but Tokyo Disneyland is so much better.  Enjoyed the rides.  Hope they will have English version of the shows."
2450,5,14-Oct,United States,Good time!,"The place is nice, it's rather strange to visit and see everyone is Japanese since this is my first Disneyland outside US. It was a Saturday, and I find it strange that I saw lots of students with uniforms visiting in large numbers. I think that's the rule there to wear uniforms even during weekend school trips. I also saw a bagpiper and he is a young, tall, white guy! We asked for a picture together and he didn't mind, very friendly. Disney characters are very, very popular in Japan, so there is little surprise that it is always crowded in weekends."
2451,5,14-Sep,Philippines,A child again!,"After a tiring business trip in Tokyo, my friend and I decided to unwind in Disneyland just to experience it. Everybody says it will bring out the child in you, and I thought it was overrated. But oh my, everything changed when we got off the bus and saw the Mickey Mouse railway transit! I wished we took the train going there instead of the bus. And there we were standing in front the big Mickey Mouse arch! Going pass that entrance is a totally new world. It was a hot day in Japan, and we forgot to bring our hats. We immediately saw a souvenir shop and decided to buy items to protect us from the scorching heat. I got Mickey Mouse sunglasses and a hat. We also bought Minnie Mouse ear headbands to complete the fun! Talk about being excited huh! And so we're fully geared for our whole day adventure. :)Though the queue lines were very long, it didn't matter. There were a lot to see -- the place, the people, and Disney mascots! We went there during Halloween and you can't help but follow and dance along with the parade while having an ice cream or a turkey leg for snacks. We had as much rides as we could, shouted as loud as we could, and walked as much as we could. There were mist sprayers in some areas to refresh visitors. Every setting was a different experience -- even the restaurants. I could go on and on to express my joy and excitement during that day. At night was the most awaited Disney parade, we stretched our legs and sat at the gutters side by side with other visitors. I prepared my camera to capture the the whole parade in video. Then came the dazzling floats, the magical music and awesome fireworks. To my embarrassment, I almost cried, haha! Good thing my friend and her sister didn't notice :P So there, I admit it! Disneyland does bring out the child in you! Can't wait to experience it again but this time, with my husband and daughter, and we'll come earlier. :)"
2452,4,N/A,Ireland,Freaky,Never been to a Disney resort before so didn't know what to expect. You catch on quickly on how things go but still only got to go on a few rides for the day. But the whole experience is a lesson itself in branding. ( alien pasta anyone) it's amazing.  Had a ball though and got the Disney experience out of my system for good . 
2453,4,15-Feb,Singapore,Happy Paradise,"It was my first visit to Tokyo Disneyland. It was raining the whole day but it still didn't dampen our spirits! However, just a note, families travelling with children, I would suggest you check the weather condition before going as there are some rides/shows which had long queues which might not have sheltered, it wouldn't be nice to get drenched in the rain as the children might fall sick. We skipped some of the rides as it was raining, were afraid to fall sick for the remaining days of our trip. Parades were cancelled due to bad weather as well. Rides are popular, such as Big Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain, it's normal to queue! On an average, 90 mins each for both rides. Chit-chat with your friends while queuing, or consider getting fast pass! ( We didn't get as we were on budget) The place Is crowded at all times! (Top attraction bound to attract people - go with that thought ) So do check out if there are any off-peak periods. Check out the Temporary Closure of Park Facilities before your visit to avoid disappointment."
2454,5,N/A,Australia,Exceeded every expectation,"Honestly I was sceptical about the trip to Disneyland at first, especially after reading reviews saying it's a waste of money, long queues, etc. We arrived really early before the gate was opened, and it was raining too so we were a little miserable. But once I was inside, it's like I was in another planet. The price of food and merchandise were reasonable (in comparison to other theme parks in Asia like Everland in Seoul), and they were of a better quality too. My family really enjoyed all the rides, sure we had to wait up to half an hour in between but it was well worth. We saw both the morning and evening parades both were fantastic, and stayed back for the firework after that. I have to say it was one of the happiest days of my life."
2455,1,15-Feb,Japan,total waste of money,"went on a weekday, total waste of money. we rode one attraction, the wait for everything was just too long(3 hours). even going to the bathroom we had to wait in line. couldn't ride anything, all the fast passes were gone, we gave up after 3 hours and went home. the whole place was packed out. wish we hadn't bothered.couldn't even get into a restaurant to eat a meal. very disappointed"
2456,2,15-Feb,Australia,Awful,"Went on a rainy Monday but still absolutely packed. 2 hour wait for most rides, even queues for popcorn!  Food and trinkets very expensive. Give it a miss and go to Universal Studios in Singapore instead, where they seem to have worked out how to cater for huge crowds."
2457,2,15-Feb,United Kingdom,Dreadful,"I would not recommend anyone to go here, unless you're an adult who likes dressing up as a disney character and don't suffer from calustrophobia, We took an 8 year old girl mid week on rainy day. She was jostled by adults constantly, there was nothing in the gift shops for her apart from a few dolls. The dreadful food offered very little choice. Most restaurants offered 1 child meal. There are two parks, that you have to catch the mono rail between. You have to pay to use it. We had a fast pass which allocates you a time & the wait you will have to get on a ride. The only one we managed to get on had us waiting for 1 hour 20 minutes. Hardly, fast. Also, there is a waiting period between making fast pass bookings. A rip off. A truly awful place."
2458,4,15-Jan,Australia,Good enough for a visit! but probably won't be returning...,"As a 23 year old, I still found this place magical! I loved every minute of it, and in retrospect, I am very glad I went.However, the attractions are definitely aimed a younger crowd, and I probably won't be returning. Definitely worth a visit though!The little martian sweet mochi buns are so cute and yummy, as are the pizzas, and the bakery goodies :) The parade is worth sheduling your time "
2459,5,15-Feb,South Korea,Dream Come True,"Having lived in California most of my life, before moving to Korea to teach, visiting the Tokyo Disney Resort has been a dream.  I was not disappointed and hope to return some day.  It was a great trip, fantastic park, and wonderful cast members.  They did the Disney name proud."
2460,4,15-Feb,Australia,Pick your day,We unfortunately timed our first day to coincide with Chinese New Year and a Japanese school holiday.... The crowds were insane!! We went without food and drink all day as the queues were almost as long as for rides. Some rides had queues over three hours long. Went back the next day.... no crowds at all and we had a ball! So pick your day!
2461,2,N/A,China,Extremely long queue and no new games,"We went to the DisneySea since it was the one and only DisneySea in the world. However, the trip turned out to be very boring. We only played 4 boring games for 6400 yen Adult since we have to wait for more than 2 hours if we wait for those that are suitable for us. As I have been to the Disneyland in California, I found out that almost all of the attractions are copied from USA. I will definitely not go to here again."
2462,4,14-Aug,Japan,excellent spot for adults & kids,"always the best place to visit in Japan, especially with the kids, wife, boy/girlfriends!!!"
2463,5,N/A,N/A,Best Disneyland ever!,It was best Disneyland I've ever been too! All of staff are well mannered and helpful. Electrical parade was the highlight so make sure you don't miss it! I would suggest to purchase 2 day passport and stay overnight at Disney Resort so you can visit both Disneyland and Disneysea.
2464,4,15-Jan,United States,The most well-mannered Disneyland ever!,"We enjoyed our day at Disneyland Tokyo.  We got to do all the things that you do at any Disney site - meet the characters, do the rides, see the great parades and wonderful light show at night.  If you are going to do Once Upon A Time, you need to get there early and in front of the big tree (to avoid a disrupted view).The staff at the resort were great!  We so loved our time there."
2465,4,15-Feb,United States,Unique and Wonderful Experience,"As a Disney fan and someone who has been to parks in California and Orlando multiple times, this was just awesome to experience the uniqueness of Tokyo Disneyland. There are some major differences in the attractions, people, merchandise and food. Lines are not the most organized to enter the park so try to blend and squish in with the crowd.  I visited on a weekday in February and the crowds were still insane. I cannot imagine a more popular time of year or holiday. Plan to get here early when the park opens otherwise you will not be able to obtain fastpasses for the more popular attractions like Poohs Hunny Hunt and Monsters Inc. Upon entering the park, people will be literally running to the fastpass lines and they queue up right away although the lines for the fastpass move pretty fast and the lines are fairly organized within the park.  We arrived about 15 minutes after park opening and were still able to obtain a fast pass for Winnie the Pooh which was scheduled 2 hours later. Our next fast pass was available a couple of hours later as well and we were able to get one for Monsters inc. scheduled for around the time was park was closing meaning it was just about to stop distribution. Fastpasses for most other rides sold out by 1 PM. If you have a baby or small child, definitely exploit the alternate rider system as much as you can. There seemed to be restrictions  on obtaining a single fast pass for a person in the group and then trying the alternate rider on certain rides though. For some reason they wanted all persons in the group to have a fast pass in order to perform the alternate rider switch. A little bit different rules than Orlando and California parks. "
2466,2,N/A,Pakistan,Suggestion to management,"I visited on sat in nov , took starlight passport. A mob of people inside the park, could hardly walk through the crowd, getting chance to ride any attraraction a far cry!! Fast passes long sold out till 10pm could hardly take 3 rides with more than 2hrs in queue each.- why us Disney over selling tickets knowing that parks are extremely over crowded and cannot accommodate any more? - why the full ticket charged to customer who only gets a disappointment to wander for a place to stand even forget about riding any attraction? - you should reduce entry fee and put tickets on attractions where first come first can buy ticket and enjoy attractions, at least people don't have regret that they paid huge entry fee and end up with sad face by not getting any attraction!!- close down ticket windows once park is full to capacity. Do not sell in greed by letting in people in thousands where there is chaos and stampede in park and people running over each other.- with the park tickets hand over fast pass to guests with time the attraction can be visited thus no wild chase of people once park gate opens and people nearly stumble on each other in rush to fetch fast pass!!- in early 1980s the tickets were far too organised as Disney sold a booklet with pass for each ride in park and all visitors can use a ride once only and all guest would get chance to ride all attractions. The booklet comprised of entry fee plus rides charges for all attractions. Much better than current wild goose chase!- Disney is world class name brand, specially Japan is world most disciplined and organised nation, please don't spoil the image of this country. Do not give bad impression to the world. Appreciate your consideration.  Thanks ."
2467,4,15-Feb,Australia,Family with small kids,Good day but we had to miss most rides as lines were way to long. Also don't like that fact you have to go into a lottery to watch some shows. You should be able to pre-book. Also characters did not come out much. Didn't see Micky or the main ones at all.
2468,5,14-Nov,N/A,Very fun trip.,"Awesome trip for the family, a lot like Disneyland and Disneyworld in the states, but there are some different rides there also. i would highly recommend it if it is an option. If you are going to go I would also recommend Tokyo Disney Sea, as it is also very fun and different from anything we have at home."
2469,5,14-Mar,Japan,Fantastic Theme Park,"I went there in December, 2009.You can get the tickets from any Disney Store. So, there is no need to stand in a queue at the entrance to get it. Once you enter, what is to be done at first is to collect the fast passes of the rides you want to try on priority basis. It can save your time waiting in those long long queues. Be sure to keep a time to watch the parade. It is extremely wonderful. Do not miss it at any cost. Splash mountain, sky mountain are the most recommended rides. Do not miss :) You can take the pictures with cartoon characters such as Micky and minnie mouse, donald duck. Regarding food, the food court is always crowded, hence, you can go out once, and have your food in mcdonald located immediately outside of the park. Get a stamp on your hand in order to re-enter in the park and enjoy your day. Parade at night is also a very good. Keep 10-12 hours in your hand to enjoy the park well. Even though, you'll not be able to cover all the rides. But, decide which rides you want to try, and get the fast passes of them immediately once you enter the park."
2470,3,14-Dec,Japan,"Good, not great.","If you love Disney Parks, it's definitely a must see. It's very crowded there, especially on the weekends. Get there early to purchase tickets or buy online. We went Fri-Sun and Sunday was the worst. Expect to stand in line for HOURS if you don't have fast passes. And map out the attractions you want to get on so you're sure to get a fast pass for those as early as you can. Even the food places had lines that took forever. I recommend buying a popcorn buddy and getting refills all day for snacks (was the best purchase we made and the different favors of popcorn are so yummy). We went mid Dec. so it was freezing cold there. Be sure to bundle up. It was in the low to mid 40's and the humidity makes it tons colder. Check the forecast for rain also. My 10yr old loved it though and our 19yr old was happy to just experience it as were we but, once was enough for us."
2471,1,N/A,Australia,Worst place on earth,"Went there today coast of entry for family around AUD320, probably another spend of around $50 for drinks and food. The food is disgustingly atrocious.Basically the joint is a dump rides are rubbish our kids aged 13-17 thought it was a joke. Today was a Thursday about 0 degrees and a mixture of rain and snow. Regardless of what appeared to be very small crowds there queues were between 80-110 minutes are you kidding me. Based on this the place would come to a total standstill on a weekend, summer holiday etc. It should be call Queueland - that is all that exists there. Something as simple as getting popcorn 15+ minutes - really?????If you don't speak Japanese then you are wasting your time - nothing in shows etc is in English, NOTHING. So you queue forever to get into a ten minute show and sit there list wing to Japanese for the entire time. Now I appreciate it is Disney Tokyo but It portrays itself as an international tourist attraction and FYI no one else in the world speaks Japanese! I could go on but ow would really be repetitive. So to finalise if you are non-Japanese, don't want to waste money, don't want to queue all day for everything don't want crap food (do you want fried or deep fried) then simply solved - DON'T EVER GO TO THIS JOINT"
2472,5,15-Jan,Taiwan,dream resort!,"it's the second visit of disneysea, i enjoyed this place and was surprised by their performance!!! if you have chance to go to Tokyo, please save one to two days to visit here."
2473,4,N/A,United Kingdom,Super fun but overcrowded!,"We loved Tokyo Disneyland but found the queues for the attractions, rides and food and drink stands and restaurants to be ridiculous. On a Thursday in January too! Our impatience was probably not made easier due do the cold rainy wintry weather. However the rides were very impressive and advanced compared with Florida and Paris. A very clean and well organised park with happy and helpful staff. We found the entry price to be fair too. "
2474,3,15-Jan,Malaysia,Too crowded,"There are many interesting parks to play, but the queue is just unbearable...Don't forget to get the fast pass. It will save you some time."
2475,5,14-Oct,Australia,It's good to be a kid again!,"Well, I just went here for my kids! Wow! It seems I enjoyed as how they enjoyed the place and activities! üòÅüòäüòä (first family trip in asia was funfilled!)"
2476,2,N/A,N/A,Disappointed ,"My expectations were too high. Firstly let's begin with buying tickets they wouldn't except any foreign cards ANYWHERE Couldn't even pay eftpos, we had to leave Disneyland to go and get money out. (Might I add that most stores in Tokyo allow foreign cards to pay eftpos so i don't know why Disneyland wouldn't, it's a tourist attraction)Then our locker broke and had to pay 300yen to re open it, twice.main attractions were not open (aka haunted mansion :( ) All shows were in Japanese and most people didn't speak english.We went on a Monday and it was Way too crowded couldn't even walk And 2.5 hour waiting times for rides....Everything had a line!!!!!! "
2477,5,15-Jan,Indonesia,Excellent Park,"We arrive early at Tokyo Disney Land, around 1/2 hour before opening time. So you can avoid long entrance que. And please buy ticket online, you don't have to que for buying entrance ticket, and go straight to entrance que.It's crowded (but it's expected). Please avoid school holiday and Friday to Sunday.Prepare what kind of ride that you really want to see, you can't see everything in 1 day. Get FastPass 1st, especially the ride that you really want. At best, you can have 3-4 FastPass, so choose wisely.Back to the park, it's a beautifull park. Every attraction area is well crafted. Not as good as Tokyo Disney Sea, but it's still beautifull.The rides itself is more suitable for kid than for a teenager (most of thrilling riders only require 102 cm of heights). But my kid enjoyed very much. Their favourite are Star Tours, Monster Inc, and Pirates Of Caribean. For Star Tour, every departure gate, has different kind of story, so please take different gate, if you choose to ride again.Not just the rides, but the restaurant is well crafted too, and it's thematic. We have lunch at Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall restaurant, and it has a wonderfull ambience, inline with the thematic area.About the show, don't miss the Minie Oh Minie show and Once Upon A Time Show, especially The Once Upon A Time show. So they make a projection mapping of Disney movie with the castle as their canvas. Try your luck to get the lottery for the show (middle viewing seat).We got lucky to witness Frozen parade at this time.And don't forget to have Disney Resort snack. I have (definitely) mickey pork bun, pop corn, smokey turkey leg. And it's all delicious :DYou can reach this attraction via JR Keiyo/Musashino line, and stop at Maihama station."
2478,3,15-Jan,Australia,Interesting Experience,"Our first visit to a Disneyland was Tokyo on a Sunday afternoon/evening on a beautiful winters day.  The website had predicted a mildy busy day.  The place was packed with people and there was a waiting time over more than 2 hours for most of the rides.  There were no ""fast passes"" left so we had to join the standby queues for all rides.  There was even a long line to take a photo in front of the ""frozen"" shrine just inside the entrance to the park and there were lengthy queues for food.  Some of the rides were closed but we managed to have two rides in our time at the park.  We tried to view one of the shows but were informed on arrival at the entrance that you could only enter if you had entered and won a lottery for the ticket earlier in the day (sad face).  Our expectations moved from a ride based experience to just soaking up the disney atmosphere and observing the wonderful intersection of American and Japanese culture.  This was an excellent experience and worth the visit almost alone.  Despite the crowds, the park was immaculate and all of the staff were very friendly, well trained and composed.  The light show with the castle backdrop and the light parade were both simply stunning.  Most of the announcements and shows are in Japanese but this added to the attraction of the place as it was part of the local charm.  Definitely worth a visit but you have to go with the expectation of being part of a large crowd and chill out and enjoy the experience.  If rides are your primary motivation, would suggest visiting theme parks in other places such as Kuala Lumpur, Gold Coast or California."
2479,3,14-Dec,Australia,"If you don't understand Japanese, stay away","In case you don't know, all the programs and audio-visual attractions are in Japanese.  The Fast-Pass is a good concept but you feel you don't get your money's worth because you don't get to ride on the major attractions"
2480,4,15-Jan,Australia,Take a couple of credit cards,"We found that they would not accept our prepaid Travellex Mastercard, but would accept Visa card. Avoid going there on Public Holidays in Japan"
2481,5,14-May,Malaysia,Great fun for the family!,"We had a 2 year old in our group so our activities were mainly suited to his needs.  The queues were not that bad and we enjoyed 'A Small World' plus the train and car rides.  Some of the shows that we thought only had 'Mickey Mouse and friends' actually incorporated some scary ghostly scenes (only in Tokyo Disneyland!) and that was frightening for the toddler. Nevertheless, we had lots of fun... we enjoyed the light parade at the end of the day.  I would have preferred a better selection of food around the park so would advice families with toddlers to bring some snacks just in case you can't find anything suitable for your little ones.  Loved the shops...would have enjoyed spending a little more time shopping here especially in the sweets/biscuit shop."
2482,5,15-Jan,Australia,Great Family Day,"Been to Disneyland in LA and Disneyworld in Miami so decided to visit this one in Tokyo.  Just like the others and it was very friendly.  Shame ""A Small World"", ""Haunted Mansion"" and ""Log Flume"" the three rides I wanted my wife to try were not working.  However, we managed to go on the many other rides and the longest wait was 40 minutes.  (We didn't even bother about fast passes). Saw both parades - Main street and Electrical and they were both magnificent.  Easy access to the park via train so our day was jam-packed fun.  Only disappointment - Could not buy a Tokyo Disneyland Cap of T Shirt or Pull-Over - everything is generic.  Worst part, many items made in china!"
2483,5,15-Jan,Australia,Disneyland with the wait,"We want on a Saturday and couldn't believe the long waits, definitely worth going on a weekday if at all possible. As We arrived 30 minutes after it had opened and the wait for some of the lines where over 2 hours. We then decided to get a fast pass straight away and could only get it for 12. Once we did that ride we could only get one more fast pass as most of them had been taken. So in the space of 8 hors when we managed to get on 4 rides. Even the lines for meals, snacks or toilets was for around 30 minutes. Apart from the waiting it is exactly what you expect from Disney. All the rides though are in Japanese but we expected that so it didn't ruin our time as we kinda got the idea of what was going on. All the food at the park is pretty reasonably priced as well as all he souvenirs but definitely worth buying these as you go as towards the end you couldn't even get into the shops due to the crowds."
2484,4,14-Dec,Australia,Good replica of attractions but disappointing fireworks,"All the attractions were exact copies of the Disneys in USA, and in fact better than HK and Euro. 95% visitors are Japs so most announcements were in Jap. To max rides in a day as some rides were 45-90 mins wait in Q, use the Fast Pass to bypass long wait. Must try the various flavour pop corns. We were tired and cold by about 5pm but stayed and waited for the fireworks in freezing temp. What a letdown! The fireworks were the worst I have ever seen in my life. It was over in 2 minutes and they were extremely lousy fireworks! Absolutely felt cheated and wasted 3 hrs waiting in freezing weather!"
2485,5,14-Feb,Australia,Disney Is The Definition Of Happiness,"One of my favourite places to visit when I go to Japan, I have now been twice and it just gets better! There is very long queues but they are worth it. Staff are incredibly helpful if you do not speak Japanese, they try their hardest to communicate with you in your first language. Other people (visitors) in the park are also more than happy to help if you are stuck or lost. The attractions are so much fun! I spent over 12 hours there on my last visit and wish I could have spent even more time! It is best if you pre-purchase your entry pass, or wait at least and hour to an hour and half after to park opens to buy your entry pass. Amazing shopping to be done as well, it is pricy but worth it! I recommend staying around for the parades and the fire works at night because they are so much fun to watch! I also love the caramel popcorn! Disney was one of the highlights of my exchange!"
2486,5,N/A,France,Must visiting ,I recommend this place for everyone who travelling to Japan no matter where you stay you have to visit this place because it has so much fun inside plus the place is very convenient to reach with any kind of transportation. But if you go in the peak seasons you have to prepare with the long queing in most of the attraction. Be sure to buy the tickets before in the disney store around Tokyo or Yokohama to avoids long queing in the ticketing counter. Pack some light snacks and reusable drinking bottled to save because free drinking tap is available around the place. 
2487,5,N/A,Indonesia,Amazing place,"If you got a small children or loves disney characters, this is the place you don't wanna miss. When I got there, there's a Frozen parade. Elsa, Anna and Olaf did a parade and stopped a few times to sing Frozen song. Happiness is Here parade is not an event to be missed. Beside that, there's a parade at night that shows LED shaped like disney characters. At night, full fireworks only on weekends. On weekdays, there's a story telling in a Cinderella castle that (still) got fireworks. So be sure to take the parade and fireworks brochure because it's different with the guide map one. Oh and Haunted Mansion was closed for good."
2488,5,15-Jan,Singapore,Happiest place on earth,"It was fun but the queues were not despite the fact that we were there on a Tues and Wed. Even buying popcorn, we had to queue. Everything was in Japanese, which makes me wonder if this was built to cater for local tourism. Not so convenient for those of us who cannot understand the language. The churro was fantastic. "
2489,4,15-Jan,Australia,Surprisingly satisfying,"All in all, not too shabby. I am generally anti-consumerism (humbug, I know) but Tokyo Disneyland was surprisingly satisfying. We got there at 9am - gates open at 10am. Did about 5 rides and walked a lot. Worked out the fastpass (you can only have 1 active until your time window for the attraction opens, then you can get another). The parade is pretty good (for the kids at least). Pirates of the Caribbean excellent, as was Big Thunder Mountain and Star Tours. Space Mountain was a bit of a challenge for old folk. Watching the Japanese kids in weird clothes was also interesting. So strange. Don't miss the soy sauce and butter popcorn - that's a good one."
2490,4,15-Jan,Indonesia,The Disney Sea ... great place to visit for fun and family ...,"Great place to visit for family and to have fun ... I prefer the Disney Sea rather than Disneyland as Disney sea is more for adults ...  Tower of Terror, Stormrider, Journey to Centre of the World are some attractions to visit .... great."
2491,2,N/A,Australia,Definately the worst disneyland I have visited,"Visited mid week (tuesday) to avoid crowds and could mot believe the floods of people. Wait times are up to two hours for rides and a lot of them were shut the day we went. We started with haunted mansion - shut, critter country log ride - closed, its a small world - closed, pirates of the Caribbean - closed, winnie the poo ride - closed... I was close to doing a clark griswald when they opened pirates of the Caribbean in the last two hours. Went on this twice and star tours twice and not much else. The kids rides that in los angeles or hong kong are straight on are about a 30 min to 1 hour wait. There were other rides that I had never been on but they took too long 2 hours so we did not go. Very disappointing."
2492,1,14-Dec,United States,Wow what a disappointment,"I stayed at Ambassador Hotel, that just needs its own poor review. The park staff is less than helpful if you are an American, It seems like they have 2 sets of rules 1 set if you are Japanese and another if you are not. As I entered into the park I was told they did not allow Monopoles into Tokyo Disney. I was told I had to rent a locker to store my Monopole. I lost the early time provided to Disney hotel guests. Later I photographed 13 Japanese people using monopoles during the parade. Another issue Tokyo Disney requires you to sit on the ground to view the parade. Sorry I do not sit on the ground. They should have an area designated to stand and view the parade."
2493,1,14-Aug,Philippines,My least favorite Disneyland,"I have been to a number of disneys in Florida, California, Paris, Hong Kong and this one in Tokyo was definitely my least favorite. The ride selection was not very impressive and you had to stand in line for way too long compared to other countries. The fast track tickets sell out immediately and you are going to have to queue up for 3 hours to take a 2 minute ride. Unlike the one in Florida, this Disney is relatively small and does not have much to do.  It was just a major yawn fest (even for my daughter who is still young enough to appreciate parks). We only stayed a few hours and found it much more interesting to visit other sights in Tokyo."
2494,5,14-Nov,United Kingdom,AMAZING,"My boyfriend and I loved Disneyland in Tokyo! Having previously only been to Paris, I was expecting so much and it did not disappoint! Fantastic rides and huge choice of restaurants. Fortunately we were lucky with the weather and it didn't rain at all, in fact it was lovely warm! We used the fast entrance booking for all the major rides which was brilliant! I love Disney and I would definitely recommend you come here - with or without kids!!"
2495,5,14-Oct,Indonesia,Because dreams do come true ;),"This is my very first Disneyland experience, and I am glad that I did it in Tokyo Disneyland. The place was crowded, as expected (it was Thursday!) and bustling with excitement. On my visit it was cloudy but not rainy, a perfect weather for running round trying to secure fast past. I did arrive at 10 am and boy it was already full! I should have arrived much, much earlier to be able to hop on most rides. Due to the crazy queue (and I was already saved by some fast pass I managed to get), I only got the chance to try 75% of the rides - and I stayed until the last minutes before closing time.Since I visited on October, all of the park was decorated with meticulous, beautiful detailed Halloween decoration and they had a special Halloween parade (worth the waiting). Aside of the rides, the parades and shows were one of the 'obligatory' things to see. The Halloween parade, the daytime parade 'happiness is here', the night electrical parade 'dreamlands', and of course, the bedazzling 'once upon a time' show... they were all awesome!I'll sure be back!"
2496,5,14-Dec,Malaysia,Never Dissapointed,My third trip here and Disneyland Tokyo has never disappoint me all this time. The rides were all well maintained but some might look a little aged but still enjoy riding them. I can never leave the park without having my roast turkey leg.
2497,4,14-Dec,Malaysia,Its a place where dreams come true,"Nice place, during our visit, it was cold but it was sunny. The park was very big but since it is opened at 8am and only closed at 10pm, surely you can try at least 80% of the rides and attractions.For those who are travelling with babies/infants, you do not have to worry at all, there is actually a very spacious baby room which have all the breastfeeding rooms, diapers changing stations and all the necessities when it comes to babies/kids. You can even rent a stroller if you wish to. Rides/attractions - The queue was long but you can always use a fastpass (basically a special pass which allows you to be on a fast lane - it is not sold separately and it is part of your ticket, just that you are allowed to be on a ride using fast pass, you might not be able to be on a ride with fast pass on other rides within the same period of time; cool? save your time?)Shops - Amazing... that's all I can say because the shops sell lots and various stuffs from tea pot, to jackets to postcards and etc. All is exclusively designed for Tokyo Disney Resort and you will not be able to find it anywhere else in the world.Food/Restaurants - good value and lots of choices. Quality of the food was good.Access - easy to reach by JR via Maihama Station (via Keiyo Line) and the park is just 5 minutes away from the station.Overall - its a must visit attraction if you visiti Tokyo!!"
2498,4,14-Dec,China,Another year another Disneyland,"It might be the city, with some 18 million citizens, but Tokyo Disneyland seams bigger & busier than other Disneylands.My 1st day was rainy, which meant the park was a little quieter with wait times of about an hour for popular attractions.But queuing was still in the dry.There was better weather on my 2nd day, while this did affect some shows & parades they where still the high quality you expect from Disney.The new Star Tours, given the random sequences of Tower of Terror, has improved the experience. Also the new theme appears to be ready for the new movies.If you've done Disney around the world then this is a must as Japanese service & Disney enterainment complement each other fr a great time."
2499,1,14-Dec,Japan,"price-gouging, congestion...and poor service?!","Price-gouging and congestion I was expecting...but officious, unfriendly staff and poor service I could have done without having just paid 6800 to get in, especially as the only ride I was really interested in was closed -Thunder Mtn - was closed. Of course there was no money back...What summed it up for me was having to line up for 40mins to ""meet Minnie,"" then to be told that we could only take ONE photo!! Also, even though a few of the staff are trying hard to speak English, most of them have given up on the Gaijin apart from when they can find some reason to tell you off such as for carrying my daughter, doing up the seatbelt wrong etc.Avoid this place if at all possible."
2500,5,15-Jan,Philippines,The Happiest Place in Japan,"Again, I am brought back to my childhood... Disney will always be Disney. It will forever tug at my heart. Arrived at 8AM, the lines were long to get in but it moved pretty quickly. Tip, do not ever do Tomorrowland first but make sure to get FastPasses for the rides that you wanna ride there. If you wanna go on the Winnie the Pooh ride, upon entering, go there directly and get a FastPass. Even the FastPass ticketing line gets long. Of course, do not miss It's A Small World. We went during thw winter holiday so the song was mashed-up with Jingle Bells in different languages. Even the Haunted Mansion was Christmas themed, based on The Nightmare Before Christmas. The Big Thunder Mountain ride line also gets long... so get a Fast pass there too. Don't miss the shows! The One Man's Dream show is pretty spectacular but it's tickets you get from a lottery. So if you wanna make sure you get to watch, do the very first show but make sure you come way ahead of start time. We went there 30mins before and it was already full. If you want to watch the other times, you can go to the lottery area and get a ticket. You can also get a ticket for the Once Upon a Time show there for the best view seats. Also, don't miss the PhilHarMagic ride in Fantasy Land and the parades. Still the Happiest Place on Earth!"
2501,5,14-Feb,Malaysia,Truly Magical Land for Asians,Tokyo Disneyland is far better and bigger than HK Disneyland. I would truly recommend for Asians within this region to visit Tokyo Disneyland. Its so huge and I love the Sea World. Full of fun but please check the weather before booking your ticket.
2502,3,N/A,Ireland,It's Disneyland so it's fun but I preferred Eurodisney,"We arrived here late morning and the queues were insane! The park is relatively small and as much as it's fun the queues ruined it! We were queuing for the splash mountain for over 2hrs it was meeental! Eurodisney was way bigger and less queues! We did however notice these guides that would bring family's around, I would look into that if I was ever going again as they seemed to get all fastpasses for you!"
2503,5,15-Jan,United States,A little taste of America with some twists,"We attended on one of the busiest days of the year (New Year's Day). While the lines were long and the park was crowded, the attraction lines are well managed and the Japanese crowd was very respectful.  The old FastPass system is still employed so coordinating our ride times meant we were able to still ride everything we wanted to in one day.  One interesting thing to try that is very popular are the various types of popcorn available throughout the park.  From Soy Sauce and Butter to Curry flavored (I don't recommend the latter) there are about 8 different flavors at various stands around the park with different collector's buckets. Something fun to try while walking around or waiting in line."
2504,4,14-Dec,Philippines,Christmas in Tokyo Disneyland,"I noticed that there were more teenagers and adults than kids. I think the Japanese really love Disneyland. The park was so full, luckily we were given a guest pass."
2505,5,N/A,China,Happiest  Day of Life,"This is my first over trip to Disneyland themed park in my entire life with my old friend living in japan first impression park is crazy busy and crowed , Japnese teens were dressed identically in their own cliques and everyone from kids to adult had the little Disney merchandise on their head , Mickey mouse ears , headband , hats . It's easy to be wowed by the hustle and bustle of the Disney atmosphere !You need to understand Japnese to fully enjoy Disneyland experience . The park customer service people are so excellent in every small way, they are full of hospitable , smile and full of polite , greeting and they do go out of their way to help you out .They do have good English speaking staff to help you and guide you .The rides were fantastic specially once that had animatronics . Think world class Japnese robot plus Disney and you have it. The night parade was really nice , all the floats are made up to LED light it's really something special .Over all we had a great day , took lot of beautiful pictures , I would recommend to visit all Disney fans . Would be great place to take the Kids ."
2506,5,14-Dec,Singapore,"Funtastic Disneyland, Tokyo","We have a great day in Disneyland. My kids are 11 and 6.  We went on a Friday , 2nd week Dec.The Avg normal wait is about 25 plus minutes.  We had the shorteste Q for 5mins, very lucky! We managed to watch STAR WARs 4 D  TWICE !   It was two different movies from the left and right cinema.  Try to get two shows if you can.Yes, the park is very crowded, think it is even more crowded on Sat and Sun. But Jap are very polite and not rowdy, so you will not exp ""jumping Q""  scene or loud yells etcI did my homework  before park visit, plan the types of rides I am interested. In the end we manage to take abt 90% ride in a day from 9.30 am to 8.30pmMy longest Q was Monster Inc - did not manage to get FASTPAss for this ride, Q was abt 45min  after 7.30pm cos most people rush to watch the night parade Go in Dec, there are a lot of parades which you can catch on and off while in Q.The food is reasonably priced , with a reasonable taste, we went for pizza, burgers, breads etc with all the Disney characters shape, kids were happy to eat this.Leave the park early before closure time, the train station can be crowded too.Generally, do some research and rank the rides that is important to you. I did not catch any show because got to do on line booking, in Jap??   we enjoyed the rides like starwars, Haunted Mansion, Space Mountain , car driving , Monster Inc , Roger rabbit -haha, u try it u will know what I meant.Plan well and Enjoy - you must plan where you want to get your meals too cos different world serve diff theme of food :)"
2507,2,14-Dec,United States,Not worth it if you've visited Disneyland USA,"Was put-off that you needed to win a lottery to watch some shows.  I've always just fallen in line in the other parks to watch a show.  Well we obviously did not win the lottery hence my disappointment.I did not see any Disney photographer in the park.  I wanted to have a picture taken in front of the castle and had to ask a local to do it.  She didnt take a good picture with my wife's camera phone and cut off the top of the castle.  I actually brought a tripod but was advised at the entrance gate that I was not allowed to use it.  I think I missed a memo somewhere.We were going to line up to have a photo taken with Woody.  The cast member mentioned that their time was up and we couldnt line up.    I assumed that the mascot was just going to go on break and a replacement would be soon coming over but I was still advised that I couldnt line up and to just try and come back later.  It was only 2pm by the way.  If you've gone to Orlando or Disney Hong Kong even, don't bother  to visit or if you must, lower your expectations."
2508,4,14-Dec,Singapore,Disneyland Brings The Kid In Us Out Again,"This is my first ever trip to a Disneyland themed park in my entire life, with my husband and 8 year old son. First impression, the park is crazy busy and crowded with 70% of their locals, but it could be very well that I went during their holiday/festive period. That being said, it's not entirely a bad thing as the Japanese teens were dressed identically in their own cliques and everyone from the kids to the adults, had a little Disney merchandise on their head (Mickey Mouse ears headbands, hats, the whole works). It's easy to be wowed by the hustle and bustle of the Disney atmosphere. Makes one, even the adults not mind buying a similar merchandise and walk around the park wearing them without feeling silly.I like that it had a good mix of the more current Disney Characters as well as the older Disney cartoons that I grew up watching. I enjoyed their 3D rides tremendously though the queue is horrifying at nearly 2 hours wait per ride inside.I suppose the plus point that they try to make it a little more bearable was their Fast-Pass System (FOC) which you probably will get perhaps 2 max for 2 different rides and at different timings, Basically, with your ticket, you could go to the Fast Pass Kiosk at e.g.  2pm in front of the ride, and get the next Fast Pass for the next designated timing e.g. 4pm-5pm. After which, you could only get the next Fast Pass for another ride perhaps 2-3 hours later after your first fast-pass collection.I was at Disneyland from 11am till 10pm and probably had only gone on 3 different 3D rides/shows, experienced their Illuminated Night Parade (which was simply amazing) as well as watched their Cinderella Castle animation in the evening (outdoors). I thoroughly the Cinderella Castle, not just because of the princess themed animations, but the oh-so familiar songs accompanying them. It brought back lovely memories of my childhood and I found myself singing along softly with the songs. You need not understand Japanese to fully enjoy the Disneyland experience. The Park customer service people are so excellent in every small ways. They are full of smiles and full of polite greetings and they do go out of their way to help you out. They do have good English Speaking Staff (of course do not expect full-fledged English, but it's good enough for communication of information) who are on hand to help you.If I could and had known better, I would set aside 2 days per themed park to fully explore their other rides/shows and also stay at their Disney Resort to minimize my travelling time to and fro."
2509,5,14-Jun,Vietnam,Magic Paradise,No matter adult or child will love this place.goo maner and kindly staff here. my family vist here one year one time. If you really want play fun and enjoy all facilities. i suggest you at least need one day passoort and one after six.
2510,5,14-Dec,Singapore,Worth the Experience for Those Who Enjoy Disney and People,"I've been to the Parks in US several times and this park is much smaller. So if you are coming and expect the Park to match the US, you are in for disappointment. That said, I loved this park and would do it again. The Japanese and visiting Asian tourists know how to have fun. Lots of groups of kids (mostly girl teens) all dressed identically, laughing and having fun. I felt like the crowd was a little older than the US but very fun to be around, well behaved and courteous. Just understand the Park is smaller and the Disney Stores are not as well stocked.  Oh, and lastly take the subway, the stop is right at the entrance. "
2511,4,14-Nov,Singapore,Colourful and busy but always fun,"To be honest, my wife and I would rather not visit a theme park if not for our kids.  But there's something about a Disney theme park that appeals to both children and adults.  Maybe it's the easy familiarity with the themes and characters you encounter there, maybe it's the shows and parades, it could also be the rides, and goodness knows the staff keep the park clean.  And visiting during the Christmas season, the park always looks that extra bit special.  In any case, it's good family fun for young and old.  It is very popular, so a 'slow' day (Mondays to Wednesdays) still means crowds and having to queue at popular rides.  This is where the Disney Fastpass system really comes into its own.  Regardless of going solo or in a group, it helps immensely to have a plan that maps out which attractions to visit and when.The park grounds are about an hour away from Tokyo.  We caught the complimentary coach from our accommodation (a Disney Good Neighbour Hotel) in Shinjuku which was very convenient but only got us there an hour after the park opened.  Another thing we discovered was that young children rarely have the stamina to last an entire day at the park.  So if at all possible, it would be better to be staying at one of the Disney hotels or a partner hotel close by.     That way, the kids could get back to the hotel for a few hours' rest before returning to the park for the evening activities."
2512,4,14-May,N/A,Great Disney Day Trip,"I went by myself to Tokyo Disneyland and despite not 'throwing' myself into the action, I thoroughly enjoyed myself.I went by myself and for that reason I didn't really go on many of the rides - I got to the park quite late in the day (2pm) and by that time all of the fast-track options were gone and not many rides had a 'solo rider' option which I would have opted for. The biggest con of the Tokyo Disney is that the queues are quite long, I went in May on a weekday - there were a lot of kids who had obviously gone after school as they were still in uniform, so I would suggest going early to avoid the rush of school kids. What I really loved about Tokyo Disney were the parades and entertainment like shops, cast members, the castle, the shows etc. Worth the money for any disney fan."
2513,3,14-Jul,N/A,Not worth the money,"If you have travelled to the US parkts, this park is not really worth it. The only good thing is that there are different areas which you do not find in the usual parks. Its really crowded on the weekends as usual. Prices for food are ok. Attactions are ok but not really exciting."
2514,2,14-Dec,N/A,Was ok but.... Horrible scenes,"I went to Tokyo Disneyland last night for the New Years Eve event. First off as I'm foreign tickets had sold out very early in year however managed to get some last minute at a very high price through hoes party site. Overall we had fun (aged in our 30's) viewing the parade and eventually the fireworks plus managing 3 rides given the lineup times averaged 1.5 to 2.5 hours each.I was well prepared for what would be intense crowds but my main reason for writing this review and my first ever here on T.A was the appalling scenes in the parks dining and food facilities. Being an over night event people get tired and for whatever reason decided that once they had a table in a restaurant or the caf√©s... They would set camp and simply go to sleep meanwhile many, MANY more people had to sit on the floor to have a snack. Staff walked around smiling and clearing trays from the floor and some tables but did nothing to move those that had simply come in to sleep on tables or settled well after their meal. I was amazed to see family's with small children or prams, some elderly aged or people in wheelchairs and everyone between troll the areas like vultures looking for a wall or part of a walkway to find a place to eat. Watching mothers struggle or a man in a wheelchair eating next to a bin as he couldn't get a table while others slept pretty much ruined my night and sadly will be the defining memory I will take from my first trip to a Disneyland.Understanding the huge volume of people present would be hard to manage there was no sign at all of a strategy or operating procedure for this. please implement a stronger policy of once meal done in a timely manor.... Move on so others like myself don't need to feel like I'm in a refuge centre sipping tea huddled in a corner."
2515,4,14-Jun,United States,A Must-See for Disneyland Fans,"If you are a Disneyland fan, and happen to be in Japan, then you must take a trip to this Magic Kingdom.  The subway/train takes you right to the gate, so you don't have to worrying about parking which is significantly different than DL in California.  Once inside, you will find a cleaner and happier place on earth, if you can believe that.  We all know that Disney parks are clean, but this one takes the cake!  And people are so respectful, particularly those waiting to watch the parades. They even have bench seating for a few hundred people in front of Cinderella's castle, and the seats are given away by lottery. It's so organized that you really think ""this must be fantasyland!"" The Disneyland park is much smaller and compact than those in the US, but all the cool rides are there. It's definitely worth the trip."
2516,5,14-Dec,Singapore,Beautiful place,"We enjoyed ourselves very much and actually preferred Disneyland to Disney Sea, unlike most others. We've been to Disney in California which we preferred. The language was not a barrier in Disney Tokyo, but it did make it less immersive an experience and this was slightly disappointing for my son. The Japanese guests are a delight to wait in line with and hence the crowds did not cause us any stress it otherwise would have in any other nation. Meals were less expensive than I expected and we enjoyed all our meals."
2517,5,N/A,Italy,An adult's childhood visions come alive,"A must for all those who grew up with Disney movies.After reading mixed reviews, I wasn't sure whether this would be worth it, but I'm glad I did. All my childhood movie experiences were brought to life. No point visiting if you don't like queues. We arrived at 9am and averaged a 30 min wait for the first couple of rides and 60 mins for the rest of the day. I took a book with me and managed to read the whole thing whilst waiting. Had I not had the book, I would have got annoyed.Not speaking Japanese didn't really matter, but can't wait to go to the U.S. Disneyland in the future where I'll understand everything that is said.Well worth a day trip."
2518,3,14-Dec,Australia,Disneysea better with young children,"We had been to Disneyland Tokyo before and quite enjoyed it. This time we took our young son (2 years) - which could have been our mistake! There aren't a huge amount of rides/attractions suitable to really little ones and the wait times are quite bad (some were over 2 hours). The queues for the food are just as bad. Definitely don't go on a weekend or holiday if you can help it, and take your own food and snacks. The food is expensive and pretty bad (as you'd probably expect at these places). We had a 2 day pass, so went to DisneySea the following day and had a much better experience. We had a pram and didn't have any issues with parking it with the others when we were on a ride etc."
2519,5,14-Nov,New Zealand,Disney - not for thrill seekers!,"First of all - this is for Disney fans.  Don't go to this theme park for the rides if you're not in to Disney.  This park is more about the Disney experience and the rides are pretty tame with massive queues.That being said we spent a full day here, staying until closing.  We visited on a Monday - apparently the best days are Tuesday/Wednesday.  We went on about 7 rides -the longest queue was for 2 hours and 10 minutes, so be prepared to wait.  We saw heaps of people playing on their Nintendo DS while waiting in queue - wish I'd taken mine!  If you have one, take it.  The parades were awesome - a must watch, especially the night lights parade.  The shopping was really good and I didn't find the food/shopping to be overly expensive.  Almost everyone has the collectible popcorn containers and walks around filling them up at the different flavour carts.  We were pretty tame with our flavours (caramel/butter and salt) but they had some cool choices (chocolate, curry etc).  The rides are good, but pretty cutesy and not for thrill seekers (given away by all the small children waiting in line).  I would recommend getting to the park early and racing straight for a fast pass machine for a popular ride before you begin queueing in line for another ride.  Make sure you check your fast pass ticket as it tells you what time you will ride AS WELL AS what time you can pick up another fast pass ticket for another ride.  The fast pass machines are outside the rides, close to the queue entrance.  It doesn't cost for a fast pass but you can only get 1 every 60-90 minutes (or something like that) so make sure you check what time you are eligible to pick up another one for a different ride.  If you are clever you can easily fast pass 3-4 rides - you just have to start early.  Popular rides seemed to be splash mountain, space mountain, the toy story and winnie the pooh rides etc.Overall we had a great day and I would recommend a visit to all Disney fans!  Would be a great place to take the kids."
2520,5,14-Dec,N/A,Time with my toddler,"The rides and parade did not disappoint. Expensive to stay in japan overall, specially Tokyo, but was really worth it. Ive been here 2002, 2005, 2008 and two weeks ago. I will definitely be back again. "
2521,4,14-Dec,Singapore,A good day out for the family,"A good day out for the family, but be prepared to queue for 1 ‚Äì 2 hrs. for each attraction. Everything is in Japanese, so you might not know what Mickey is trying to tell you. But Japanese maintain their order & discipline , no commotion. Nice Christmas deco , be sure to catch the fireworks at night."
2522,3,N/A,Australia,Busier than a shopping mall on Christmas Eve!,"Let's start off first by saying it's Disneyland - of course it's amazing and it's magical and all the other adjectives you can think of that could possibly go with that. It's also super busy. I know a lot of people have said that you can't complain about the lines and that's what you should expect, but this went above and beyond my expectations (and previous experiences at Disney parks). We went on two rides because that's all we had the willpower to wait for. We waited an hour for each of those. There were some bigger/newer rides I would have liked to go on but the wait time was like two hours and I just don't have the fitness level to stand up in line that long, not gonna lie! Get there really early if you want a fast pass because by the time we got to the park and got our bearings it was about 11am and they had stopped all the fast passes. The wait for meals at two different places was about 20 minutes and we waited 15 minutes for popcorn, about 20 for souvenirs - just to give you a rough idea of what it was like. The crowds are something to marvel at all on their own, it's like rush hour in the subway but everywhere all the time, I've never seen so many people before. In saying all this the park is very well maintained, everything is perfectly tidy and obviously every disney park is a little different so it is worth seeing. It's also worth noting that the entry is the cheapest I believe of any Disney park in the world. The cashier at the gate wouldn't accept my Visa debit as payment for some reason, luckily my mum who I went with had her card because I wasn't carrying enough cash. I've never had it turned away before so I'm not sure why that was, so maybe take enough cash for tickets with you just to be safe.The night parade was really nice, all the floats are made up of LED lights, it's really something special.If you're in Tokyo and you have a spare day or you really like Disney then yeah, give it a visit, but I wouldn't go to Tokyo specifically to visit Disneyland. You're much better off going to Hong Kong for a Disneyland specific trip as theirs is smaller, but much less busy. There's minimal wait for rides there, we went on a weekday and didn't wait longer than 15 minutes for anything and never really waited for food. "
2523,5,14-Dec,N/A,When will I get tired of visting this place? √ú,"Been here countless times. The attractions are well placed between each other, sequentially - for the rides that we love.The crew are friendly and approachable.Looking forward to the next return - It's A Small World üëçüáØüáµüëç"
2524,3,14-Dec,Australia,So over rated Disneyland fireworks!,"Just did a day trip to the much hyped Tokyo Disneyland. Left the Tokyo Dome hotel at 8.30am and was at the entrance by 9am using the highway. The crowd is 99% Japanese and thus all announcements except the daily specials (fireworks, lights, parades) had some English. The Japanese are such disciplined and patient people. They come with their mats and rugs and would sit on the road/floor for various parades 2-3 hours ahead. The usual street parades are copies of parades from other Disneys. The lines for the popular rides were long, often over 70 minutes so knowing how to take advantage of the fast pass is essential to maximise number of rides. The Japanese staff/attendants' English must be improved, as the attendant's 70 minutes was heard as 17 minutes and hence a long wait for a Big Splash ride! All attractions were exact replicas except for the language. What is most disappointing was the fireworks at the end of the day starting at 8.30pm sharp and finishing at 8,33pm! Oh yes, I waited the whole day in freezing temperature to the biggest anti climax and disappointment of the fireworks! Please don't bother waiting and waste precious time in the cold and spending another 7000 Yens for taxi ride back to hotel."
2525,4,14-Dec,Singapore,Always the happiest place on earth,"The only reason I am not giving this place full marks is because in my 2 trips this year, It seems extremely a tall task to get a photo with Mickey's friends! The lottery ticket system to a couple of shows was also disappointing - of course I would not say that if I had been luckier. Perhaps it's just a park where you can get more out of it by spending more than a day or have breakfast with characters. My poor 4 year old was disappointed he could not get Minnie's autograph for his lil sis."
2526,5,14-Apr,N/A,Its a lot of fun and excitement,"The staff were very kind and helpful,it was enjoyable specially to my kids and wife.they love it.its so clean and you dont need to worry if you forget something ,or you left something behind they will return it back if they found it what a japanese way of attitude to visitors.its so magical you guys have to visit this place .thanks."
2527,3,14-Dec,Australia,Stressful,"Overcrowded and stressful. Only managed to take 3-4 rides as the queues were shocking. Fastpass not helping as you're only allowed to take 1 fastpass per 4 hours or after the one you have had passed. More interesting to watch the visitors, especially the locals, fully embraced the Disney culture by wearing Disney stuff. They didn't look out of place, the old and the youngsTo buy food or snacks or whatever, do expect queues. If you can bring your own the better especially if you have young ones. Pricewise similar to Australia, some can be more.After visiting Disneylands in US and Hongkong, they became similar and monotone. Disney Sea is more interesting for someone like me who had visited other countries Disneys"
2528,4,14-Nov,Australia,A great day out,"I have to be honest, I was skeptical about wasting a precious day in Tokyo at a theme park - but I was totally wrong, Disneyland was awesome.  Maybe it's just tapping into my childhood memories of watching Disney films etc, but there genuinely is something magical about the place.As others note, it is extraordinarily crowded, I went on a weekday and seeing a queue for a ride under an hour or so was rare - 2 and a half hour waits were not uncommon.  Fortunately I really wasn't attending for the rides.   Honestly I didn't find the prices that outragous, yes it's not cheap but it's not astronomical.My lasting memory will include how friendly, professional and accomodating the staff I dealt with were.  My partner was concerned she would not fit on many of the rides, and didn't want to wait for an hour to answer that question.  On numerous occasions she approached ride staff to ask, who despite not being all that good with English understood her, treated her with respect and actually took her to the front of the line to see if she'd fit in the rides safely before returning back to the line at an appropriate point if she did, or back to the exit if she did not.  I was very impressed.Only complaint?  There really weren't many toilets around the park!  I had to go looking for them often - and when found there were lines for the mens room."
2529,5,14-Dec,Australia,Its Disney and its awesome,"I was surprised how easy it was as a westerner to enjoy Tokyo Disneyland.  It is almost a carbon copy of Disneyland Anaheim.  The staff were very helpful and it was easy to get around with English maps and signs.  Getting to and from the park was a breeze and many nearby hotel offer shuttle services or you can get off at Maihama Station and walk less than 5 minutes from a direct walkway and you are there.  If you can get there, just go, it won't disappoint. "
2530,5,14-Jun,United States,LOVED IT!!,"We visited Tokyo Disneyland in mid June while the park was celebrating Spring. It was decorated with many egg shaped characters, which was very cute! It was not very crowded when we visited so it was very enjoyable even though it was very hot and humid. Everything was updated and very clean but the park is smaller than the one in FL. We thought it was a great idea that the park had the main street store area covered! It is a great place to go if it is raining or if you're in need of some shade. The store windows were decorated so beautifully it was fun just to go around and look at each one!"
2531,5,N/A,Australia,Just so magical,I love every bit of this place. I like the gift shops where I bought heaps of souvenirs for my friends that are worth your money. I would definitely come back! Hopefully soon!
2532,4,14-Dec,Indonesia,Beware!! you can forget that you are not kid anymore,"I'm 30 now and i don't care when i entered tokyo disneyland (most of people my age or older also), i bought donald duck hat and wear it for the whole day of my visit, even wear it on my way back to hotel. The parade 'Happiness is here' makes me forget everything and feel like when I was kid (feel like watching disney cartoon live!!!). Most of the rides are designed for kid, but  pirates of carribean and jungle cruise are interesting, you should try it. Don't forget to ask for english guide (if you don't speak japanese) at the ticket gate, they don't provide is unless you ask.. if only the characters speak english or at least they put english on the subtitile, I will give this park 5 stars."
2533,5,N/A,N/A,Fantastic!,"Tokyo Disneyland was fantastic in my opinion, compared to the theme parks we have in Australia, Disneyland was more exciting and even cheaper! I loved it! We went more to experience the atmosphere than the rides, however for the rides we did go on the line was only about 15 minutes, we went on a Friday evening :)"
2534,3,14-Nov,N/A,Overcrowded!,"My family and I visited Disneyland on a Sunday afternoon, and we stayed till night time. Yes you would have guessed it right - we took the Starlight passport, for entrance on weekend 3pm onwards. Upon entering the park, all we saw were long queues, and more long queues! Throughout the 6 hours spent, only managed to go on 3 rides, with an average waiting time of 45 minutes. Did not manage to get any express tickets as they were all given away by the time we reached the park. In fact I find that privilege annoying as when it is almost our turn for this Monsters Inc. ride, out of a sudden the crowd started flocking in the express lane thus prolonging our wait. In the end we wanted to see the fireworks and decided to leave the queue with only a handful people in front of us - we were THIS close!Having visited HK Disneyland before, we couldn't help but to notice that almost all the rides are the same, and it is definitely less crowded despite the smaller size of the park compared to the one in Tokyo.A miss-able attraction."
2535,5,14-Dec,Singapore,"Survivor: Disneyland (Outqueue, outspend, outlast)","So you want to visit Tokyo Disneyland, huh? Here's a handy guide to maximising your Tokyo Disneyland experience (by no means exhaustive, of course):Consider the following:1) Your group demographic (family with young kids/teens/elderly folk, couple on honeymoon, friends)2) Objective of your visit (complete ALL the rides/watch the shows/character meet & greet/souvenir shopping?)3) Do you have specific needs (meals e.g.vegetarian/halal)?4) Will you be staying near the resort, or out of town?5) Is the park part of your itinerary, or THE itinerary?Once you have established the answers to the questions above, go ahead and enjoy the park :) planning is key to a successful visit! Main points- Queues are expected. Plan your visit and set your expectations accordingly. About 10% of reviewers gave this place an average - poor rating, and almost of them all had to do with the crowds and intolerable queues. - it's Di$$$neyland. You will pay out of your nose for this and eat grass for the next few weeks/months, but the memories will linger on for a while. Disneyland is an EXPERIENCE, not just a run of the mill amusement park visit.--TDL is a beautiful park, filled mostly with locals. It's clean, organized and buzzing with excitement. It's also very big, and you would be hard pressed to do everything within a day or even two. Since we were staying at the Disneyland hotel, we were able to stay at the park from opening to closing, yet after 2 days, there were still several rides and shows that we did not go on/watch.On our Must-Do List - Monsters Inc Hide & Go Seek (riders get a flashlight, and you shine it on the Monsters' Inc logo on the helmets to reveal the hiding place of the monster. Tip: remember to look UP)- the night time parade, Electrical Parade Dreamlights- The Haunted Mansion, based on the Nightmare before Christmas- Star Tours (apparently good for repeated rides, as there are different versions!)- Once Upon A Time show (need to get lottery tickets for good seats, which I will explain in a mo')- Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters (our family favourite)- Lilo's Luau & FunOn our Give It A Miss list- Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin (although I loved the movie)- Snow White's Adventures (an old, outdated ride)- Pooh's Hunny Hunt (not sure what the hype is about..it's OK. Mystic Manor, which is a similar ride in HKDL trumps this one)Some shows are in Japanese only, so if you don't mind, you could go watch and enjoy the music. Their productions are of amazing quality and very entertaining.Pack a picnic mat (and blankets, if you are going in the cooler seasons) as people start claiming their spots for parades and shows early by laying down their mats. It's a great system because everyone gets a nice, unblocked view of the floats and performers. The mat and blanket also comes in useful when you watch an outdoor performance, as the benches can be c-c-c-coollldd. They even sell little foldable foam seat cushions for this purpose.TDL has a curious lottery system, where you go to a room filled with little machines and you try your luck at getting tickets for the One Man's Dream II show and for seats in the central viewing area for Once Upon A Time. If you are not lucky, the first show for OMD II is open to all (although queues start early), and you can still watch Once Upon A Time from the the area surrounding the castle.According to the crowd calendar, we visited during a low season. Queues start forming at the gates about an hour before opening, and if you are there when they open, you will get to witness the Running Of The Fastpassers. This is probably one of the rare times when the Japanese seem to disregard the rules...the park staff will be positioned around the park entry, holding signs and calling out to people not to run, but they run anyways. Thankfully, the longest we had to stand in queue was 30 mins for the Jungle Cruise (similar to the one in HKDL, with some variation), most of the rest ranged between 5-20 minutes.Use your Fastpass, and use them wisely. You will not be able to get another Fastpass till the time for your first one is up. But some planning is required since you'd want to minimize walking to and fro. On our final day, since it rained almost half the day, they cranked up the heaters and hustled everyone into indoor rides like Haunted Mansion and Star Tours. Monsters' Inc went on a break about an hour before park closing, and we lucked out because they extended the ride operation for a few minutes after 10pm. Souvenir shopping? Most of the goods can be found in the main shops along the World Bazaar but each land has specific items...we spotted some interesting cowboy and native american inspired goods in Westernland, and Mickey & co Star Wars characters at Tomorrowland. Toy Story salami, anyone? The shops seem crowded all the time, but there is rarely ever a queue for the cashiers. They also have a habit of giving you extra bags for your purchases, please do the environment a favour and let them know if you do not need them.Foodwise, personally I think the prices are reasonable for a major attraction. Compared to Universal Studios Singapore and the Singapore Zoo, where a burger and fries combo (excl drink) can be about $10-12, a 4 course set meal in TDL (a popular option at almost all of the restaurants in the park) is about ¬•1000. If you abhor park food, the Ikspiari mall is a 10 min stroll away. There are many more dining choices there. Snacks are aplenty, although we strongly discourage all from their churros, they taste horrid. Don't miss the crazy popcorn flavours like soya sauce and curry, many visitors can be spotted with their thematic popcorn buckets. Shop around till you find one that you really like/everyone can agree on or you might end up with more than one bucket *oops*. Refills are ¬•500, or just buy a regular box for ¬•320.There is no halal food in the park, a ""viable"" option is vegetarian food at the East Side Cafe.  They were very obliging to offer replacements for the child meals as well, which is not vegetarian. There are also seafood items and baked goods. Oddly enough, the park rules state no food and drinks, yet they also offer picnic areas for eating your own food. The park visitors themselves are quite a sight to behold. The Japanese love to dress up, and it's fun to see them in coordinated outfits, couples, families (little kids in Duffy onesies are TO DIE FOR), princesses all decked out in their royal finery (the Bibbidi Bobbidi boutique at Disneyland Hotel does a gorgeous Rapunzel braid!). There are die-hard Disney fans, carrying their Duffy bears and other Disney plushies. All I can say it, the people there are so lucky to have this attraction in their country! I would love to visit again, in the coming few months esp because Frozen is coming to town!"
2536,5,N/A,Canada,Amazing for a first Disney experience. ,"We stopped in Tokyo for a few days during a recent trip to asia, and thought we would take our 5 year old son for a trip to Disneyland.  Aside from the overwhelming crowds and queues, it was an amazing experience.  The crowds get especially large after the parades.  Wow, it is like people soup!I only wish we had more time.   Our son was tired and ready to leave by about 7pm, but we had only seen maybe 1/3 of the park.  Definitely going to hit a Disney park in the USA, I think we had more fun than our kid did! "
2537,5,N/A,Australia,Loved!!! Best Disneyland so far!,"I had such a great day!!We arrived at the main station and walked up to the gates. Don't bother getting the Disneyland train ticket because it's only a small walk and its about 570yen. Even with suitcases and small children it's not a problem. The park and rides itself are immaculate. Clean and open so not too crowded, even at peak times. Make sure to take advantage of the Fast Pass tickets though, lines can be a while. We didn't eat here, just bought our own food because we wanted to buy souvenirs, and boy howdy there was a selection to boot. So many things to spend money on! All good quality things, made well and reasonably priced, though some of it was expensive for what it was.The rides were fantastic, especially  ones that had animatronics. Think world class Japanese robots plus disney and you have it. It was also Christmas time so it was themed and so magical! Especially because we come from Australia and a white Christmas is unheard of.Compared to Disneyland Paris, it wiped the floor with it. I wouldn't even bother going back to Paris main park (Studio Disneyland paris was worth the money for those who like rides though). So loved it, was an absolute must if you love Disneyland. My partner and I had a wonderful day and would go back again."
2538,5,14-Nov,Australia,Disney Christmas Magic 2014!!,"This is our third trip from Australia to Urayasu and the Disney parks. Having previously experienced the summer fun and spectacular shows, as well as Halloween, we were looking forward to experiencing Christmas @ Disney, and again Disney doe's it in style and with total style and was not at all disapppointed.While the rides are not a major drawcard for us, the lines were exceptionally long, and if you are planning a one day visit only, then you will not get everything done. A three day passport might help to get on the rides! The park is always crowded, and sometimes appears overcrowded with too many in the one place at the same time. there seems to be little crowd control, except for preparation of the parades, where staff are very diligent in making sure there is no happiness about taking up a spot for a parade. They seem to do their best to ensure you don't move from the spot you have claimed, you cannot stand on benches, prams and strollers must be folded up, do not put your feet over the edge of the pathway, and you could be waiting for up to an hour before the parade gets near you as it makes it way around the long course.Some guests clearly were over the constant walking up and down of staff that seemed to upset them constantly, and this in Disneyland, which in Tokyo doe's not translate to the 'happiest place on earth' as Mr Disney had planned.The control and need for the staff actions however is necessary with the huge crowds needed to be kept at a comfortable pace from the roadway and to give everyone a good view. It doe's however seem it could be handled better.Japanese fans of Disney are super fans, you never see anything like it anywhere else! They dress up, have bags of mini plush characters on them, some with dozens attached to their back packs, men wearing Mickey hats, and total mayhem when a Disney character makes an appearance, in fact, the only one we saw all day was a fairy godmother of something, not even a well known Disney character and there was quite a line up for 'one only' photo allowed!Pre purchase of admission tickets is the best idea as it allows straight through the booths, while the line up at the ticket booths is quite huge.Christmas Overload? Totally, if Christmas is not your style, you don't overly enjoy the festive season or, it's just too much, then Tokyo Disneyland will provide you with every reason to dislike Christmas!Everywhere, from the massive Christmas Tree in World Bazaar, to the daily Disney 'Santa Village Parade' and 'Happiness Is Here' parade, the constant Christmas music everywhere, and the shops then take on that Christmas atmosphere, not much you buy as normal Disney merchandise, it's all Christmas related from Christmas Wishes 2014 postcards, magnets, stand up tree, stickers, plush toys in Christmas outfits etc etc just such a huge range to choose from.Following the parades the stores are overcrowded and there's no room to move and to even get to a cashier you cannot even find where the queue is!Bon Voyage outside the park is less frenzied with all the same merchandise that is sold in the park.The quickest ride we went on was 'It's A Small World', a boat ride through the lands of the world, a quick ride, but at least something you can do and enjoy without waiting for more than 20 minutes!Tokyo Disneyland Electrical parade 'Dreamlights', at 7.30pm is spectacular and dressed up for Christmas, but is much the same as we have seen before.Food choices are very poor, unless you dine in the Crystal Palace restaurant, but even there the menu did not appeal. We stuck to hot dogs and fries, and Mickey pizzas. Flavoured popcorn was available all over the park, chocolate, caramel and cheese!! Cinderellas Castle is not decorated, that is because of 'Once Upon A Time' dazzling light show @ 5.30pm, an intriguing light show of characters and a story on the facade of the castle. Most shows are in Japanese, some provide english translation but that seems pointless, but this is Japan, and for what the park doe's, is good for foreign visitors.Just the overcrowding, long ride line ups, and crowd crushes in stores, can sometimes make this a place to avoid rather enjoy! Let the magic continue Disney, now on to Disney Sea!!"
2539,5,14-Jun,Canada,Magical,"We're big Disney fans, and this was our first trip to Tokyo Disneyland. We were not at all disappointed - just like the US-based parks its beautifully maintained, has friendly/helpful staff and great attractions. We brought our infant son and found the 2 baby centers to be fantastic for feeding, changing, etc. Note that this park gets crazy busy on most weekends and during Japanese school holidays in August and March. It is critical to check the Tokyo Disneyland Crowd Calculator (online) to determine when these days are.... and avoid them. No one wants to stand in a 4-hour line if they don't have to. My husband and I liked the food options, but many are not necessarily for a Western pallet, so if you have picky kids pack snacks. There isn't a ton of English spoken in the park, but staff are eager to help and so polite so with some work we always got our questions answered. Overall a great couple of days!"
2540,4,N/A,Australia,My First Disney,"It was great place, consider it was my first Disney this place really are a dreamy place. The hits attraction got a very long queque, but we can use a fastpast so it wasnt that bad. But ....I think it need more Donald Duck."
2541,5,14-Jul,Australia,Happiest Place In Japan!,"It was our first time to bring my son to a Disneyland park and Tokyo Disneyland did not disappoint! My son's eyes lit up as soon as he saw Disney from afar aboard the train. We stayed in Ueno but we never had a problem getting to this place because of Tokyo's train system was so efficient.We were impressed by the massiveness of the place. We loved the attractions, the shops, the food but most especially the parades: Happiness is Here parade and the Dream Lights parade. The light show on the castle and the fireworks ended our trip with a bang (pun intended).My only disappointment is that we only had one day for Disneyland during our trip. We didn't cover even half of the attractions. We know better next time to dedicate at least 2 days for Disneyland and 2 days for Disney Sea on our next visit.If you have a kid, Tokyo Disneyland is a must when visiting Japan. You will not be disappointed. Even my husband and I enjoyed it; it stirred up the kid in us."
2542,4,14-Nov,Australia,"Very disney, but not disney enough","I have now done all disney except Paris, which is planned for next year.  The feeling was that Tokyo Disneyland catered for locals not tourists.  The stores were very bland and the same merchandise all throughout the park.  I did not realize how much I enjoyed the stores at the exits of rides until they were not there at this park.  The layout is very similar to Anaheim disneyland, but it just did not have the same feel.  I must say the space mountain ride is the fastest of all space mountains I have been on, well it appeared to be that way.  Staff were very good throughout the park, very clean park, and enjoyable, but not as disney as USA.  "
2543,3,14-Nov,Australia,Not Real Disney,"I was so excited to visit Tokyo Disneyland for my birthday however it just feels like a Disneyland replica with no soul. Also, if you are a fan of queues then this is the place for you. there are so many people that it destroys all the fun"
2544,5,14-Nov,N/A,Its heaven but becomes Hell on weekends/holidays,"Never ever Never go to Disneyland on a weekend, Sunday or National Holiday. We visited on an extended weekend on a national holiday i.e. 24th Nov. For extended long weekend its DANGEROUS to go to Disney with kids. Very Unsafe scene. Everywhere there is long long cue. I am not talking about games. Its about going to restaurants, toilets, going from one place to other, even to buy ice cream or pop corn you have to be in queue for 20-45 mins. Now you can imagine whats the situation there. They allow 2-3 times the maximum allowed visitors / the capacity of the park. I took up this mater to the chief operational manager of the resort after a fierce fight for 2 hours. Finally I forced him with his entire staffs to accompany me to different rides and areas to judge how much overcrowded the resort was. I told them to sue them, but finally relented as they spent their entire evening with us walking with us and apologizing every 5 mins, taking my daughter to all the places like Mickey directly through a back door. When I saw happiness in my kid, I thought of forgiving them. I however, told them that they should introspect and curb their greed for money as they are already passed break-even since 5 years. Please note that, I could bend them and forced the Chief manager to come down to meet me ONLY after 2 hours and 6 rounds of talks with different officials and after a series of gradual increase of scathing rebuttal to them.   So the bottom-line  is, only go to Disney on weekdays, never during Christmas month, as a huge number of locals (30K) who have cheap annual passports come to the park and make it over crowded. SOME USEFUL TIPS:1. Always buy online ticket  so that you can directly access entry.2. Survey the Disney website and check all the videos of games and take a note, which one you want to ride.3. Take a English map and Go straight to one of the fast-pass games and take it.4. When you have spare time between a fast-pass entry time or waiting time for next fast pass ticket, visit to other attractions with normal queue.5. Always ask at the gate that how much time it will take from this point to the exit of the game. That will help you to maximize the utilization time. Always check the todays attractions leaflet and never miss them. 6. Watch the Day parade, its awesome.7. Watch the night show with light and fireworks. Its fantastic.8. Never waste time in simple roller-coaster rides or open air rides which you can find in any amusement parks. But Disney is all about the elegantly decorated inner spaces with excellent life like robotics and technology, which you will not find anywhere else.   9. Every ride are 3-5 mins and you have to be in queue for 20-30 mins for normal days and 2-3 hours for weekends/holidays. 10. But if you visit 2/3 rides your 6000 yen ticket will become worth of it. The kind of robotics and design they have done, its worth 50000 yen. 11. If you have time, better take 2 day pass. Its worth it. To check every nook and corner of park you need at-least 4 days."
2545,5,14-Aug,Australia,Childhood Never End,"This is awesome! Better than DIsneyland in Paris anyway. Everything perfect and clean except we cant visit ""Night Before Christmas"" castle. But too bad I only see few characters. Food was good but a bit pricy."
2546,4,14-May,Australia,Requires research,"While we thoroughly enjoyed our time at Tokyo Disney, I cannot stress enough how much planning needs to be done beforehand if you intend on having a positive experience there. It is not an ideal place to turn up to without having had done some research or planning. Expect crowds, expect long lines and waits for rides (& in some cases, food too). The vast majority of Tokyo Disney's massive patronage are people who possess annual passes & frequent the park regularly (well, more so than tourists). They think nothing of lining up for hours (plural) for one ride. We went on a Tuesday and although it wasn't a 'peak' day it was still very busy. We arrived just before opening and already a large crowd was waiting to enter. Utilise the map and get an idea of what rides you want to go on. Some rides are more 'popular', so consider doing these upon entry to the park when lines will be shortest. Collect fast passes for the other rides which will give you some time to explore. If you have internet on your phone, consider downloading the app that shows ride wait times to better judge your next move. While not 100% accurate it is still very helpful. We would sometimes still check it upon our return home to be amused by the 3 hour wait time posted for rides like Winnie the Pooh's hunny pot (great ride even though it's a 'kids' ride). We managed to go on all the 'major' rides and some minor ones. We ate lunch at the Mad Hatter's, decent food, some of which came on a cute little souvenir plate or cup. The park itself is amazing. Upkeep means it looks like it's brand new, theming throughout every little detail. I also managed to lose my fitbit (narrow wristband pedometer) at some point in the park. Despite thinking there would be no way of recovering it, I went to lost property where they took my details & was told I would either be contacted should they find it or alternatively to check at Disney Sea where we were going the next day. At the end of our visit to Disney Sea the next day I dubiously went to lost property and gave them my name. To our utter astonishment they had found my fitbit!  While this approach may not be appealing, even a little research will go a long way. Not only to help have a great day (which we did) but to also manage your expectations for what may be the happiest & simultaneously busiest place on Earth."
2547,5,13-Dec,N/A,Need I say more?,My daughter and I have been to all the Disneylands and we have ranked them all. Tokyo Disney is by far the best. Many will disagree but this is based on our experience. The whole theme park is well kept. The restrooms are clean. The whole place is splendid. Disney employees are very cheerful. This will be our 2nd time to visit Tokyo Disneyland and we're both excited! THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH!
2548,4,14-Oct,United States,Disneyland Tokyo,Visited during a typhoon so it was wet and windy. That didn't keep us from riding the rides and seeing the shows. Great place for kids of all ages. Food in park is pricy just like all amusement parks. Transportation to and from our hotel was very convenient.
2549,5,14-Feb,N/A,Love this place,Happiest place on Earth!  Must go back very soon.  What a special weekend for my family.  Say hi to Mickey for us.
2550,5,14-May,India,Very exiting place to visit.,"This is one of the best attractions of the world. There are hundreds of rides and thrilling attractions. You must have time of at least one full day if you want to experience all of them. Rides are very joyful and thrilling. There is something or other for all the age group visitors. Various food and dine options are also available. If you are a Jain or Pure Vegetarian, i would suggest you to carry some food with you."
2551,5,N/A,United Kingdom,Happiest place ever,I love Disney so when I found out after we had booked to go to Tokyo that there is a Disney here I couldn't wait to go. It really didn't disappoint and even though I'm used to Florida were its all in English the language barrier was not a problem at all and did not deter from the magic. Id also go as far as saying the staff were happier here than Florida (and def more so than the French in Paris Disney) . Would def recommend just gutted we didn't have time to do Disneysea.
2552,5,N/A,Australia,Made our day! ,"We visited both Disney land and sea and while sea is definitely more for adults and land more for kids and families, we had a far more memorable time at Disneyland thanks to the staff efforts. After leaving spending the entire day at Disneyland (arrived at 8 am and left at 10pm) we bought a set of dinner plates on the way out. After getting back to our accommodation (about an hour away), within the last few steps I tripped over and smashed one of the plates. We are staying in shibuya and there is a Disney store here so the next day we went there only to find out that the plate we bought is only available at the park. This wasn't going to be to much of a problem as we wanted to go back out there and look through the MASSIVE souvenir shop anyway. After arriving back at Disneyland shop we searched high and low for the plate but couldn't find it anywhere. We asked one of the girls in the shop only to find out that the plate style we bought is only available inside the park and to get it we would have to buy another ticket just to go in and get the plate. Feeling very sad and sorry for ourselves we thought we would have one last go and ask the ticket booth if we could go in just to get the plate. After a brief discussion with the management they allowed my partner to enter with one of the staff, buy the plate and then come back out. The staff handled our request quite well and I must say that they all do such an amazing job at keeping that Disney happy spirit going from 8am to 10pm. Working in tourism myself I know exactly how hard that can be but I don't think I saw any frowns at all for the entire 14 hours in each Park... Thank you for making our experience fantastic! "
2553,5,N/A,N/A,Happiest place on earth!,"I'm a hard core Disney fan, so I cannot not love this place.Space mountain & splash mountain are still my favourite!Same with Disney Sea, better go in weekdays & avoid school holiday. Although still, the lines at Disney Land is longer than in Disney Sea.. I've tried going there with the ""After 6"" ticket, it's ¬•3,900; it's great if you want to go right after office, and until they close at 10pm you can still squeeze 2-3 rides ^^b"
2554,2,14-Oct,France,Don't go during the Halloween season if you want to go on any rides!,"I have to say Disneyland Tokyo was a major disappointment. We went on a Monday in October and had heard that people can dress up during the Halloween season but we were not prepared for what we saw when we got there! At first we loved seeing so many people getting into the spirit of it and dressing up as their favourite Disney character, however it soon became overwhelming and at times it felt like we were lining up to just walk around the park ‚Äì there were far far too many people and I think it is crazy they let so many people in. On average the wait for a ride was about 2.5 hours however we did see a couple of lines that said 3.5 hours, two of the major attractions were closed too. We arrived at 10am and stayed until about 7pm but only managed to go on 3 rides, and one of those was with a fast track pass. We love a bit of Disney magic and are well practiced at being in crowds and appreciate that everyone is there for a good time, but it was definitely not the happiest place on earth and queuing up all day long wasn‚Äôt our cup of tea! There were queues for absolutely everything and even the popcorn lines were about 30 minutes long!"
2555,5,14-Aug,United States,Disney in the land of the rising sun.,Very enjoyable experience on a free day during our trip to Tokyo. If you are looking for different attractions from Disney world this is not the place. many of the same rides here but on a smaller scale. Still a great day!
2556,5,14-Apr,Australia,Easter Holiday,Highly recommend a visit and very similar to Disney Anaheim although still with its own uniqueness.  You have to try the different flavoured popcorns.  Easter parade was fantastic and the night light show was incredible. Everyone lines up early for the shows although we learnt even if you arrive 15 -20 minutes before the show you can still get a reasonable view.   Like most Disney Parks line ups can be long at times although overall a very enjoyable experience. Highly recommend the Queen of Hearts Restaurant for lunch/dinner.
2557,2,14-Oct,N/A,Not very amusing for adults,I think the rides are very kiddish.... no adventure... even non-ride attractions are very boring and slow... Not very interesting food options either!! Was very bored...
2558,3,N/A,Taiwan,Overloaded with rules and people,"Happiest place on earth?For sure not here in Japan.Too long waiting times of more than 120min for one attraction, let you feel really annoyed.And this on a usual Monday, a non-holiday without school vacations.Too may people and too many controlling of each move you do by the staff members.Certainly the place is nice, for sure well arranged and clean, you almost can eat from the floor.But again, wherever you go, cue up and wait for food, toilets, souvenirs and attractions.If you have the choice, go to Disneyland California, which has more space and not such extreme waiting times.Enjoy your waiting at Disneyland Japan!"
2559,4,14-Mar,N/A,A great visit!  Would go again!  Just be prepared to wait!,"As a huge Disney fan, I had high expectations of Disneyland Tokyo.  Disney did not disappoint.  I was surprised by the lines and wait times for all of the rides.  There were many school groups which may have attributed to the wait times.   I found it interesting how popular Mickey and Minnie were but how unpopular the remainder of the characters were, including the princesses! Also, fast passes sell out early.  So make sure you head to your desired rides first as you are not likely to get on every ride during your day.  I would recommend a multiple day visit due to the lines.  There are great dining options.  Take advantage of the amazing food and service!"
2560,5,14-Oct,Singapore,sweet memories....never be too old to act like a child...,"a must to visit in Tokyo, good and fun filled theme park...although it is all in Japanese, and I can't even understand, but still, it is a great place to visit...you will not feel that you are an adult in this place...do stay behind for the wonders and magical of the shows they have for you..."
2561,5,N/A,Australia,For kids and kids at heart,"Tokyo Disneyland is a great example of the magic that renders Disney parks so unique. It's vast, highly accessible (even to those who speak little or no Japanese) and, above all, entertaining.Now, as always, one of my favourite things about Tokyo Disneyland is the way most Japanese people approach it. It's hard to find a face without a huge grin and I love how so many people get into the spirit of Disneyland with cute matching Disney outfits, Mickey ears of all varieties and a general collective cuteness that's highly contagious. I also love the staff: they are super friendly, helpful and, in my experience, nothing is ever too much trouble so long as you approach them in a friendly and polite manner.The park is easy to get to via train; Maihama station is fairly central to Tokyo (see the HyperDia website to figure out the easiest and cheapest route from your location). I would not recommend taking the Disney Train line as it's only a ten minute walk to the park (it's easy to get to, just head left from the station and follow the signs).There's a daily lottery for tickets and prime viewing locations for the parks two main shows. If you don't get one you will get the other so don't panic. One Man's Dream has assigned seating so, if your lucky, you might even get a spot right near the action. It is best to get these at the start of the day so you can plan your day around which time slots you prefer. The lottery is located right next to Space Mountain in Tommorowland.Unlike it's twin locations elsewhere in the world Tokyo Disneyland does not boast fantastic food all round. Personally I'd stick with the multiple popcorn flavours scattered throughout the park (why not do it in style with a cute and eternally refillable souvenir bucket?) If you are in the mood for a solid meal in a good setting (and are not put off by a high price tag) then Blue Bayou puts on a nice spread.Being a Disney park things here aren't cheap. However it is worth noting that, as currency rates stand, both Tokyo Disney parks actually have the cheapest admission price worldwide. Be forewarned though: items at the park can sell out so if you see something you really love, buy it then and there. There are also generally multiple things that have been discounted (sometimes at less than half the price) so shop around to find something that fits your interest and budget.Another thing I love about the park is the long opening hours (generally around 8am - 10pm any day of the week). It makes seeing everything so much easier. Also you can easily leave your souvenir shopping until the official closing time as the shops at the front of the park stay open about an hour later.I'd really recommend you visit on either a Tuesday or Thursday. Unlike you can't help it avoid visiting on a weekend or public holiday as the people traffic will be insane and all the fast passes will be gone by midday.On a separate note I've noticed a lot of people complaining about wait times on rides: my argument would be (as with all other Disney parks where waits are a thing) lines are all about attitude. My husband and I waited 2 and a half hours to ride Splash Mountain and I would do it again in a heartbeat. It gave us a great opportunity to chat and people watch and the immense satisfaction when we finally rode (and on the front no less) was beyond words. If you're going to go to any Disney park with a negative attitude you will not have a good time. Honestly if that's the way you chose to approach such a wonderful place you don't really deserve to.Tokyo Disneyland is a must see Tokyo destination and you would truly be amiss if you missed the opportunity to visit such a truly great place."
2562,1,N/A,Australia,Avoid this place like if it's the plague,"Just spend a day there yesterday. The lines for EVERY single ride is at least 1hr, people line up 30min-1hr to have photos with characters, oh, I forgot. Line up to buy food is 20mins+ for normal* food, forget the restaurants. I ate some ice cream cos it cost me 5min, had some Donald burger and chips, line was 20min. It's a small world Attraction I waited 1hr. Felt like I wanted to kill myself.  Anyway, unless u like to wait in line for a living. Don't EVEN think about bringing your kids here. I have a one year old and four year old. I wouldn't bring them here even if the tickets were free.  The stupid free fast pass system is silly. Use once and wait 2hrs to reserve a diff line. And sometimes the fast pass reservation time is 4hrs+ wahahhahaa. Such a joke. Is there a button for Negative 5 stars?  I want my $$ back and time back. Few positives: The place looks awsome and clean. Staff are very friendly."
2563,5,N/A,Cambodia,Best place for teens and kid,"It's one of the best attractions I have ever visited. Every thing look so ""alive"" ( at least more alive than Universal SG and Universal Japan). it's was a great day and great place (Just don't take taxi, it's a bit far from town). Best of all, don't forget to compete eating Turkey leg with friend!! The taste was nice and it's sold almost everywhere there... BUT please don't expect exciting ride like Universal. It was meant for kid.Overall, it was a great trip! Worth a visit. (Maybe only for teen and kid. Not sure for adult and elderly)"
2564,4,14-Sep,United States,This is an amazing present for children,I went there during the Halloween season so there were a lot of nice decorations and the Halloween parade was great.  There's a lot of people at Tokyo Disneyland compared with the one in California so you can expect long waits for the rides.  Can be up to a few hours.  But this is still Disney Land and kids will have fun no matter what.
2565,1,14-Oct,Brazil,Is this really a Disneyland?,What I think is the best part of Disneyland parks are the employees that work there. They make everythink possible for you to have a pleasent day. At this park it was the opposite. We went to the attraction to Meet and Greet Mickey and they allowed us to take only one picture. We didn't know that. I was taking a picture of my wife greeting Mickey and the employee put the hand in front of my camera!!! What is that for? The family before us took 3 pictures. Worst Disneyland Park ever!!!
2566,2,14-Nov,N/A,Overcrowded,Went on a weekday not during any special holidays or anything and queues were ridiculous for everything and I mean everything. Parades were fun and full of energy but if u just want to buy merchandise and bump shoulders with a few hundred people and get your ankles rammed into by stroller then you'll have a blast 
2567,5,N/A,Indonesia,Happy place for everyone,"We really love Disneyland. We were there in October with two kids, one is 6 years and the other one is 13 months. They really enjoyed Disneyland. We will come back again in December :)"
2568,4,14-Oct,Australia,The happiest LINES in the world,"First ever visit to a Disney theme park, so it was a real learning experience for me. After arriving at 9am to try and avoid as many queues as possible, it does not take long for the lines to form - hence came my first learning - FastPass!Disney has a system called fast pass, where for selected rides, you can go to the ride, scan your entry ticket on the FastPass machine and it will issue you a ticket for that ride, to come back at a designated time period. When you do come back, you then pretty much jump to the front of the queue. Note that you can only have one FastPass at a time, so I would highly recommend, choosing a ride to 'FastPass', get your ticket, then go see some of the less popular attractions / eat /etc, go back at your time, then straight after go and get your next FastPass. Note that because they give you a set time, FastPass tickets tend to book out by mid afternoon - then you have no choice but to queue.Do not miss the daytime parade... despite an overly happy song being on loop for 20 minutes, you can't help but smile as you see all the floats and characters.Wear comfortable shoes - you will have lots of walking and standing in queues!If you do not speak Japanese - sadly most of the rides (with the exception of the Pirates of the Caribbean) are in Japanese - but don't worry they are still funIf you go on Splash Mountain - avoid the front seat of the cars... you will get drenched!If you are looking for super fast, scary rides - Disneyland is not one of those theme parks - everything is generally family friendly and the adrenalin level is not super high. DisneySea has more rides for an adrenalin rush."
2569,5,14-Jul,Japan,Nice,It was nice.  Would recommend trying to go when most do not.  I enjoyed it.  It is like most other Disneys.
2570,5,14-Oct,Cyprus,Great Experience !!,It was a day full of games and excitement for the whole family. It had three parades with Disney characters but the best was the night Led parade. We have never seen such a beautiful parade. Its a must if you visit Tokyos Disneyland  !!!!
2571,4,14-Nov,Singapore,Crowded! Crowded! Crowded!,"The place was really CROWDED!!! Cafe, restaurants, rides, shows, photo taking and shopping... All SUPER LONG QUEUE!!! "
2572,5,14-Jan,Thailand,The best amusement park in Tokyo for kids,"The kids theme rides were amazing. My son enjoyed it a lot. Especially the castle, the ship ride was his favorite. The night Parade was also amazing."
2573,5,14-Nov,Malaysia,Childhood all over again..,The last day in Japan we spent a whole day in here.. I must say it was crowded and full of running and exciting kids but the size is enough to put all it together.. It still comfort to walk and go play all the rides and taking picture with all disney charatcer.. I just remind me of my childhood and how I am so into with all the disney princess. This place is so big that you might need all your patient to wait for the ride. One ride that you must go is the Pirate Ship.. This is the most exciting ride from all of the ride inside.. So go for it at first and then continiue with the others. You can pass all the long waiting by taking the fast lane every 3 hour from the fast lane machine for some ride and the best is you don't have to pay for it but to wait until 3 Hours after the first redeem fast lane. IF you want to try the Hunted Mansion Ride go to scan your ticket on the machine outside the enterance of the Hunted Mansion to get your ticket with time state on it to enable you to enter the Hunted Mansion. The castle in side the fairt tale land was so amazing... Overall I will say this palce truly the happiest place in Planet for the kids.. It was full of handful staff for sure..
2574,4,N/A,Singapore,Very nice,Everything is good there but you must know what to do in the 1st place. 3D is good but must remember to do it very early morning. Best is to prepare sone food before you go. Definitely you will find problem to get food there. 
2575,5,14-Jan,Canada,Great visit but of course I'm a Disney Fan.,"Went with my daughter and she has now been too all of the Disney parks. This one us different given it's in Japan, but still delivers the experience. Careful when you go there are lots of school holidays that stuffs the park with lots of people. Our food allergies were handled well but our choices were very limited."
2576,5,14-Feb,Malaysia,Awesome Place!!!,"We went here back in February and loved this place sooo much!!! It was our first disneyland adventure (we are 27 yrs old anyway, hehe‚Ä¶). We went there quite early, before 8am in the cold monday morning but the line at the entrance super long. As expected the line for the ride quite long as well, but it was moving so you didn't feel you've to wait that long. As the line closer we could see that they have a very good system that made the line moving continuously. I'm not sure whether this is practice in Disneyland all over the world but we impressed.   Will definitely come back to check out Disney Sea next!!!"
2577,5,14-Oct,Philippines,The magic lives,"This was my first Disneyland experience in 1983, and going back 31 years later, it felt (for lack of a better word) magical. Now with husband and daughter in tow, the experience was even richer than when I first visited. The old reliables were there: Peter Pan's Flight, Pinocchio, Snow White, the tea cups, Dumbo, Pirates, Star Tours, etc. and they did not disappoint. We also tried the newer attractions like Pooh's Hunny Hunt and Roger Rabbit's cartoon spin. They were fun to ride as well. Just make sure you get Fast Passes for Pooh's Hunny Hunt way before everyone else does."
2578,3,N/A,Sweden,Children only,"This is a very small overcrowded disneyland compare to other branches , doesn't have thrill ride , mostly for children , just visit here if u never been in any disneyland before . "
2579,5,14-Oct,Canada,Very Disney,The folks here are so helpful..... although we don't speak the language we had no problems getting  our needs looked after  Food is a bargain here.   We rented a wheelchair for my hubby for equivalent to $3.00 for the day.  
2580,5,13-Dec,India,Awesome place for all ages,"Its a great place to visit...u will have fun, doent matter whatever your age is... get one day pass for 6600 yen... if u want to see disney sea then select a different day for it...................."
2581,5,14-Mar,Australia,Tokyo Disneyland,"This is our second time to Tokyo Disneyland. We love it. The only problem is the lines are very long, unless you get some fast passes early.The food is ok. Love their popcorn carts and the popcorn buckets."
2582,4,14-Oct,United States,A Disney Day,We visited in October; weekday. Still crowded. Attractions are very similar to same as Anaheim and Orlando. The popular attractions have excessively long waits of one to two hours unless you get a fast pass and even that may be impossible because they offer limited numbers of fast passes. All the attractions that have sound/speaking are in Japanese. Cast members are very friendly and helpful. 
2583,5,14-Oct,United Kingdom,Kids had a ball!,Queues to get in when the park opened at 8 were huge - we waited until about 8.30 and got in straight away.Tickets entitled us to book fast pass rides once every 2 hours - v worthwhile.The park has everything the other parks have and is as big. Voiceovers are in Japanese but a lot of the signage was in English so pretty accessible.
2584,3,14-Oct,Australia,Not what I was expecting,"My partner and I went here as we haven't been to a disneyland before. There were lots of people everywhere..... It was crazy! And not many children as well, which I thought was strange. The number of adults dressed up weirded me out. This park was very clean. Food is expensive but there seemed to be a good selection available. We went on one ride as the waiting times was too long and the next fast pass was very late. Okay experience, but sea was much better for the adults"
2585,5,13-Nov,Indonesia,Fantastic!,"There's always a lot of memories on Disneyland!Went there last year, we bought Disneyland and DisneySea tickets at once and spent each park on one full day.All the attractions were fantastic! The park itself is very clean, sitting area and toilet could be found easily inside the park.Will return again someday.."
2586,5,14-Sep,Indonesia,Great Holiday Place,"We (me 'n my husband) came here for our second honeymoon, it was great, love everything about this theme park. We love Disneyland, we always go to Disneyland Parks for every country we visited that have Disneyland hehe.."
2587,5,N/A,N/A,Happiest Place on that side of the Earth,"I went with the best friend (21 year old) on January 5, 2014 during our new years trip to Japan. This was our last day as we flew back to Canada on January 6. This place was magical, we purchased the aftet 3:00pm passes for i believe around $40 each. This was perfect as it was becoming dark around 7:00pm and it was lite up. The ride line ups were anywherw betweem 30-90 minutes and decreased as it became darker and kids went home. The parade waa beautiful with led lights.Compared to Disney World Florida, i would say Tokyo Disneyland was a  bettet experience. The rides.were the best from Disney World Florida with a few new ones exclusive to the area; all in one park, compared to 4. The price is much bettet (about $100 for 1 Day at disney world)This is also the only place in Japan that took Canadian Credit Cards. Everyone spoke English and all staff were friendly."
2588,5,13-Nov,Malaysia,japan in memories,"On 2nd January 2013, i has a fun & learning trip to Tokyo Disneyland. Its was above my expectations.With cool weather & beautiful place, its really fun & exciting even during my visit it was public holiday at Japan. Its was so crowded..all rides & attraction with long queue.I only able to walk around & take a picture for my own album at this beautiful Theme Park.If got another chances for sure i'll go again here.You will never dispointed.Here i also share some picture around Japan."
2589,5,14-Aug,United States,"Great, but little English","We took a large group here. It was AWESOME! For all ages, and all interests. The food was wonderful and varied, The rides were clean and safe. We used the fast pass and adored the system. It was difficult to not to have more English speakers since we had a disabled child with us. It would be great to have three days to do this park slowly. By the way, the popcorn and waffles were finger-licking good!"
2590,4,N/A,United Kingdom,Nice but long queue ,"The food was so much better than any Disneyland. However they don't speak English much and took about 45-60 mins to play game. It is clean, polite and very welcome ."
2591,5,N/A,Australia,Needs more than 1 day,"We got there around 9 a.m. Which was good for rides as there wasn't too much of a queue but later on in the day I got busy and waiting time could be quite long. Try to get the Fast Pass to whatever ride you want to go first and then go on to other rides that doesn't have it, just saves you more time. We didn't expect to stay until almost closing time but there's a parade from 9 p.m. And fireworks as well. "
2592,4,13-Nov,Australia,Australian school trip,"I went with a group of students from high school in Australia, it was one of our stops while visiting Japan. We were a group of 21 15 - 16 year olds and 3 adults, an amazing time was had by all, we arrived a little less than an hour before opening and as we had a group ticket we went through as soon as it opened.Wow what an experience for everyone, such a wonderful place  no matter what your age, lovely and clean and very easy to get around, the only problem was extremely long waits for some rides, but now knowing about fast passes that is definitly what you should do as soon as you arrive for the rides you woud like to go on, a big tip for one ride is if you ride on Splash Mountain as a single person you can skip the lines completely and head to the front of the line (you fill empty seats in carriages).  Overall a wonderful time, food was readily available everywhere and shopping for presents and souveniers was great."
2593,4,14-Oct,Australia,Wonderful Disney but too many people,"We have previously been to Disneyworld in Orlando and assumed Disneyland in Tokyo would be similar. In some ways it was  eg some of the rides are great, the staff are friendly, helpful and professional. I found some the rides were a bit weak eg the haunted mansion was not remotely scary. The queues were very long for some rides and very unpleasant shuffling along in the heat. The fast pass system is different and fairer but you only get to use about 2 before they stop. The variety of food outlets is good but the choice at each one is minimal. It made it difficult to find somewhere the whole family could find food they liked. We were fascinated with the different popcorn options, including curry, strawberry, soy sauce. Our favorite rides included space mountain and splash mountain. We would have loved to go on them twice but could not cope with more 90 minute queues. The electric parade was fantastic but you had to find a place to sit one hour before it to be able enjoy it. We were very disappointed that the fireworks were cancelled due to ""inclement weather"" but there was no rain. We loved Disneyland but we would have loved it more if there were less people and smaller queues. I don't think the size of queues would have been in Walt Disney's vision of the experience he wanted for customers."
2594,3,N/A,New Zealand,Not what i expected,I expected disneyland tokyo to be as english friendly as hongkongBut alot of the rides were in japanese which made it quite difficult to understand anything that was going onThe staff also dont know alot of english so its quite difficult if you need to ask anything importantAlso the theme park is overly packed Most of these people are only waiting for the stores and the parades The waiting time for most rides are long All the rides were mediocre i had more fun at disneysea tokyoThe food however is pretty goodOpening times are 8:30-22:00 You definitely need all that time to enjoy yourself
2595,4,14-Oct,China,You must know what you want,"The place is packed with people so expect long queues. If you are visiting for only 1 day, it's best to know what you want to do. E.g. The best rides can be accessed using a Fast Pass. Once you use your fast pass to book a ride, you can't use it again for a few hours. Moreover, best rides run out of fast passes by mid day. Therefore, prioritise the rides you really want to do and start your day by getting a fast pass for the first one."
2596,5,14-Oct,Australia,Disneyland - great day,"We went on a Saturday (Oct 4) around 11.00 am, did not take long to get in and went on a some rides - 20 min wait,other rides were much longer.   Halloween was the big event and for a weekend day, it was crowded but we could still get around easily.  This was our second time and it was still a wonderous place to visit and the Japanese staff make it so inviting.  Knowing some basic Japanese will help and is much appreciated.  The night time light and fireworks display was fantastic and worth seeing, there are lots and lots of people there though so get a good spot early.  We went by bus and that took about 15/20 minutes.  At this time it was relatively inexpensive to get in and is good value - great day."
2597,4,14-Sep,Australia,Forget the rides and just enjoy the park,"We pre purchased a 3 day pass for both Disneyland and Disney Sea-total cost in AUD around $400. If you are staying at a nearby hotel, like we did, you also need to purchase a monorail ticket which we only discovered by overhearing another guest talking about it. Once you enter the park (no food or drinks allowed to be taken in and ALL bags, including handbags are checked at the entry) you initially think it doesn't look too busy UNTIL you get past the main entrance area. The queue's for the rides are horrifying and wait times of 2 hours plus-on a weekday- are apparently perfectly normal. On the 1st day went, we only managed to go on one ride after queuing for 45 minutes. The queues for the food and drink stalls are also extremely long and be aware, they do NOT use eftpos-cash only ! It was also impossible to see any of the shows as people sit for hours and the staff actually chain the entry areas prohibiting access. The parades are fabulous-just be sure to find a place to sit on the ground WELL before they are due to start. Whilst the Japanese staff are very friendly, most speak barely any English which can be a little frustrating. We had a much better visit on the 2nd day which was a Tuesday, and actually managed to go on around 4 rides. The night parade is also fantastic. The souvenir shops are quite inexpensive with the most incredible variety of items for purchase and they DO use eftpos. There are so many toilets available that we never had to queue, there are also designated smoking areas which are easy to find. Be sure to get a map in ENGLISH when you enter the park or you'll end up completely lost. Would definitely return as there is so much to see however being able to actually get onto a ride or watch a show would simply be an added bonus."
2598,5,14-Jul,Australia,We had a fantastic time at Tokyo Disneyland!,"This really is a magical place to visit and only the Japanese could provide such wonderful customer service, absolutely spotlessly clean and all the staff were so happy and friendly! I think we found the ideal time to visit early July - there were no huge queues, the longest wait was about 30mins for Space Mountain. We went mid week, don't go weekends or Mon & Fri. We bought a 4 day pass at the hotel with the idea of spending 2 days at Disneyland and 2 days at DisneySea but my boys aged 7 and 11 loved DisneySea but preferred Disneyland so we spent more time here.English guides are available and some English speaking staff - if a staff member doesn't understand they will find someone who does. Signs are in English and announcements are in Japanese, English and Mandarin. Near Star Wars heading towards Space Mountain there is a Lottery area where you can swipe your tickets to see if you have won tickets to the evening show. The electrical parade was fantastic, well worth seeing. One night it was cancelled because of rain but they had projections on Cinderella's Castle instead which were also great. Dining at Tokyo Disneyland is far cheaper than Movie World or Sea World in Gold Coast - we found prices good value, especially kids meal when eating out as a family. We enjoyed eating noodles at China Voyager in Adventureland, mild Japanese style curry at Hungry Bear in Westernland, pizzas at Captain Hook's in Fantasyland and Mickey Burgers at Tomorrowland.Kids loved the Mickey shaped food - Churros, Hambuger Buns, Nuggets, Ice Blocks all shaped like Mickey!A tip for those wanting photos with Mickey and other characters - you can  join the queue at Minnie's House for photos with Mickey or wait at the front entrance where lots of characters make appearances. We got photos with Mickey, Pluto, Donald and lots more at the front gate.The rides here are fabulous, not just thrill rides but also so many rides the whole family can do together like Buzz Lightyear. Use Fastpass for the popular rides, they're free and located at the front of rides. It's true what they say - this is the most magical place on earth and we can't wait to come back again."
2599,4,14-Sep,Singapore,One whole day is not enough,"The park is big with plenty to see. We were there while the Halloween cosplay event was on so there were a lot of people dressing up as princesses and fairytale characters. Crowd was a bit too much to handle given that it was a Saturday. Queues were long on any attractions at any given point in time and sad to say, not all rides were available for the handicapped/wheelchair-bound."
2600,5,14-Sep,Malaysia,Fun place for kids and adults,"Tokyo Disneyland is the must visit place when you are in Tokyo. Most visitors are local, I could not really see foreigners contribute big proportion. Avoid weekends and holidays as the crowd really overwhelming. I went on weekdays but the queue was extremely long. One game can queue easily 110 mins!! You can take the Fast Lane tix to save time, but you gotta get the tix fast as the tixs are limited. The day and night parades are something you cannot miss. Japanese sit down along the pavement so there will not be any blocking. The staff is very nice and they will use papers if you reserve the area for your members. The theme is set according to season. As it was Halloween theme, almost everything/souvenir they sell are Halloween related. Be prepared to dress up according to the theme. Why? The characters might not want to take pictures with you if you do not dress in Disney outfit or theme like outfit.There will be long queue buying tix at the counter. Please buy e ticket as you can enter the park directly without wasting time. If not, you might miss the photo session with Disney characters.The 3D Magic show at the castle is awesome. I remember this is not available at Disneyland World at Orlando. You need to pre-book the seats in order to sit in front of the castle.The only disappointment is the fireworks. it is not as grand as compared to HK and US. May be the location is near to airport and I can see planes flying above the castle. Please keep yourself warm during winter as the park is next to Tokyo Bay, it is windy after dark.Try to select Disney partner/good neighbour hotels as they provide free shuttle bus. If not, you need to squeeze the last train schedule."
2601,4,N/A,New Zealand,If you beat the crowds well done,"The park itself was great,  iv been to all Disney parks and I really enjoy the Japan parks, the only problem the crowds are ridiculous.  Luckily we did our research and know how to conquer the parks well but even that didnt prepare us for how busy it was (and it was a weekday and non holiday) Know the rides you need to do, pre buy tickets, be there early and optimize the fast passes (they will prob all run out by the avo) The show at night was great and the food wasnt too bad for a park however they dont sell water at the stalls only flavoured nd fizzy which was really bad in the high 30s heat, most lines were about 60-90mins but we did the park in a day was a long day but a good one"
2602,4,14-Sep,Australia,Fun but be ready to wait...,"Like DisneySea, Disneyland is full of crowds, this means be prepared to wait for rides, without a fast pass waiting can be up to 150 minutes!! But is is all fun!! Who doesn't love Disney?!"
2603,5,14-Apr,Philippines,100% fun!,"Visited Tokyo Disneyland with the family last April.  Even if the park was full, we still had a fabulous time.  The gift shops were filled with wonderful merchandise that only the Japanese could think of!  Kawaii!  The staff were super friendly too.Loved our lunch at the Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall.  Try the heart shaped burger!Getting there via train (from Asakusa) was easy.  Can't wait to go back!"
2604,5,14-Sep,Australia,A Day of Happiness!,"I loved Tokyo Disneyland.  This was my first time to a Disneyland and it left a great impression.  It is a big park but so huge you feel like you can't make your way around.I went with a friend and her 3 year old child.  The rides are more suited to kids and as I am not too much of a thrill seekeer, this suited me.  The child we were with enjoyed all the rides we went on including the tea cups, dumbo ride and a small roller coaster.One of the highlights was that heaps of theJapanese visitors were dressed up as their favourite characters!Food is not outrageously expensive but just a bit more expensive than what you would expect to pay in a regular shop.A great place to buy cute souveniors and Disney merchandise as there are LOTS of shops.It was VERY busy and I would say skip the parade and go on the rides as most people will watch this show and this means the lines are not as long during this period :)"
2605,4,14-Sep,United States,Beat the crowds go on a rainy day,"We opted to visit tokyo disney on a weekday, the first day of Japanese school and our Labor Day when it was pouring down rain.  We never had to wait more than 20 minutes in line and we made sure to use the fast pass to make our wait times even shorter.  The longest line by far was the Winnie the Pooh ride, I have no idea why.  There have been some good updates and the park is very clean.  American food is not very prevalent (shrimp buger, fish pizza, seafood calzone). So if your kids are picky bring snacks and fill up on popcorn.  I highly recommend the mid afternoon parade.  The worker let us watch it Ina handicap viewing area since there were no wheelchairs in site and we had a stroller and 3 young kids.  My daughter loved the parade!!  I highly recommend a visit.  Parking was a breeze and bought our tickets at the gate with no issues.  Left before the electric parade to avoid the crowds which worked out since it poured down rain at the end of the night and they cnxd it anyway!"
2606,5,14-Sep,South Korea,Good place to deep into dreamy day!,"It was really fantastic! As we visited there, it's the first day of Halloween festival. There were lots of 'cosplayed' people and it was great to see their customs and feel their mind. All attractions and shows were great but the night cattle show was the most beautiful show I'd seen at the amusement park."
2607,4,14-Sep,Singapore,One Big Costume Party,"We spent one day at Disney Sea, one day at Disneyland and extended to three-day-passes with the third day spent half at each park. There are simply too many attractions to visit.Tokyo Disneyland is very similar to Hong Kong Disneyland. What makes it unique is the local visitors especially the youngsters truly dressed up for the occasion. It was more crowded than Disney Sea and Disney characters walking around everywhere, many of them are visitors! The open space in front of the Cinderella Castle is one great meeting place for cosplay enthusiasts. There was not enough time to visit every attraction. A little homework and planning helps in making the most out of the trip.We found the following attractions worth our time:Big Thunder Mountain, Splash Mountain and Star Tours (worth the effort to get the Fast Pass), Gadget's Go Coaster.We found the following disappointing:Country Bear Theater (Stationary bears singing country songs), Pinocchio's Daring Journey (too many of cabin rides through lanes lined with moving characters on both sides), Haunted Mansion (funny ghostly characters and images; but required 110 minutes queuing time?!).The Fast Pass machines are located near the entrance to the particular attraction offering Fast Passes. After a Fast Pass is issued, the next Fast Pass can only be issued after a certain time printed on the first Fast Pass."
2608,5,14-Jul,Australia,Love it,"The Japanese does things very well. The transportation was efficient and quick and the Japanese were so orderly and everyone was nice. That brought the Disney experience a notch up for us.We stayed at nearby so we used the hotel shuttle to get to Disneyland and it was so convenient. We had been to the one in HK before and it was a totally different experience. The Japanese really love Disneyland and it shows...lots of people dressed up and it added to the atmosphere. The kids love all the roller coaster rides. Toy story was close on the day we were there.The parade was wonderful- we caught all the characters and we had a great spot in front of the castle and so all our photos came out great with the floats and the castle in the background. It was very crowded at lunch time - we queued for nearly 30 mins before we got food at the restaurant next to Its a small world.We really love the Italian restaurant next to 'Venice' where we had dinner. Again we had to queue but the CM were very nice and for Disneyland, the food was great. The kids had the kids set meal and the dessert came with Mickey motifs.We all LOVE the Mickey icy poles which were fantastic on a hot day.We love it so much we will probably go again."
2609,5,14-Jun,Singapore,Love their excellent service and well-maintained facilities,Took my elementary school kid there together with my husband. Simply love this place. It's a treat for the whole family. Been back every year since 3 years ago. Last year we there in summer and there  in winter. Never been to other Disneyland except the HK one (which I would never go back after one visit). Especially love the Toy Story shooting extravanga!
2610,5,14-Mar,United States,I love it,It is the same amazing Disneyland except everything is in Japanese. The parade at night is quite impressive.
2611,4,14-Mar,Singapore,Magic comes alive......,It was great but it was way too crowded. Queues were really long everywhere. Nonetheless it the entire layout was great and staff were fantastic at creating the atmosphere. 
2612,5,14-Jun,United States,Disneymania,Took my two teens to the park and had a really great time......what added to the fun was the locals dressed in their Disney attire and accessories. The staff in the park is wonderful so happy and waving to you as you pass. The rides were great and queue time not bad as we seemed to go off season and what we liked were not the same as what the locals liked. They are parade fanatics and line up on the route as the park opens. Must try all the varieties of flavored popcorn........our favorite was the milk tea and the melon soda and the strawberry. The souvenirs are different too.....they have their own line of clothing and accessories. What a great time and you can bring in your own bottled water or soda though I found most of the food and beverage prices to be like the US Disney.
2613,3,14-Jul,N/A,"Lowered quality, today.","Well, i just miss and hope people can share the ideal of old real desneyland, but now it doesn't exist any more. it must be hard to understand the high level art even for fans. how much art fans can really understand art? it is not much, so as desneyland fas are. now the staffs of desneyland are all by the fans, but they and their ideal are not as high as old school real artists, which created the original desneyland. the good atmosphere shows have disappeared, and too much crowded venues are with gloss decolations. i guess todays fans provably cant correctly qualify the high level art of pinokio andor dumbo, even watch the shows neither. if they dont have sence of art, so the result has to be as low as them.but still better than the other places, so i guve 3 points."
2614,5,13-Nov,Fiji,Loved it,"Have been to Disneyland in the States and this one is so much better! We had a good giggle when they were singing "" it's a small world after all"" in Japanese.  The Japanese are very efficient and go out of thier way to help you with anything you need. We were lucky to go during the week day so not as crowded as it would have been during the weekend. The food here is also much better value for money and much healthier than the American Disneyland. Our hotel was in Narita so it was a very long train ride back especially with two tired children in tow - would I go back? YES YES YES!!!"
2615,5,14-Sep,Malaysia,Childhood Dream Come True,"I am an 80s child and the parades and shows were so good they moved me to tears. Absolutely above expectations, and we are very glad we made the trip there as we were thoroughly entertained with everything we experienced there. Tokyo disneyland is clean, organised, safe and convenient when it comes to food, toilets, baby rooms. All the props, costumes, parade cars were well maintained. We visited with our 1.5 year old and we still had a good time. The weather was really kind to us. We didn't go on any roller coaster rides but there were a few rides that were safe enough to bring our toddler for. Absolutely worth the entrance fee you are paying for! You will need to spend a whole day there to see/ touch/ play/ experience everything. Go! Go! Go!"
2616,5,14-Sep,Taiwan,Tokyo Disney,"Tokyo Disneyland was well organized. We visited midweek in September so there were not huge crowds and wait times were not too bad. Like most theme parks, everything is overpriced, but you have to expect that. They do have an outside picnic area with lockers nearby, so you could bring you own lunch/supper. The parades were good and the Japanese are unfailingly courteous and smiling. Compares well with Disney World, Orlando but is of course much smaller. There is a Disney Sea Park as an alternative."
2617,5,14-Sep,Australia,Beat expectations,"We're warned this was a 30yr clone of Disneyland. Well it may be but is set out brilliantly so that no area is more than 10 minutes walk from another. The food is excellent & well priced. The locals enter into the Disney spirit 100%+ which really has to be seen. We have been to LA, Orlando & HK. In spite of our language struggles would put this right up there & would recommend strongly."
2618,2,14-Apr,Malaysia,Crowded in DisneyLand,"Its a bad experience visiting to Disney Land without a express pass. It's extremely pack and crowded during whatever season. Overall, 365 days is peak season for Disney Land as local peoples are love this place."
2619,4,13-Oct,N/A,Disneyland Experience,"The Disney adventure was not disappointing and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. We questioned was it school holidays as there were kids everywhere but it could have just been excursions or the such like. However the experience was well worth it.Extremely easy to get to with Japan's absolutely fantastic public transport. (We used it to go right through Japan).It was disappointing to wait so long for rides, most of the day is wasted this way and you will need yo go on more than one day if you want to do most of them. I hate queuing this long as it dulls the experience. The fast ticket system sucks as this only holds up the queues even more. If you want to ride then join the queue like everyone else.We overexerted ourselves on the teacups & came off feeling nauseous so be careful how fast you spin yourself !! hehehehe.It was great to see littlies dressed up as Disney characters.We were lucky to have awesome weather for our visit.I would highly recommend a visit but prepare yourself mentally for long waits.The staff were really friendly and the venue was spotlessly clean. Food was great and was expensive but it is the same whenever you go to venues like these."
2620,4,13-Oct,Australia,very well kept,"For a theme park that celebrated their 30th anniversary last yr it is very well kept. My 5 yr old had great fun but unfortunately there was not much on offer for my 2 yr old. The food was much better than anticipated both in terms of taste and price which was decent and reasonable (after having experienced Hong Kong Disneyland‚Ä¶)We went there by bus from Shinjuku station New South Exit bus terminal. There was no doubt about which bus to catch but buying the ticket was not as easy as expected since staff didn't speak English and did not seem to want to help even though they were free. On our return we caught the train which was much easier, just follow everyone else!The electrical parade is a must and is a wonderful wonderful way to end the visit!"
2621,5,14-Aug,Australia,"Tokyo Disneyland, Fantastic","This park is also full on,with plenty to do, see and eat and has a large variety of cartoon Characters that we've all come to love in our childhood.Characters such as Micky,Minnie,Donald and the whole crew plus much,much more.In one word Fantastic."
2622,3,14-Aug,N/A,Same as California's Disneyland,"It's just like the Disneyland in California, except the crowds here are all Japanese. Went here on a Thursday, and it was crowded like a Saturday at the California location. Stood in a 3 hour line for Monsters Inc. ride that wasnt even worth the wait. All the fastpass machines closed by 1/2pm due to the amount of people using them. Had really good curry flavored popcorn though. Very fun Japanese show parade where the crowds follow the dance moves that the Disney characters teach from a float. Avoid at all cost in the summer!"
2623,5,14-Jun,Turkey,Great fun!,"Our 5 year old loved it so did we! Although it was raining the whole time we were there, we had so much fun. Our favorite one was Pirates of Caribbean's ride. Yes it was crowded and some attractions had 1-2 hours wait but it was well worth it. Easy access by metro from the center."
2624,4,14-Sep,Japan,Tokyo Disneyland,Very attractive and well developed services and facilities for visitors with friendly and professional staff
2625,4,14-Aug,United Kingdom,Worth a visit!,"Tokyo Disneyland is similar to other disneylands around the world. The rides etc are identical to those in Disneyland Paris. However, Tokyo Disney is well worth a visit to see how it is done in Japan. Everyone takes Disney very seriously and it is amazing to see people of all ages dressed head to toe in Disney with loads of Disney accessories! The atmosphere is amazing because everyone loves it so much. The park is very clean and all the staff are lovely. The electrical parade in the evening is fantastic and everyone gets into position really early - people take mats to sit on and claim their spot ages before the parade starts. Another very Japanese thing that make makes Disney worth a visit!"
2626,4,14-Jun,Japan,Crowded but fun,"I've only ever been to this park and Disneyland Paris so those are the only two I can compare. To both parks I've only ever gone during the week. In Paris you can find some rather deserted days where you can easily do all the attractions more than once but I knew in advance that the Tokyo park would be crowded as anything (you just have to know how crazy Japanese people are about any Disney feature or character). So I didn't expect to have time to do all the 8 attractions I wanted, but I did! And I even got to go on Big Thunder Mountain 3 times, and Space Mountain twice. Both are longer and faster than in Paris. In fact I would say all the rides  go a little faster than the ones in Paris, have bigger drops etc. So people who don't like that very much should be warned.I wouldn't recommend going on a weekend, as even Japanese people who do that acknowledge they don't go on any rides but go there just for the atmosphere and the shopping and restaurants... this isn't my idea of fun even if it is true that people are all polite and smiling.I also recommend to go early as the school students start streaming into the park from 3pm and from then on you have to do much longer queues to get into any attraction.The food was not interesting (as any of the park food I've eaten) but some had really cute shapes.Sadly I've heard that in the world those 2 parks are very similar in terms of attractions, and that was true. There was only 1 extra attraction in Tokyo: Splash Mountain, which I absolutely loved, was surprisingly long (9min, it was really nice) and I highly recommend. There was only 1 attraction that was very different: Space mountain which I like better in Paris because of the retro Jules Verne style rather than the hallucinated ride in Tokyo."
2627,3,N/A,Singapore,1st ever visit to Disneyland,"Feelings of excitement overcame all other emotions so my review here may not be so accurate. Enjoyed all the Disney mascots but place was just too overcrowded even on a weekday! Long queues were seen almost everywhere, especially on roller coaster rides!! Didn't know how the Fast Pass system worked so didn't even manage to get one, haha! Overall a good experience and looking forward to visiting DisneySea next door the next time.."
2628,5,13-Oct,Taiwan,Dream come true,Tokyo Disney it can let your dream come true^^Dare to dream and you must be go to Tokyo Disnry.
2629,5,13-Oct,N/A,Great for young kids!,"I have been to Disneand in America but this was fantastic for my 3 year old. Firstly the people are so polite but there is also this amazing fast ticket system which allows you to book a time and come back, so no waiting in long ques with young kids. "
2630,5,14-Aug,Canada,The best Disneyland park,"Before going I was aware that Tokyo Disneyland is widely considered to be the best of the Disney parks.  I have visited Disneyland California, Disneyland Paris and now Disneyland Tokyo and I absolutely agree that this is the best of the three.  It was busy there, but not crazy busy.  More importantly, busy does not mean the same thing in Japan as it does in the US.  Busy in the US means bring some body armor because you're going to catch a few elbows and have to constantly dodge hundreds of children running in circles screaming.  In Japan there could be a million people there and you still wouldn't make contact with anyone, such is their culture, and it's a beautiful thing.The second great thing about Tokyo Disneyland is that it feels much more compact than the other Disney parks.  I don't know whether it actually IS smaller in terms of square acres, but everything feels much closer..you can walk from one side of the park to the other in no more than 10 minutes, less if you're in a hurry.  This makes going back and forth between space mountain and thunder mountain all day a much less draining experience than in other parks.  One negative aspect to Tokyo Disneyland versus the other two, is that the fast passes tend to run out fairly early in the day...when we visited the fast passes were finished for the day by around 1pm.  Maybe this happens at the other parks, too, and I just got lucky to avoid it on my visits, but I hadn't experienced this in the past.  Once the fast passes run out I lose my motivation to stay; I'm not prepared to wait 2 hours in line for anything, especially when it's 36 degrees and 90% humidity, so that was a bit unfortunate.Other than that however we had a great time at Tokyo Disneyland and like I've said, it's definitely the best I've experienced."
2631,4,13-Oct,India,Best for Kids,The Disneyland in Tokyo is a must visit for tourists with family as the kids would love this place. The activities start with the train ride to the park. The queues are quite long for the tickets. The same is the experience with the rides. On one occation I ended up in a show after 25mins of waiting and it turned out to be in Japanese. The park is excellent for kids coz the games and themes and settings are tailor made for them. Could not cover all the rides. The parade was good and if u want to take a closer look of it one would have to take a early seat in the grass. The people were very organised and was amazed to see how the people were polite and waited for the turn in the large queues with no one cutting in or breaking the line. The park is neat and has good options for food and shopping.
2632,5,14-Jul,United States,True Disney Park,We had such a wonderful time at this park. It is better (in my opinion) that Disneyland in Anaheim and Magic Kingdom in Orlando. The food is great - yes the food at the park! The rides are fun. Overall wonderful experience. Can't wait to come back! 
2633,3,N/A,N/A,Suitable for children,"Summer + school holidays ,very hot  and a lot people. Better go there early and get the fastpass first so no need to queue for so long. Fastpass is free and will finish.  and the 1day ticket is ¬•6400 if u just want to go and see the end of the firework show or once upon the time show then u can buy the ticket after 5pm mean entry to Disneyland after 5pm so u just pay ¬•3900. Monopod is not allow to use in Disneyland . A bottle of water is selling ¬•210 the food have many choice but not cheap."
2634,4,13-Nov,Singapore,The Best Disneyland Park,"We have been to all the Disneyland Parks in the world and Disneyland / Disney Sea Tokyo has never bore us.    I came to the conclusion that theme parks needs ambience and the Japanese crowd are the most participative group of people - I have visited Disneyland Tokyo about a dozen times over two decades; in all seasons, and the Japanese crowd (who comprise of about 80% of the crowd) dress to the nines for the occasion as Mini Mouse, Mickey, some goofing around and give the place a lovely theme park feel.  There is a high degree of cleanliness and general orderliness within the park;  unseen in any theme park elsewhere in the world.  Good social habits are largely ingrained within the polite and shy Japanese crowd.  It makes the entire experience of the park a very pleasant one, to queue in orderly lines with no one cutting in and everyone is amicably waiting for their turns.  Food selections are larger and the quality and taste of the food is much better.  Most restaurants within Disneyland / DisneySea comes with a souvenir container serving dessert for children and thematic popcorn containers which is a hit with my little one.  The gift shops selections are good quality and service is prompt and polite.  The parades are also well organized with the crowd parking themselves neatly in rows to accommodate the parade.  As Disneyland Tokyo is almost entirely in Japanese, so embracing the language or understanding it will be useful. Some tips for first time visitors:-  In case you bring more than one child and risk losing them in a crowd of largely non English-speaking individuals, prepare an identification tag with a contact number on your child in English and Japanese.  The Japanese are very honest people your missing child will be promptly sent to ""lost and found"" and they will be able to contact you from there. -  Most Japanese do not carry phones that calls international lines and park staff do not carry mobiles.  So do not rely on anyone being able to help you call international lines.  Make sure you and your partner carry mobile phones to contact each other.-  Parents with young babies should bring along changing mats, the toilets can sometimes be very crowded.-  I recommend staying at Disneyland Hotel or the Hilton Tokyo Bay for a few nights in the Maihama region.  Both hotels have good restaurants and there is a Disney shop in both with much shorter queue in both hotels.  -  Buy the Disneyland ticket at any JTB in your local country you get a better price and skip the queue ;-)Most importantly go into any foreign culture with an open mind, and relax if you cannot cover all the rides in one day - buy a three day ticket and go on a leisurely pace .. after all you are on a vacation."
2635,4,14-Apr,Thailand,Safe and clean park,"Apart from being regular Disneyland park like the Orlando, LA, Paris, or Hong Kong, this one is very clean. Shopping was fun with quality products and services.  Restaurant served good foods both taste and price (more of personal preference).  "
2636,5,N/A,Australia,Great day out,"We had a great day and learnt a lesson or two which I hope will help others get the most out of their day. Please not other reviews around this time do not mention it is Japanese summer school holidays. ..of course it was insanely packed with people. While inconvenient to our plans you should remember just like all theme parks they put on extra special holiday programs and shows, this holisay it was a Summer Spectacular water show.1. ATM - there are no atms accept foreign cards in Disneyland. I thought that was crazy and couldn't believe it at first. Unless you wanna go back to the train station ensure that you have adequate funds to sustain your whole day.2. FAST PASS - in Australia you can pay extra for the privilege of going to the front of the line. Knowing it was school holidays I queried if they had fast pass tickets we could buy. The girl who's english was quite good said they were included with our ticket. Stupidly I did not enquire further. I read the material that was supplied to us and found out there are fast track kiosks. After seeing that there was around 2 hour wait for most rides we decided to visit a fast track kiosk and found all you have to do is swipe the QR code on your entry ticket and you will be allocated a fast pass ticket with the time you can enter the ride. Be sure to make this the first thing you do when you arrive at the park. Note that the popular rides like splash mountain will run out of fast pass tickets very quickly. By 11 a.m. 2 rides had already been  exhausted.ENGLISH - most of the park attendants speak enough english to help you. Which is great as they speak more english than I do Japanese. The rides are all in japanese which is fine because you haven't lived until you've heard Captain Barbosa threatening you or 3-CPO having a panic attack in Japanese it didnt bother us at all after all we are in JAPAN! TRAVEL - Transport to the venue was fabulous. Trains in Japan are always good I was a little surprised at the lack of signage to get there along the way. When you exit the station go to your right (follow the direction of the monorail). Maybe I missed it but I didn't see any sign saying Disneyland, they all say Disney Resort...not knowing that the resort was right nxt door it threw me a little. p.s don't forget to use the ATM before leaving the station ;)PARADES - Definitely watch them they are sensational. I found myself clapping, singing and waving as each float passed (I always wanted to go to Disneyland when I was little so this was my big kid moment) and try to get a good spot along the footpath. You program will mention something about you being allowed to put your plastic down from 1hr before show time. All thw japanese carry platic sheets to sit on. They are kind of like a beach mat meets your windscreen sun shield. You can pick on up at any 100yen store. You dont need one but it helps stake youre territory and means you dont have ro sit on the path that has been scorching in the sun all day. Being only two of us we found that we could find a little nook between people to squeeze into from around 30 min before the show.SHOWS - I didnt know about all the shows so hopefully this link will help others http://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/en/tdl/entm/index.html . Due to popularity some shows are by lottery only and you need to swipe your entry ticket QR code at a special booth to see if you are selected.FOOD - There is sooooo much to choose from and because it is all mickey themed from the churros to rhe hamburgers you want a bit of everything. It was around 1000yen for a meal anywhere. We decided to go for the all you can eat buffet. At 2500yen for adults and 1600 for children I thought it was priced well. The food wasn't anything special but we didn't need to eat for the rest of the day (10 hours) so I think we came out ahead.Overall we had a fabulous day. We only did 4 rides due to queues (one of which included the little train inside the park...not sure if its a ride). Spash Mountain is a must for your souvenir photo. The characters are out and about but running into the one you want is more about chance and sometimes you need to be prepared to queue for a photo. We wanted a photo with Micky but the line was unbelievable. A great family day! A great day for adults! Don't be scared to dress up or really go Japanese and make sure everyone wears the same outfit (we did...so nerdy I know).Enjoy and may all your dreams come true!"
2637,5,14-Apr,Australia,Wonderful trip,it was a wonderful trip to Japan especilly in disneyland with kids great trip we are all enjoy it very much  
2638,1,14-Aug,Denmark,waist of time and money,"I visited Disneyland Tokyo, because I was told by many Japaness people to go, because they thoughg it was the greatest place. I have wisited Disneyland in Paris. And the park in Tokyo was nothing like it, there was no amazing parades nor any Disney cartoons mengling with the people. The thing the japaness people seems most interested in is bying merchindis. But why you dont wanna go is because of the wait time. I was in the park dom 9 o'clock to 19. I ledt in anger. At that time i had tryed a cinema with only japaness shows (they dont have any english) and a horror house. Then i went in line for a rollacoster but I waited for allmost 5 hours, i wasted all my time, because the rollercoaster had a shutdown for the second time, and this time they closed it for good. So after standing in line for 5 hours i had to leave the amusement without even trying it. I was so angry and when i asked the staff about the problem non og them could speek any english. At midday i wanted to have a meel so II choosed a small line for that. When I got inside there was an even bigger line. It took me 1.5 hours to get a single meel. I went to the information explaining my situation an all the bad experiences very kindly considering that i was furious. They where not very understanding and could not give any kind og refund. They said it is the same for everybody. This experience has without comparison been the worst in Japan.Unless you have slot og money, and a lot og time. DONT GO THER."
2639,4,N/A,United Kingdom,As Florida but longer queues,Disney excellence as always but we found the queues longer than Florida. For three attractions we spent over 5 hrs in queues. Be aware of.this although maybe we were unlucky
2640,4,13-Dec,Russia,"Nice for preschool kids, very crowded, long lines.","It's good for preschool age kids, it's very crowded, lines are for 40-50 minutes,so  we had a chance to visit only Goofy house, that  really did not worth 30 min waiting. No express pass available. The parade is fun, but you have to reserve a sit in advance sitting on the grass if you want to get close to the Parade. Generally cheerful atmosphere , visit only if your child is a Disney fan. We bought a cheaper ticket when you enter the show on/after 15PM. Our child loved it very much though."
2641,5,13-Sep,United States,Tourist enchantment,"The 3 years we lived on Yokota AFB were spent at Tokyo Disney, among other places. If you've been to one Disney you've been to them all, however, leave it to the Japanese to put on a spectacular light show and parade!! A MUST for any tourist!"
2642,4,13-Nov,Japan,Tokyo Disney,We went during the week and not on a holiday to limit as much as possible the long linesalso we went in November when the weather was nice and cool and all the beautiful christmas decorations were upDisney For the Roller Coaster Lover or as they say in Japan - Jet Coaster The Best way to do Disney is via fast pass usually you can only get them every 30min so its best to get one for one of the major coasters while you wait in line for another coaster that way we were able to hit all the major coasters they had and even a few smaller rides the smaller attractions are best to get right after the parade most people will be watching so if you duck out a little early you can save yourself a long wait on quite a few rides or if you don't care about the parade its best to hit as many rides as you can nowFood: soo much good food I recommend1. Roast Turkey Leg ..as you may nor may not know turkey is hard to get in Japan ..and this is smokey and delicious located in the western town sold by cart2. Toy Story mochi - get cute alien designed mochi dessert 3. Belgium Waffles in the shape of mickey or minnie mouse located near the entrance you can see the cooks working away to make these delicious treats*remember your in Japan people speak Japanese here not English so don't assume they can because its an American Theme Park ..be nice to the staff especially in the food court
2643,3,N/A,Pakistan,Good but some stuff losses in translation. ,"Disney has an amazing attention to detail in the park, the staff are lovely, welcoming and helpful and the park is immaculate. Definitely some great Disney imagineering going on. It's a packed place highly orientated towards families.Going on a Friday, the cues were long (70 -  120 mins) and the rides short to medium length. They have designed the rides well to get people and them quickly. The fast pass system is a great way too jump the cue but you need wait 2hrs every time to get another ticket, still at least you can skip the cue a few times in a day. The park is very much focused as a family park, there are no 'crazy' rollercoaster, no upside down stuff that we saw. Some rides have a lot of speaking, (star tours and haunted house) but the speaking is only Japanese with no subtitles. They are still fun but it detracts from the ride. Some on the shows have options for English and Chinese translations. Two rides had short maintenance closures in the day which was a bit frustrating. Food is ok but very Asian focused as you would expect and there are limited substantial vegetarian options. TOP TIPS. Get there at opening and get a fast track pass and try to jump on the big rides before people arrive. Crowds die down a bit in the afternoon and during major parades."
2644,4,14-May,Thailand,Enchanted moments,"We took 1 day at Disney Sea and another day at Disneyland. It worths to spend whole 2 days here. Many things to see ,to ride and to shop.The fantastic rides you should not miss are Splash mountain (more than 2 hours waiting time), Space mountain, Big thunder mountain, Monster inc.Manage your time with Fastpass so you can enjoy all attractions. For the shows (One man's dream and Once Upon a Time), you have to book the seat by reserving the free ticket at the booth near Space Mountain. I confirm you cannot miss at all. Note this to be the first thing to guarantee the best seat.Once upon a time is nightime spectacular show on Cinderella castle with projection mapping technology. You can see it on youtube. It is great enough to be the ending at enchanted place."
2645,5,14-Jul,United Kingdom,Apparently all Disney needed to improve was lots of neon lighting.,"This is the same as all the other Disney magica kingdoms however with an emphasis on light shows, because after all if the Japanese can't, who can??We noticed a unproportionally large number of people queuing in tomorrow land, this meant that you were able to get some nice size queues in the other areas. We went to the international buffet, which was AMAZING!! Good price and good to have a rest before taking on the rest of the day.The parades were excellent, we noticed that as foreigners the characters seemed to take a special liking to us. However if I had one bad thing to say, there were not enough characters mingling. Infact the only time I saw any characters was at the parades, my girlfriend was fortunate enou to get a selfie with mrs incredible, but at was it. We don't like the lottery system for the shows, you must go there (located in tommorow land) to be put into a lottery to get a seat at the more popular shows. You find out the answer immediately. It was upsetting for us as adults not being accepted on to any one of the shows, imagine how a kid must feel. Even those who did get tickets seemed to be queuing for hours before e show to be ensuring a seat. Overall though a very good day. If you go, have fun and if you don't dress up in Disney character outfits you will be out of place. The Japanese seem to take it very seriously, but love it as much as everyone else in the world."
2646,5,14-Feb,Australia,Family friendly rides (more suitable for kids and young children),"Tokyo Disneyland = more for kids and family (family friendly rides, nothing scary)Tokyo Disney Sea = more for teenagers and adults (because the rides are scary) - so if you're looking for sensation, go for Disney Sea. You can also go to both if you wish and pre-purchase your ticket at Disney Store in Shibuya to avoid long queues when you get there. I got the 2 day passport - 1 day for each resort. Make sure to bring snacks and bottle of water (you can refill your water there, water fountains are found everywhere inside) because you can get hungry while queueing and waiting. Before you go, make sure you dress up as Disney looking as possible (I‚Äôm sure we all have something Disney in our closets), wear a Disney hat, a Disney shirt, a Disney jumper / jacket, a Disney gloves, a Disney mask (you can get it from the 100yen shop in Shibuya near Shibuya Mark City), etc. By the way, the queue is SO LONG. It takes at least an hour to go on any ride. That being said, make sure you go there really early, don‚Äôt delay and just go in the morning. I went with public train and stopped in Maihama station. IMPORTANT: Disneyland and Disney Sea are both within walking distance from the Maihama train station. The Disney train outside the Maihama station costs 250 yen / person to ride and it only goes around and around. It is actually closer to walk from Maihama to Disneyland (as soon as you exit, it‚Äôs just on your right). I rode the train to Disney Sea and I felt it was quite a waste because it is also actually walking distance from Maihama (tip: ask for walking guidance from the locals, just ask ‚Äúanno sumimasen, Disney Sea doko desu ka?‚Äù). It can be challenging for us tourists to find Disney Sea as some of the paths do not have signs for it.  In conclusion, save money by walking, walking, walking =) For both places: 1.	Get Fast Pass ticket as soon as you get in (DON‚ÄôT DELAY AND DON‚ÄôT LOOK AT ANYTHING ELSE, you‚Äôll thank me later), find on the map places where they give fast pass tickets, all you need to do is slide you entry ticket under the machine and voila~ 2.	If your fast pass ticket time is now, go in the ride now (and you don‚Äôt have to queue, there will be a separate lane for fast pass ticket holders) If your fast pass ticket time is hours later, go queue in any other rides that is near you (don‚Äôt even bother walking far, there is NO TIMEEEE) and enjoy that ride ‚Äì keep riding anything near you and in the area until your fast pass ticket is upIf your fast pass ticket time is much later (nearing closing time), feel free to queue for rides that you wish to ride (don‚Äôt go far though, go in an orderly fashion, near place to the next nearest place, etc.) 3.	There is a time until you can get another fast pass ticket again, make sure you get a fast pass ticket as soon as that time is up (the fast pass ticket machine closes at 3 ‚Äì 4pm for some rides, especially during winter, so make sure you fully utilize the benefit of this fast pass) 4.	If your fast pass ticket time is beyond the time (let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs for 11.30am ‚Äì 13.00 but it is now 14.00), just keep using the fast pass ticket and act nonchalant, be cool about it, staffs don‚Äôt normally notice the times anyway since they are SUPER DUPER BUSY (long queues) 5.	Some rides are faster if you ride single (not in groups), like Indiana Jones rides, this seriously saves you lots of times (normally you get to go on the ride right away), but make sure you don‚Äôt queue in the wrong lane, there is a separate lane for singles which is normally empty (when in doubt, ask) 6.	As I said above, bring your own food and water bottle, and eat + drink while you queue (saves you time and money $$$$), or better yet, if you go in groups, ask few persons to queue and get the other persons to buy the food and drinks, and eat them in the queue  I hope these tips are helpful to you =) "
2647,5,13-Nov,United States,Mickey vs. Godzilla,"We spent 14 glorious days traveling throughout Japan awestruck by its beauty and respectful people. Visiting Disneyland in Tokyo was one of the many highlights. The people of Japan truly embrace the magic of Disney and it shows among their faces throughout the park. Every attraction was clean and thoroughly enjoyable. The food is great, the atmosphere energetic and bright. Entering the park is truly magnificent! It's unlike any entrance that we've seen to date. We've been to Disneyland in France, Florida, and California and Japan tops them all. Move over Godzilla, Mickey Mouse is here to stay!"
2648,5,N/A,Malaysia,Awesome Disney Experience,"Wow.....what an amazing Disney experience in Tokyo!!! This is our second Disney trip after Paris. Both were awesome.Both young and old will enjoy at Disneyland Tokyo. We went during winter on last week of January 2014. The queue was short, the weather on first day was rather chilling and cold but the second day was warm (winter clothing on that day was not necessary). Nevertheless, both days turned out to be a pleasant day to enjoy Disney here. The Mickey shaped ice cream was good and pop corns in various designed wares was a hit....the pop corns had various taste.. sweet, spicy and salted. We brought back different designed wares for collection.-:)The haunted mansion was not much of difference with Euro Disney Paris. All the rides was great....my kids loved it!!!! Must see the night parades...colourful and beautiful...good to sit at the sides and watch it till the end.The souveniers was much of japanese interest in hair clips, chains both neck and wrist, handphone covers...the chic ones. Choice of souveniers not the same as Euro Disney. But, a hit among kids and teenagers.We love Tokyo Disneyland....which brings smiles all over and laughter throughout......"
2649,5,14-Mar,Japan,a good time to visit,"(This review is for just Tokyo Disneyland, not Disney Sea)We visited in early March. It was busy near the entrance, but once we got into the park the crowds were small, queues moved along quickly, and we even had some areas to ourselves. A good time to visit to avoid the crowds in Spring or Summer holidays.We spent almost 12 hours in the park, and did not see or do everything. There really is so much to see and do in the park! Thanks to the scenery and music, in the park is like being in another world, transported from Japan. Apparently it is deliberately designed so you cannot see the outside world, and it works. There are a lot of fine details that add to the illusion of being in another world, particularly in the queuing areas while you wait to enter an attraction, so you're never bored.Staff are very friendly, everything was clean and tidy. The only negative may be the lack of a cafe where we could just sit and have a drink, though there are plenty of restaurants, fast food, and food/drink stalls around the park. Prices are a little high, but reasonable considering the high quality. I would go again - so much I want to do again, and so much I missed!"
2650,5,13-Nov,Indonesia,Dream Come True..!!,"Disneyland was 1 of my dream travelling destination since i was a kid, why..?it's just because i love Mickey Mouse..I was so happy it was my first experience going there & i really enjoyed it..even i couldn't not go around all of the spots,but still i could spend time to see attraction of Mickey Mouse & friends & electrical parade at night, fireworks & photo session with Mickey Mouse.. it was awesome..!!you could visit Goofy, Donald, Mickey, Pooh houses and many more..you can also try many kinds of rides.. the queue may take times but worth it..!!this is my dream come true.."
2651,5,14-Jul,Malaysia,Kingdom Hearts,This place is truly magical from the moment you walk into it. It was my first time visiting Disneyland and I'm glad I did. I now understand why kids love to visit Disneyland a.k.a Kingdom Hearts. It is crowded with children and it is the happiest place on earth for kids young and old!
2652,5,14-Jul,Brunei,Busy but worth it....,"We had a fantastic 13 hr day at Disneyland Tokyo last week.  It was hot and exhausting but we saw so many wonderful things and went on many fantastic rides. If you get the fast pass for a ride be sure to pick the ride you really want early!   The rides run out of fast pass tickets by lunchtime.  The most in demand rides are Splash Mountain and Space Mountain, so get in early if you want those ones.As for the others we didn't wait too long for most.  Roger Rabbit was about 30 minutes as was the Dumbo ride for our little one.The food was great and well priced.  Souvenirs brilliant and they do take credit cards.Keep a look out for the few stalls selling regular water, as they are few and far between.  Most stalls sell flavoured water instead.The parade in the evening was a spectacular event with incredible lighting - we left half way through to avoid the rush out the gate.Overall an incredible day."
2653,5,13-Sep,United Kingdom,Marvelous!,"I was in Tokyo back to 2001. For about a month staying period. I did not come to Disney till last week of my staying. It is quite a big complex, just only walk take your time. Not to mention dozen or hundred people queue up each ride. But it worth it. I can say it is a must for any one, even adult, as kids must have experienced a playground in childhood. Also you sure to enjoy night parade and firework...."
2654,5,N/A,Philippines,Dream Come True! :),"I never thought that I'd be able to visit Disneyland Tokyo. But when I did, my experience was beyond amazing! Lots of rides and stuff to do. Yes it's crowded but you still can enjoy the whole park! So many stuffs in stores to choose from! Upon entering, I lost my age. Haha.  Got really excited upon seeing disney characters, especially the princes and princesses (and they are all charming) at the entrance welcoming guests and taking pictures with them. Of course, I and my cousins got ours too. Inside was like a different world! One where you're like a kid again and I loved it! I love the rides too! Especially haunted mansion, star tours and space mountain!! And last but not least, the magical parade! I got teary-eyed as we watched it and it gives you that feeling of having the chance to become a child again. It's really a heartwarming experience. Also the place is really clean and staff are organized. They may speak in Japanese but still they're very courteous, friendly and helpful. They'll assist you in any way they can if you needed help. This park is a must see! Especially for families! Can't wait to come back! :D"
2655,5,14-Apr,United Kingdom,Great value and a great day!,"We had a fabulous day at Disneyland. The day we were there, they were closing at 6.30pm for an evening event however this meant that they opened an hour earlier and also that it wasn't that busy! We never had to queue for any rides for more than 10 minutes. This made a 4 and an 8 year old very happy and parents happy too!Heartily recommended, and if you want a relatively peaceful day I'd watch out for one of the early closing days!"
2656,3,14-Mar,United States,Be prepared for the crowd,"You don't know what ""crowded"" means until you experience it in Japan (or many parts of Asia).  Not only the wait for the rides were crazy, we had to wait in line to get into the gift shop or get a hot dog from a stand!!  The structures and buildings were amazing.  We had a great time enjoying the view.  If you are going there just to experience the craziness and enjoy the view it is worth it.  If you want the Disney experience, I would stay in Florida..."
2657,5,14-May,Taiwan,magical!,"I had not been to a Disney park for about 20 years, and decided for my birthday I would like to go to Disneyland. We live in Taiwan but settled on Tokyo instead of Hong Kong, and it was an amazing experience. We spent two days at Disneyland and skipped DisneySea. We had plenty of time to explore, and were able to ride everything we wanted at least once. I felt like a kid again, revisiting all my favorite rides and finding some new ones.I don't speak Japanese, so a few of the rides were less exciting without the story narrative, but we still enjoyed things like the Haunted Mansion for nostalgia's sake. Definitely make use of the fast passes - go for Pooh's Hunny Hunt or Monster's Inc first or you might not get one. These two rides were the highlights of our visit, and they are unique to Tokyo.Another favorite of ours was the curry popcorn. We originally wanted to try all 6 flavors, but once we tasted the soy sauce + butter and the curry we ditched that plan and just refilled our bucket with curry. It was a great snack to have while waiting in line. My husband really enjoyed the tiramisu ice cream sandwiches, and the caramel tipo torta [sold near Alice's tea party] was out of this world. We ate dinner at the Blue Bayou one night and the Japanese place in the World Bazaar another - both were decent and reasonably priced.We visited on a Thursday and Friday, and Thursday it rained most of the morning. We had to buy a souvenir umbrella, but the rain kept the crowds down and didn't spoil our time at all. If we came back I would want to add an extra day to explore DisneySea as well, but would still return to Disneylad to experience my favorites again. Overall we had a fantastic experience... Disney really knows how to make magic!"
2658,4,14-Jul,United States,"Being Kids, Again!","Good:-Each attraction is well-maintained, organized, and clean.-Staff/attendants--from the attraction to restaurant, even the ones in bathroom--were very pleasant and courteous! They delivered better service than Disney, CA. -Though very crowded, the lines were never in a stall moment.-Bathrooms are very decent--there were no stinky smell!-Lots of ‚Äòomiyage‚Äô (gifts) food-options. Bad:-Though burgers were nicely packaged and looked great, it‚Äôs meant for non-western pallet.  I was lost in translation with its flavors.Ugly:-NONE!My husband and I had  a great time--were like kids again!!!  Tokyo Disneyland is a must see!"
2659,5,14-Jul,Japan,"A Worthwhile Distraction, Especially for Disney Enthusiasts","When given the option, many choose to spend a day at DisneySea for its uniqueness over Disneyland, but if you are a Disney park enthusiast, this park isn't to be missed. Unique attractions like Monster's Inc. Ride and Go Seek and Pooh's Honey Hunt (an incredible, track-less, GPS guided, semi-random ride experience COMPLETELY different from its U.S. counterparts) and improved versions of Big Thunder Mountain and Splash Mountain give veterans incentive to go. On top of it all, the Japanese efficiency and customer service leaves the American parks in the dust and is an attraction in and of itself."
2660,3,14-Jul,United States,Tokyo Disneyland,This is the only bargain I found in Japan. The price is $64 BUT if you go Mon-Fri after 5pm its $38.00  The park is much smaller then Florida or Anaheim. The food choices were terrible. The place is super crowded. They had no shirts or souvenirs that said Tokyo Disneyland on them?
2661,5,14-Mar,United States,A True Japanese Original!,"This perfectly-run Disney theme park is a Japanese institution. It is immaculately-run, beautifully maintained, and loaded with rides, shows and parades that put most of the American counterparts to shame. The highlights include a imaginative Pooh ride that makes the US based rides downright embarrassing; a Castle walk though; a only-here Monsters INC ride; and a electrical parade that makes the US version look like a 1970s afterthought. The cast members bring a new level of service and ""Disney"" to the place that has recently been waning in Paris and the US. There are a few things to remember here given its popularity: 1. Arrive Early, stay late, use the FastPasses. 2. Go to the lottery ticket center for reserved show seats that you may or may not win. 3. Try all the local food favorites--there are some great finds. 4. Mingle with the locals--they are colorful, Disney-obsessed, and very friendly. 5. Relax --you're not going to see everything. "
2662,5,14-Apr,Qatar,Better than the States!,"We've done both Tokyo parks and the Orlando parks...Tokyo Disney and DisneySea give you all the thrills and fun without any compromise.  In a single day you will be able to run every ride that you want to (at least once or twice) using the FastPass system and normal lining-up.  As can be expected most of the pre-ride lining-up have the ""show"" in Japanese but you get the jist of what's going on. Likewise the rides are direct copies of the USA versions just with Japanese voice overs - again you get the drift of what's going on (as much as you need anyway!).  The biggest difference is the way that things are run - everything is perfectly organised and you feel like the place is operating on rails - perfect.  We loved the parks here much more than the states and the kids had a real hoot. Some of the coasters felt faster here than in the states where they felt a little ""family"" for us.  The Disney merchandise is a little different than what's available in the USA parks - and it's pretty awesome and unique to Tokyo. Our teenager was wearing some of it when we visited the Orlando Parks and even the ride attendants were asking her we she got the awesome merch!"
2663,3,14-Jun,Japan,"Great park, too many people","I love Disney. I don't like crowds. Try to go on a weekday if possible. Also, try to stay until late as most families start to leave around 5-7. I stayed until about 9-10 and I only had to wait in line for just about anything for 5-10 minutes!"
2664,5,14-Jul,Cambodia,Have to love Disney,Best to go on a weekday if you can. Make sure you use fast passes to avoid the queues. Food was cheaper than expected. A great family day out.
2665,4,14-Jun,United States,Great Park but CROWDED!!!,"I loved experiencing ""Disney in Japan"" at both Disneyland and DisneySea.  My advice would be, if you have access to other Disney parks (Orlando, California, Paris, Hong Kong) then skip Disnleyland and just go to DisneySea.  Why?  Disneyland Tokyo is basically the same stuff you get at other Disney parks yet with a Japanese twist but it is CROWDED.  If you're gonna go, get there at least half an hour before the park opens and have a plan.  Most likely you'll only be able to do a few rides early in the morning then the park gets so crowded it's not worth waiting to do anything.  This was in the middle of the week during the off season no less.  I can't imagine what it's like on a weekend or during a holiday season."
2666,5,14-Jul,Estonia,Best Disney park yet.,"I have now seen all of Disneys parks and this was probably the best in many ways although not as big as Florida of course.The staff really seem to enjoy their work I didn't see anyone without a smile.  Lacking on merchandising in my opinion but that can be good thing if it saves money.  One thing I didn't understand was why they don't sell water.  Just sports drinks and coke and no diet coke either.  They have a menu for allergens but it didn't really work as when I explained my allergy the staff person didn't have a clue and her I pad told her I could eat things I know I'm allergic to,  I ended up with a bowl of rice.  The rides are the same as the other parks wait times well organised some attractions have English narration and Japanese but guide books awailable in English Japanese Chinese and I think Korean.  I really enjoyed a very exhausting day here.  Most rides not too busy midweek but some had wait times of 100 minutes.  Space mountain was about 40 mins."
2667,3,N/A,Australia,Don't go on a weekend,We stayed in Tokyo for 5 days and only day that wasn't raining was a Sunday. We had no choice but to go. Rides queue were approx 60-120min waiting time. Fast pass meant waiting time was longer than expected. Only in an Asian country can you pay more to skip the queue. We were disappointed with waiting times and food was terrible and too overpriced. As a tourist I don't recommend going on a weekend and pack your own lunch. We stayed for over 8hrs and only managed to go on 5 rides.
2668,4,N/A,Australia,Wonderful day out,"Tokyo Disneyland was a fantastic day out.  We wentnon a very popular day so we had huge crowds to share the park with.  Upon arrival,  it was unclear where people with pre-booked tickets should queue & the organisation into the grounds could have been done with greater ease. Once inside, we hired a locker which proved very practical as it would have been difficult to go on rides with both backpacks. Queues to the rides were ridiculously long- over 100 minutes for some. The fast passes were great but you had to decide wisely which rides to use them on. The light show parade was outstanding & was thoroughly entertaining.  The food was fun from the vendors but the Alice in Wonderland themed restaurant didn't have the best food. The park was very easy to get to by train, with regular services running. Overall, it was a wonderful day with fun rides, friendly people & great atmosphere! "
2669,4,14-Jul,Australia,Fun,"Really enjoyed it, staff were friendly and helpful. Planning ahead is a good idea. Unfortunately some of the rides were closed, the website could have had more details of such things, including planned closures. Get a good idea of what fast track passes you want and get them as early as possible, there is a delay after you have just used a pass. The star tours ride is a blast"
2670,5,N/A,Thailand,Be a child for a day,I so much enjoy being at Disneyland. It's just enjoying to be a child again. Actually now I visited all 5 Disneylands in the world and I am always happy to be there. It's thrilling and relaxing at the same time. The problems of life just fade away for some hours. 
2671,5,14-Jul,Argentina,great,"I went with my family and small kids, was awesome. try coming during week days.,otherwise you will be queuing around 40 min, minimum in the popular games.   "
2672,4,N/A,New Zealand,"Fun day out, cheaper than expected","I have never been to a Disney park before, but have always wanted too since I was about 6. So 22 years later I finally visited a park with my girlfriend. We had a fantastic day, it was an authentic Disney experience but you still felt like you were in japan which we enjoyed. With the Japanese polite etiquette, queuing was very orderly, polite and efficient. We went on a drizzly overcast day and the maximum wait time was under an hour. We went via public transport and arrived by about 10.30am, the first 4-5 hours were busy but not silly, there was certainly a lot more people as the day went on. We left at 5pm and it was very very busy by that stage. The parade was fantastic, even for 2 adults (big kids) there is a limited amount of rides, I incorrectly expected some big thrill rides but the park is geared more for young family's and the magic of Disney, I wasn't disappointed though. Embracing it for what it was. I imagined it also to be very expensive. A day ticket at $65 and lunch at under $10 actually seemed very reasonable for an amusement park. We got there from Central Tokyo on the train which was also very cheap I would recommend visiting, particularly with children! I can't wait till I have some to take one day! We were also surprised at the amount of English translations in the park, almost all signage, maps and show times were translated. A lot of staff members could speak some English too. The rides with audio was understandably in Japanese, I wouldn't expect anything different though. The new Star Wars ride is fully in Japanese but was still really fun. Great day out, whatever the weather! "
2673,5,14-Jul,United States,Disney as Walt would have wanted it.,"Our family visited Tokyo Disneyland and Disney Sea. Although it was hot (wear a hat, bring sunblock and dress cooly) the Park was great. Plan to spend about $10 usd (1000 yen) on lunch and twice that at dinner. We were surprised that the park tickets were less than in the United States. Plan on around $60 for a one day pass. The park is very very clean the cast members are everywhere always smiling, always helpful. The queues for some rides are long so as always when going to Disney, have a plan. We were so impressed with the kindness that the Japanese people show to one another. There is no complaining in queue- they are so friendly. No pushing or shoving as can be the case in the US. There is a wide variety of food available with traditional dishes, American BBQ and pizza choices. We enjoyed Disney Sea more as a family of teen age boys. Well worth the money-the monorail and bus system are easy to navigate and run constantly. Try to stay at one of the Disney hotels. We were very pleased with the Disney Hilton."
2674,4,14-Jun,Papua New Guinea,Magical world,"We bought 2day pass for Disneyland and Disney sea.we visit last june30.weather was hot in the morning and raining at night.we avoided the rides with long queue and stick to rides where even my 3year old son can ride.we enjoyed the parade,all staffs are very friendly.anyone can dressed up as princess or any Disney character.All shows are in Japanese but my kids still enjoyed it coz of the actions:) Overall, the place is still fun for all ages."
2675,5,14-Jul,Sweden,The best of Disneys?,"We have been to most Disneys: Orlando, LA, Paris, and Hong Kong, as well as to tons of other theme parks - but I must say that Disneyland Tokyo is really one of the very best! We went a full day and did Disneyland Sea during the day and Disneyland in the evening (with a After 6 pm-pass). It was perfect and we managed to go on all attractions we wanted to, with the use of some fast passes, smart planning and some luck. The lines were shorter than at any other Disneyland. Never more than 60 minutes for any ride. The quality of the rides was Japanese, i e high quality! There were some rides we have never experienced anywhere else, and loved! And most fun of all was the crowd! Especially at night, when all the teenagers showed up, dressed like the characters. It was better than anywhere else in the world! So, even if you have been to all Disneys in the world, do not miss Disneyland Tokyo!"
2676,4,13-Sep,Japan,Tokyo DL,"Had a Family two-day pass for DL and Disney Sea. Good package! Disney is always a pleaser, especially for the kids. Unfortunately, lines as always. But, overall, fun trip!"
2677,3,14-Jun,United Arab Emirates,Nice but ....,"when they told me about Disney Tokyo I was excepting something WOW, but it was other way around. It was so crowded comparing to the one in Paris. They don't have much unique Disney souvenir."
2678,4,14-Jul,Australia,Queues done well,"This park is almost constantly busy and would certainly test patience in those who attend during major events and summer break. That being said the service is (almost) without exception, efficient and polite. Most attractions are in Japanese therefore shows may not make much sense if you're seeking to understand what is being said/sung. The internal rail fees are extortionate in comparison to the local transit system - which in Japan is extremely efficient and clean. The attractions themselves have difference to the other parks but probably not enough to warrant a separate visit if you've seen the other parks and are not a Disney fanatic."
2679,5,13-Dec,Australia,Disneyland - As only Disney can do!!!,Spent quite a few days there.  The park is fantastic for people of all ages and totally organised as only Disney and the Japanese people can do.  The people and culture that is Japan make it easy to get around without the rush and bustle.  Queues can be long but everything is worth the wait and the people take the time and patience to talk to you.You might have to be there early and it is better to have tickets in advance as the park can fill up and you will be turned away.
2680,5,14-Jun,N/A,Woo Hoo Disneyland!,"This place is fantastic. If you have been to Disneyland in LA, imagine it larger, easier to move around, identical rides, and Disney fans everywhere dressed in costumes. Yes the queues can be large but everyone is patient, polite, and friendly. Don't worry about any language barriers, just visit and enjoy! Oh, wear a hat and sun screen as there is very little shade. "
2681,5,13-Sep,United States,Oh-my-goodness!,"First of all my husband and I are HUGE fans of Disney.  One of the reasons why is the cast members, well Tokyo Disney takes that to the next level!  The Japanese culture and Disney was the best combination of worlds!  We have never experienced such politeness and thoughtfulness in regards to other human beings in our life.  It just magnified the already wonderful experience we were having.  The park is built with the crowds in mind and we were just amazed how even though the park was crowded it didn't feel like it!  While we were waiting for a show to start we were in awe(had to take a video)of how well behaved the children were while waiting for the show.  The park is simply beautiful and if back in Japan again we would do it in a heart beat!"
2682,5,14-Jun,Vietnam,The Best of Disney!,"It's Disney! You either love it or you should go somewhere else. In our case we LOVE IT! We love everything about the house that Mickey built in Japan, from the monorail to the parades to the shows and the rides.   Tokyo Disneyland is just the right size, for bringing back those memories of my first visit to Disney in the 70s.  The characters roamed freely and were readily accessible for photos. The cast members were courteous, friendly, and helpful. There was lots to see and do around every corner. My favorite attractions include ""It's a Small World,"" ""Big Thunder Mountain,"" ""Pooh's Honey Pot"" and the ""Electric Lights Parade!""  Disneyland Tokyo plays like the best of Disney, and it is not to be missed."
2683,5,13-Dec,Ireland,"Fantastic, what more could you expect from Disney?","I visited DisneySea in December 2012, and I thought it was great. There is a lot of English support, and there are very few rides when having Japanese is an advantage (Tower of Terror there is a story told at the start before you get on but you can easily ignore it, the Genie Magic Show one is all in Japanese, and while it looks nice it is a little pointless if you don't have the language).I've previously been to Disneyland Paris, and the standard was a similar level - excellent!My only word of warning is, that if you are only in Tokyo/Japan for a limited time, it's basically the same as other Disney parks elsewhere so I wouldn't go especially, it would be better to see the Japanese culture."
2684,4,14-Jun,United Kingdom,As you'd expect from Disney.,"Spent 3 days doing Tokyo Disney as part of a two week trip in Japan. Having visited Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong, this certainly hits the Disney standard. Space Mountain being closed through June was a small disappointment, but not to spoil the whole experience. The attractions are all of a high standard, but some attractions may be better suited to Disney Sea and vice versa, but that's just a personal opinion. Food-wise, you will find something to suit all tastes (you won't starve) but the Hungry Bear restaurant is highly recommended for curry and rice. If you're a popcorn fan, buy one of the popcorn buckets that you can put round your neck, as the (more generous) refills for it present better value for money than the sole popcorn bag. To avoid potentially long queues, use the fastpass where possible but be mindful of the return times (an example being Toy Story, where a fastpass issued at 1100 gave a return time 2030-2130!) as they may impact on your day if you're planning on attending shows in the park. If you are lucky to win in the ticket lottery (as we were) for the shows, the ""Once Upon A Time"" show is highly recommended. If you're visiting the parks for multiple days, buy a magic passport as it saves money in the long run. Overall, it was a good experience."
2685,4,14-Jun,Singapore,Nice attraction,Visited the place on a weekday and was surprised that it was actually quite crowded. We spent on average an hour queuing for each ride. Size was is comparable to LA. Definitely bigger than Hong Kong and Paris. Didn't managed to see the fireworks due to the rain... Overall still an enjoyable experience.
2686,4,14-Jun,Malaysia,a good parade....,"like the parade most.......must take a photo with the cinderella castle....can see the castle as soon we pass by the entrance....4 parades in one day...wow it was worth waiting until night to see the last parade which started at 7.30. not so many games to play and many of them was in japanese language.....went there during summer , it was a very hot day.....but at night the weather was a bit cool.....many of the japanese wear t shirt, hair pin, cap with the character of mickey n minnie mouse.....what a sporting mickey and minnie mouse spirit.....must visit if you like disneyland characters, but if like to have thrilling outdoor games, this is not the right place to visit...."
2687,4,14-Jun,Norway,Clean park. Smiling staff,"Have previously been to Eurodisney and Disneyland Florida. The park in Tokyo was just as good. Some attractions only had japanese language, but that was ok. Most of the staff spoke english if you asked about anything. Except for the ticket draw for the shows. That was what we really disliked with the park. If you wanted to see a show, you had to go to a lucky draw with your ticket. You had to choose which show you wanted to attend, then the machine decided if you would get tickets or not. Was only allowed to try once. We did not get any tickets for any shows. Bummer. Space Mountain was closd, which also was a dissapointment. Food : we tried the pizza place, which actually was ok. Popcorn : be aware - alot of different (for us strange) tastes around the park. Drinks - water fountains around the park. Sale of sodas, (except Diet coke...)Long lines for several of the attractions - 90 minutes was normal. Fast pass ran out fast for the most popular rides. "
2688,4,13-Jul,Cambodia,Love Disney,"i am a big disney fan and always have been so i am a sucker for somewhere like this. having been to the disneyland in paris, I would say that the thrill rides in the tokyo one are much less exciting, but the overall park has a really nice feel to it. The parade at the closing time was spectacular. One of our group also had a young child who equally enjoyed it."
2689,4,14-Feb,Australia,Fastpass!,Very good and a great day out when in Tokyo. Very busy no matter what day of the week! Utilise the fastpass system to avoid the lines otherwise 90 minute wait times can occur. 
2690,5,14-Jun,Singapore,"Last year was good, this year it is excellent","One would come to expect a top notch fireworks display and parades for just about every occasion for a disneyland which was what we experienced last year. This year, they have added a light parade called ""Once upon a Time"" where the castle is used a a back-drop to tell a beautiful story. Most of the queues for the more interesting rides are long, especially at the start of the day. However, queues do get shorter in the evenings and with the park being open until 10pm, one can still cover most rides with the help of a fast pass within a day. Thus if you can, it would be good to devote a full day to experience the park. For half days, the afternoon-evening half will give one more mileage than the earlier half."
2691,3,13-Nov,United States,A taste of home! But in Japanese,"It was so great to see many rides and attractions that are so familiar from childhood and from the States. However, things like the Haunted Mansion, which rely on a voiceover, were a bit underwhelming as we couldn't understand the Japanese. Lines are extremely long, even on a ""slow"" day. (We went on a random Monday.) Fast pass hardly makes a dent. It is rather small, so you only need 5 or so hours to do it. We had fun!"
2692,4,14-May,United States,Tokyo Disney a Unique Place,"This park is different than LA, Orlando, Euro Disney and Hong Kong. The castle is the biggies of All the disney. The lighted parade was great, the star war tour is unique, the small world ride is very good, but HK is better. most waits for rides is 50 to 120min , the sheer volume of people make it hard to get around at time . food was ok. My biggest complaint about Disney Tokyo is that there is not a wide variety of shopping. They do not have any shirts that have ""Tokyo Disney"" written on them. For some people this is not a big problem but for me I like having items with the name of the actual place on them. It would be nice if Tokyo Disney offered items that had the name of the park on them, larger variety of shirts would make a trip to Tokyo Disney more worth the buck. Although, Tokyo Disney is extremely assessable from  Central Tokyo, just a simple metro/JR rail line ride out to the park and you are dropped right at the front gate. Tokyo Disney is a must see attraction. It is fun, beautiful, exciting and also expensive, as any Disney Park would be. A Must Do went in Tokyo"
2693,5,14-May,Saudi Arabia,Perfect for Kids,Fantastic summer destination for the family specially to those with kids. Visited the theme park last month and we were very enjoy despite the huge number of visitors.
2694,2,14-Jun,United States,Super crowded,"We visited on a Monday and it was wall to wall people. You cannot just go into the show seating areas. To see the top shows they have a lottery system- you insert your park ticket into a machine which then asks which showtime you desire. After you pick a time it indicates if you ""win"" the chance to see that show. You have to pick a showtime, there is no option for any showtime, and if you ""lose"" the lottery you are not allowed to try again.  The wait time for rides were usually 90-120 minutes, and most rides ran out of FastPasses. Bring an umbrella to shade yourself in line! There are multiple parades thru the day, but again you have to grab a spot early, the crowds were 10 deep along the route. Although we enjoy Disney parks overall, we were all tired and grouchy by the end of that day! But don't miss DisneySea right next door - our experience there was completely opposite!"
2695,5,14-Jun,United States,It's Disney Japanese style!,"If you have been to Disneyland in Anaheim expect the same only it's a lot more spacious and much cleaner, with more shops. You'll really like the extra square footage because there will be tons of people when you arrive.If you've been to other disney parks then you know you have to do some major strategic planning beforehand, that is, when to visit the park. If you plan on visiting Tokyo disney park during the middle of summer on a weekend day then expect a rough time! I totally avoided this by going in early June (Japanese schoolkids don't get out till July) weekday.  All in all, i was able to ride just about everything that was worthwhile (at least 6-7 rides, plus space mountain twice) all in the several hoours until the park closed at 10 pm. When I arrived, the park was Semi crowded.  Seem like the Majority were schoolkids in uniforms. We were able to get into the Pirates ride no line Atari all!  Surprisingly most of the ride was in English!  Most of our day was lie,that we went for ride to rise with little or no waiting!  shopping for Disney stuff is incredible here. you're going to find some really good stuff here and the prices are in line too. Overall, great visit , if your a Disney fan you will love it here.  The different sights and sounds , different foods, uniques gifts.  You really will,be glad you came here! Look online great deals for visiting the park at night, for half price and half the crowd!  Have fun!"
2696,4,14-Jun,Singapore,Fun park but crowded,"We tried to buy the tickets online before our trip but the online system requires too many private information before we can even set up to purchase the tickets.  Eventually, found H.I.S travel in Singapore (located at 100AM mall) and bought the tickets for both Disneyland and DisneySea before our trip.  Service at HIS travel was good and friendly and they even sell the tickets to Sanrio Puroland (which we got at a discount compared to buying at Puroland directly).To get to DisneySea, you need to take the JR line (Chuo or Yamanote line) to Tokyo station and then at Tokyo station, one need to change to JR Keio / Mushashino line heading to Maihama station.  The transfer time takes about 15 mins, so do factor it in for the travel time.  Upon arriving at Maihama station, you can proceed towards DisneySea (to take the Disney rail) that will stop at Disneyland.  We were not aware of this and ended up walking to Disneyland, which can be quite a long walk for young children and seniors. It makes more sense to pay for the short rail right that takes one right to the park and conserve the energy for the time in the park.Having been to Disneyland HK, Disneyland Tokyo is definitely bigger and much more crowded than HK.  We were there on Monday and yet the crowd was crazy.  We skipped those rides that were similar to the ones at HK and tried the ones that were not available in HK Disneyland.Also, being someone who doesn't really enjoy waiting in queues in theme parks, we usually skipped the attractions that has a waiting time more than 40mins.  We will go to the ones that has a shorter waiting time and then come back again to the ones that we missed earlier if the waiting time has been shortened.  There are many rides In Disneyland and it's impossible to do all of them in one day.  Getting the fast pass helps (though they ran out early), so the next strategy is to target those with shorter waiting time first.  Don't worry, what you miss earlier, you may end up getting to the ride later in the day, with a shorter waiting time... (Provided you don't mind walking more in the park).Between Disneyland and DisneySea, my young children enjoyed DisneySea more.  DisneySea seems more calm and a little less crowded (crazy) than Disneyland.  There were some rides that they could even go for more than once."
2697,5,13-Oct,United States,Disneyland Rocks,"I've been here, Paris and of course LA. They are all the same just formatted a sprinkle different. This one of course had tons of Japanese cute children running around and it was a blast !Every time I come to Japan I'll make time for this place."
2698,5,13-Oct,United States,Just as fantastic as the original at less than half the price!,"What fun parks, beautiful with amazing entertainment!  Different enough from the parks in Anaheim and Orlando to provide a unique Disney experience, and at half the cost!  Really, how can you beat it?!"
2699,4,14-Jun,United Kingdom,Disneyland & Disney Sea,Great day out for the family. Easy to get to by train and our first experience of Disney Sea which was fun. We have been lucky enough to go to Disneyland LA & EuroDisney and  I still think LA is the best for atmosphere. Yes long queues even with fast pass but what else do you expect. It doesn't matter what day of the week you go expect it to be busy! Most staff here were able to understand English which was a change from in Tokyo itself and all were extremely helpful. Kids had a blast. Journey to the Centre of the Earth  and Splash Mountain both were hits. The Japanese love the merchandise and love to wear it with pride! If you are Disney fans & kids love rides then you are sure to enjoy!
2700,4,13-Jul,Singapore,my first time!,"Disney make me young again.went there with my mom (just the two of us) and i feel like a kid again!enjoy it a lot.Japanese people is so discipline, there is no problem with the queue. Love it!"
2701,3,14-Jun,Australia,Crowds and long lines,"Middle of the week and arriving before the park opened we were still at the end of a long line of people wishing to get in.AU$80 each and we get through the gates and again join long lines to go on the rides, in one case the wait was 1 1/2 hours.  By 10.30 am the estimated entry time for people who had ""priority"" entry was already 3.30 pm.Some rides/areas were closed and I believe this should be advertised before you pay to enter.Food, drink etc was fast food and not the greatest quality but the better couple of cafes etc in the place had waiting lines bigger than some of the rides.The anticipated street parade was Easter themed.  I must have missed something as it was the start of June.The bottom line is It is Disneyland and crowds are the norm.Make up your own minds on this one."
2702,5,13-Jul,Malaysia,"A "" dream comes true"" land","A place with thousand tales. I just love it! I went there once in every 5 years, have been there for 4 times. Every time I go there, every time I wish to go again."
2703,4,13-Jul,United States,A fun place to visit,"Such a fun stop! If you are in Tokyo for an extended stay with children (or are a child at heart yourself), I would definitely recommend stopping here! However, if you are in Tokyo just for a short stay and live anywhere near a Disney park elsewhere in the World, I would recommend taking in the local Japanese culture over a trip to Disney."
2704,4,13-Dec,United States,Enjoyable,"This is my third visit to the park. The kids love it as usual. We only wish that there is more translation of language to English rather than pure japanese. As we visit during winter time, it make the whole visit more magical and enjoyable. "
2705,1,14-Jun,Australia,Overcrowded -Do NOT go any day!,"had just 10 days in Japan and this was  miserable and a complete waste of time and money.  It was a Monday yet it was so crowded. I had to wait 20 minutes for a piece of chicken. I waited 10 minutes for water.The rides we wanted to go on we did not even bother. It was too long for anyone to have to endure 30 degree day and wait THREE hours to go on magic mountain.   And anything great had at least a two hour wait.  There is Cement and bitumin everywhere so it gets really hot and uncomfortable.The 3D movie was excellent and we only waited 40 minutes. The Small world exhibition was also brilliant with a half hour wait. The cups, 45 minutes just manageable....But of the 5 things we went on excepting the paddle steamer the waits all out weighed the time we actually got to spend on the attraction.It was the worst day of my trip and I would never recommend anyone go.My five year old for whom I attended really didn't enjoy it either, which was the biggest surprise.  It is so American, and the values are so over commercialised and conservative.  Not of this era that is for sure!People everywhere,  the park should cap the numbers. To not do so is just greedy and makes the experience terrible for all."
2706,4,14-Jun,New Zealand,Paradise for kids not so for parents :),"We visited Disneyland with two young children.Unfortunately the weather was awful ,rain, rain and more rain. To my surprise park was packed so I can't even imagine what is happening here in summer time. Waiting time for rides varied from 25 min to 90min. We spent there two days and felt like we missed on half of the stuff. We definitely will be back You need to do some serious research before visiting to make sure you will see what you planned.Overall it was great despite very bad weather. Kids loved it and that's most important."
2707,5,N/A,Australia,Reliving my childhood dreams!,"I'm not going to lie, I cried!! Although it is busy, get your hands on a fast pass it's like booking for spot in line and it's awesome! I was a bit let down as space mountain was closed and that was one of my to do things!"
2708,5,14-May,United Kingdom,Would recommend to all!,Enjoyable to all ages!!! The park is slightly different to all other Disney Parks as it doesn't have a Main Street USA it has the shops but it's all under cover.The castle is amazing!We watched the Disney Easter Parade which is unlike any parade I have ever seen!!! Very crazy but enjoyable!I also found it a little odd that there are no specific meeting areas to meet the characters. You just have to hang around behind the castle and wait for one to appear. Apart from this a fantastic Disney experience!!
2709,4,N/A,N/A,Fantasy land for adults and children,It is a place you never want to give it a miss if you grew up with disney stories. The atmosphere and enthusiasm from the japanese are so good that it will spread to you naturally.Be ready to spend one full day there. And so your homework and plan the different stops you would like to visit sequentially.
2710,5,13-Jul,Australia,The cleanest Disneyland I have ever been too.,"This place is magical, wonderful, amazing and so well maintained Park.Every ride is really well organised and hardly any waiting, So clean and very friendly Staff. Loved the gift shops and the mickey mouse Ice cream :)"
2711,5,14-Jun,New Zealand,"Every little girls dream, and fun for grownups too","This was my second visit.  The first was with my 6 year old daughter and this time I had my 7 year old son.  They both enjoyed it for different reasons.  The princesses and castle were a hit with my daughter while my son loved the Star Tours simulator and other rides.  It was raining this visit unfortunately, but we were able to by cheap disposable coats for a few 100 yen.  There was still plenty to do inside when it rained and staff were very quick to dry seats on outside rides when the rain stopped.  There was plenty of food to choice from and it was very clean and safe too.  Can't wait to visit again in 2016 with my youngest daugter, but if I only had time to visit on park I would definitely choose DisneySea.  "
2712,5,13-Oct,Thailand,In love with this place,"So many many people in weekend. Please avoid weekend and holiday. Pooh's honey hunt and Monster, inc. Ride and Go Seek are the must. Don't forget to use Fastpass. Come here, Put the disney characters hat on your head and Enjoy together!!"
2713,4,14-May,Philippines,Long line Everywhere,"We have been to other Disneyland including Disneyworld in Orlando, Florida. We decided to go on a weekday to avoid too much crowd. We did not expect that it will be equally crowded at anyday of the week. We went early still the line to the atttractions are impossible. The shortest waiting we saw is 70 minutes, mostly the waiting time is 120 minutes. We all ended up only watching 3 shows and no rides at all. Admission at ¬•6400 only end up sightseeing. Good advice to all never, never come on weekends and holidays."
2714,5,14-Apr,Singapore,Disney's Easter 2014,"Disney‚Äôs Easter is a special event held at Tokyo Disneyland from 2nd April to 23rd June 2014. Easter decorations can be found around the park and there's also an Easter parade. If you love a challenge, try going on an Easter Egg Hunt! There are 2 egg hunt courses to choose from - Standard (2 hrs) and Expert (3 hrs) but instructions for the latter is in Japanese only. Easter-related food and merchandise can also be found during this period. Really enjoyed ourselves and the Standard egg hunt course was fun!!For more information (plus a video of the parade), check out my blog post: http://jaznotabi.wordpress.com/tokyo-disneyland-easter-2014/"
2715,5,13-Nov,Australia,"""A+mazing"" A must to visit!","A+mazing...that means it's A+++++ amazing!My first visit to Tokyo Disneyland was in December 2009 and that was fabulous!My second visit was November 2013.....and that was even better!Better because they continue to evolve and update, and all the time keep Disneyland open and available.There is an unbelieveable Disney Castle, awesome!  Walking through the castle is fantastic!The only down-side, you could seriously spend a week here and still feel like you were 'running out of time'!There will be queues and waiting time, so plan your day.  My best advice would be go to the website and check out what is available and when and plan, plan, plan.  If you are going for one or two particular rides or experiences then that would be where you should start.Getting there you can get a JR train directly to JR Maihama Station, or there are buses that go directly there.  If you are travelling from outside Japan, for example from Australia like me then you should have a JR railpass, you can use this to catch a train from JR Tokyo Station directly to JR Maihama Station.  It's a couple of minutes walk from the station, but that's easy!When you are at Tokyo Disneyland you must, must, must have the 'Mickey' waffle.  It is delicious, made on premises and available with various toppings (of course the chocolate one is my personal favourite), washed down with coffee or the traditional green tea...and...YUM!!!!!  Try to stop at one!There is an amazing Pooh Bear store, yes, and entire store of Pooh Bear (and friends) merchandise, and of course everything Pooh Bear!  AND...if you are lucky...you get to meet one of Pooh's friends!There is a fantastic 'space' ride, paddle-wheeler, steam train, 'One Man's Dream' theatrical performance and everything Mickey and Minnie you could possibly imagine.Go on, unleash the child within and enjoy!Would I visit again...absolutely!Well done Tokyo...this is a credit to you and the staff of Tokyo Disneyland and a magical experience."
2716,4,14-May,United States,Nice,We have been to other disneylands. We choose to come during weekday and spring time for the nice cool weather. It was equally crowded during the weekday. I can only imagine how bad the queue would be like during the weekend. The Tokyo disneyland is bigger than the Hong Kong one. We love the stroller switch system where parents can take turn to ride while watching the younger kids. Of course the place is filled with facilities for everyone. We forgot our baby wipes and diaper. But it was available for a small fee if needed. So glad for that. We had a pleasant trip there and the kids enjoy it.
2717,5,13-Jun,United States,Really nice place with friends and family.,"We really enjoyed my leisure time at Tokyo Disney. Enjoyed the shows as well. Stores, food court, restrooms are clean. Attractions are incredible. Just loving it. Next time I will definitely go to Disney sea! I actually went there in 2008 but the dropdown menu only provides me 2013."
2718,5,13-Oct,Australia,Where the kid in you let loose!,"You will definitely need to go to Disneyland if you're in Tokyo!From the magical parades both day and night, to the shows and rides. The trip made you feel like a kid once again. I would recommend that you plan your day early, to get the fast pass to all the rides you wanted! Everytime of the year, this place will be swarmed with locals and tourists alike! So planning and time management is the key to get through all the rides and shows. If you have time, at least spend a day at Disneyland so you can catch the afternoon parade and night parade! They are the highlights! If this is the first time going to Disneyland, I would recommend a day in Disneyland and a day in Disney Sea. Due to the language barrier (if you don't know Japanese language) there are some shows that you might need to skip as you wont understand as they converse in Japanese like one of Aladdin magic shows. As this is my first Disneyland adventure, I would definitely would have preferred to go to the US Disneyland first, so you'll know the base of the shows. But all in all I still enjoyed my trip and definitely love to bring my future kids there!"
2719,4,14-Apr,Philippines,Not my favorite disneyland but a culturally rewarding experience.,"Everything was great, nice experience and culturally rewardingBut not my favorite disneyland. I would only come here sinceIts closer to my country in asia."
2720,5,13-Sep,Malaysia,Huge! Don't go on weekends!,"We went in mid September 2013, during summer time. First mistake was to go there on a Sunday! Over crowded like you've never seen before! Not even school holiday period, yet it was packed.Second mistake was going during summer. It was very hot! The sun was scorching hot and I was raised in a tropical country! Third mistake was spending only a day there. The place is massive, and the queues are even longer! Popular rides were sold out for the whole day by 12pm, including express passes, partly because we went on a Sunday! Conclusion, aside from the above mistakes I made myself, the joy of being there with your family is immeasurable. Go there and go again! One tip - Spend at least 2.5 days there to cover everything you need! I thought I could, but alas it was impossible not matter how fast you run or queue!"
2721,4,14-May,Australia,Awesome day,"Had a day here to explore. Park was busy (as is the norm) with waits at most rides >30mins. Careful planning and taking advantage of the FAST PASS will help. Parades were awesome with the highlight being the electric parade. Everyone sat down so everyone else could see. It was the best behaved crowd I've ever seen. I ate desert at the queen of hearts banquet which was the most amazing theming. (Cake wasn't bad either). Go with an open mind, expect a few delays and plan ahead and you will have a great day. Toilets were the cleanest I have ever seen at a disney park (compared to Anaheim, HK, Euro disney)."
2722,5,14-May,Australia,Fun place to spend a day with little ones!,"I've never been to Disneyland before so it was a very exciting experience for me!I went with a 2 year old toddler. Because of this we didn't get a chance to explore the whole park BUT the rides that we did go on with her - she absolutely loved! There weren't many other thrilling rides for adults.There were plenty of places selling Disney merchandise so you can deck yourself and your kid in Disney hats, giant glasses etc. I would recommend to not get overly excited like I did when entering the very first Disney store. There are more interesting and unique products you can buy throughout the rest of Disneyland.There are prams available for hire if you didn't want to bring your own. Plenty of baby change areas but due to the crowds and mothers lining up - I ended up just changing my baby on a bench somewhere.Definitely watch every single parade that is available throughout the day - I think there's 3 all up - in case the later ones are cancelled due to bad weather. Unfortunately we missed the night electric show for this reason."
2723,5,14-Apr,Malaysia,Magical Tokyo Disneyland~,"i went to both park which is Tokyo Disneyland and Disney Sea~ Disneyland and Disney Sea is different concept ~ Disneyland is mostly very magical because it is come with our childhood memorial even you are not the fans of Mickey/Disney because all the themes there will make you back to childhood just like wonderful just like example ""It's a small world"" this place is attract most of the visitor remember their childhood beside than that it also have alot of Show attract visitor too~ but just some tips for who travel Disneyland and Disney sea, some of the game you can take fast pass (for free) nearby the game you want to play - it will tell you when you can come back to play this game normally is depend on the fast past timing just like example it will show you ""1PM-2PM"" if you take around 11AM - 12AM depend on the number of visitor taking fast pass~ in between time you can Q the other games mostly if you Q by standard Q up it will be around at least 40Minutes ~ ok let share about Show Fast pass/lottery ticket ~ for Show section it also come with fast pass/lottery ticket ~ why i will write Show Fast pass/lottery ticket in between due to for Show section it will giving you as a Lottery by the machine show that you able to go for your show or not and it will randomly give out to the visitor you might be can watch 1 show only in the park or might be not even 1 show you able to get because only 1 chance in the park for the show section ~ let's talk about if you really want to watch the show that are tips there , so far the understanding of the show we know that's limitation number of ticket given by lottery~ even you unable to get it but you also have the chance to watch it because some of the show is open air so that you can see via from the outside just you need to standing in crowded ~ that is alot to share with the tips ~ i dont mind to share to you all just that's alot alot you must notice it ~ but for my own opinion that is very awesome for both park ~ Not only Magical of Tokyo Disney just like a Happiness bring back to me too~ hope that will make you too~ at last try to make your days at weekdays because it is very crowded on weekends~ you unable to play all but you do can visit most of the place there too~ you will spend your whole days in the Park~"
2724,2,14-May,United Kingdom,A bit dated,"It's been years since we've been to Disney so thought we would have a little taster by buying the ""After 6pm"" pass at the reduced rate of JPY3400 which allowed us unlimited access to everything until the park closed at 10pm. On consulting the map we were disappointed to see how few rides there were compared to the endless listings of shopping and food outlets. And the sheer volume of people made getting on those rides a mega task especially as Fast Track finishes at 6pm. The Electric parade was fun - It's a Small World was just as good as we remembered it - but generally it felt like technology has moved on but Disney hasn't. The thrill factor of somthing like Space Mountain or the Haunted House has gone - it all seems so dated and those endless lines don't help. One word of caution - the cars associated with the rides are all designed to carry the small slight Japanese. For big tall Westerners it is a very tight fit"
2725,5,14-May,United Kingdom,Great day,"Great park, similar to other Disney lands with the same rides. Pirates was narrated in Japanese which was a little odd and all the instructions for rides are given in Japanese but once you adjust and stop caring that you cant understand any instructions it was great. Well worth a visit but Disney Sea is a must too."
2726,5,13-Jun,Singapore,TOKYO DISNEYLAND & DISNEYSEA~AWESOME & EXCITING ATTRACTION,"It was my dream come true when I first step into this world of paradise~Disneyland & DisneySea!Whether is young or old, you will be delighted with all the fun & excitement. This cannot be missed when you're in Tokyo. It was a happiest place on earth xoxo :)"
2727,5,13-Oct,Singapore,Absolutely must-do!,It's my first time in a Disneyland and it's absolutely magical! Will recommend travellers to be there at 8am sharp as it gets REALLY CROWDED (weekends and weekdays alike)! You can get your tickets online or from the Japan Tourism Board (JTB) back home. I got mine from the JTB at Ion Orchard and we saved a good 15-20 mins queuing to get tickets. Do ensure you get all your speed passes and just immerse in all the fun!
2728,5,14-Apr,United Kingdom,still my daughter's favourite place in Japan,we have been to Disney land more than 10 times. my daughter's favorite is Winnie the pooh ride. last time we were there (Apr 2014) it was out of action. even so Disney land remains her favorite place. highly recommended
2729,5,14-Apr,New Zealand,First timer not disappointed,Wow it really is the happiest little place in the world. Not one staff member without a smile and everyone was so helpful and professional. I was a little skeptical before going but it ticked every box and more
2730,4,13-Dec,N/A,Nice theme park,"Should spend a whole day to visit. Waiting until midnight at new year eve to see firework. Have to wait 2-3 hours per ride, take the ticket in advance "
2731,4,14-Apr,China,Rainy day and several rides closed,"We have been to all Disneyland's except for Paris and this was nice, very clean.  Unfortunately Pirates of the Caribbean and Jungle Cruise were closed but we still enjoyed ourselves.  It rained most of the morning so most family's left in the afternoon so we had no lines for the rides after 5pm!  My daughter and I were able to go on Space Mountain 7 times with no wait!"
2732,4,14-Apr,Germany,Feel like a child again,"We took the JR train from Shinjuku to Maihama station and it was just a short walk from station to main entrance. We reached around 10 am + and there was no queue to enter the park. We were here on a Wednesday but the park was full of visitors although it was a weekday. The queue for most of the rides were long but some of it were worth it, for example the Haunted House and the Small Small world ride. The afternoon parade with the Easter theme was interesting and the night parade plus fireworks was impressive. The food and drinks sold here was on the costly side but can't avoid it. We had an enjoyable day here in Tokyo Disneyland.P/S: We bought our tickets online through the official homepage and printed it at home to avoid the queue at the park. Ticket can be bought in advance."
2733,4,13-Jun,Australia,Great!,"What an amazing place, just like the Disneyland in Anaheim, but all the characters speak Japanese (as you would expect, but still odd for a westerner!!). Clean, well run and very enjoyable, just like all Disney parks."
2734,4,13-Nov,Australia,"A great day out, albeit busy.","I've only ever been to EuroDisney and Tokyo Disneyland is just as fun, but twice as busy. We went during the week and it was packed. There are queues everywhere. Even the churros and popcorn stands had stupidly long lines.I highly recommend making complete use of the fast pass nice and early for the best rides. Speaking of, the best rides  are space mountain, thunder mountain and star tours. Even though there were queues they were very orderly and the kids were so well behaved. However, we had lunch about 2-3pm and there were no lines and the food was actually reasonably priced for a theme park.The light show at night was beautiful and worth staying for. However, depending on what time of year you go make sure you take a jumper (or buy a super cute Disney beanie). We went in November and it was a nice day with a slight chill however got really cold at night. It was super easy to get too and we just bought a pass at the gate (two day for Disneyland and DisneySea).If you go to Tokyo I highly recommend going however go on a weekday and still prepare for lines."
2735,4,13-Sep,Thailand,Disney Dream,When I was young I always wanted to go to Disneyland in LA but it never happened. Then I kept getting farther and farther away. But even though I didn't make it to the original I made the most of my Disney experience while visiting friends in Tokyo. It might not be the same as if I was a kid but there is no problem turning back the clock for a time and being a kid at heart. I did it or maybe Disney does it to you. Either way my dream of going to Disney was finally fulfilled and I am happy. If you have the chance you should go too. 
2736,4,14-Apr,Australia,Queues everywhere,"We went to Tokyo Disneyland on Tuesday hoping not many people would come, but I was wrong.  At 9am, there were hundreds of people queuing up to enter the park.  As soon as the park opened, we rushed to ""Buzz Lightyear's Astro Bluster"".  Already people were queuing up, but we managed to get in after about 10 minutes wait.  We also wanted to go to ""Monster's Inc - Hide and Seek"", so took ""Fast Pass"" which is like a reserved ticket, so if you come back to the specified time on the ticket, you can ride the attraction without any wait.  At the time of 9:30am, the ""Fast Pass"" time was 7-8 pm, so you need to get ""Fast Pass"" as soon as you enter the park.We also went to ""Meet Mickey"" where you can meet and take a photo with Mickey Mouse.  The queue seemed short, so we decided to wait, but the house where Mickey waiting was just like a maize, and it took so long to actually meet Mickey.  My son was very very happy when he finally met Mickey, so I guess it was worth a wait.It started raining in the afternoon, and the park got quieter, so we managed to ride a lot more attractions in the end."
2737,4,13-Jun,Singapore,Clean and Beautiful,"Our first trip to any Disneyland and we were not disappointed at Tokyo Disneyland. Even not speaking the language could not dampen our excitement.Be there early. Although the Tokyo Disneyland opens at 9am on weekdays, we were near the front of a queue by 8am. Japanese are very orderly by nature so no unpleasantness. However, tour buses start to roll in from 8.30am onwards. Come prepared to wait. Bring water and light snacks for kids. The park opens on the dot. You should have downloaded a copy of the attraction map and planned your route.For our photos and full reviews click through http://kidsonboard.net/blog/reviews/tokyo-disneyland/"
2738,5,14-Apr,N/A,Disneyland - like all the others,Factory of fun not only for children.Like all the others in the world.Got kids and don't live near any other - it's a must.
2739,5,13-Oct,Australia,MAGICAL,"I have been to Disneyland Paris and I have to admit that personally I prefer this one as this park is smaller and it's so much easier to get around, to find your way etc. but also you have less things to do (because a big part is also in DisneySea). The park is beautiful, very Japanese-cute-is/ ""kawaii"" as they say, but it looks a lot like another normal park. So it is a great park but not unique (while DisneySea is absolutely unique, it is the only DisneySea on earth and there's no other park with the same environments and specificities). I would definitively recommend this park but  is you have to choose, choose DisneySea!But if you can do both, do Disneyland first and then Disney Sea the day after to see and feel the difference :)"
2740,5,14-Apr,Singapore,"For a big country, this is small..","Easily get from place to place, hope it could be bigger. Queue are very long, it could take 3 hours to ride a coaster.. Many cute Japanese girls to see though. Those buildings are very well made and very fantasy-like, this might not be as fun and exciting for adult but it could be for children. Beautiful and clean. There is also car parade to see at a certain timing.Mostly they are some coaster ride, some fairytale ride and even train ride to see the place.For food, it was very expensive (for my currency). But, the food is nice and beautifully done! There is even a Mickey Mouse shaped in the egg york. Quick service order with PDA."
2741,5,14-Apr,Thailand,Best Disneyland experience,"Been to Disneyland Paris & HK, and Tokyo is by far the best. The staff are friendly, happy, polite and even though they do not speak English much, their excellent service makes this a happy happy place. And the park is extremely clean even though it was so packed with people. The fast pass were all gone by 10am. Be prepared for long queues for the popular rides. Plenty of restaurants and shops, awesome selection of different kinds of popcorns flavours. Highly recommend Disneyland Tokyo, I'm looking forward to coming back."
2742,1,14-Apr,Thailand,"Overcrowded, too long gueue, no more fun!","I used to be very impressed with Tokyo Disneyland when I went there several years ago.  However,  when I went back there again this month, I was very disappointed indeed!  Despite advanced purchased internet tickets and despite on weekday, the queue at the gate was very long before the opening time.  When the gate opened at 9 am, thousands of people rushed into the park as if there were an earthquake.  And I found extremely long queue everywhere, the shows, attractions (even for fast track!), photo with Disney characters, restaurants, restrooms, etc. Everybody wasted a lot of time in waiting and waiting, and at the end of the day, we could do only very few things while the admission fee was terribly high.  They allowed too many people into the park each day (even on weekdays), totally spoiling the atmosphere, causing too long queue, and wasting clients' time tremendously.  I strongly do not recommend anybody to go there esp if you have small children and elder people, and I will never go there again!"
2743,3,N/A,Australia,Good but not great,"This was my second visit to a Disneyland having previously visited the one in LA 18 years ago. The major rides like space mountain, splash mountain and captain EO were still the same and due for a refresh and left the park with a dated feel. Far more effort seemed to have been put into stocking the gift stores. Staff were all very friendly. We visited on a rainy Monday and the queues on rides were a max of 25mins."
2744,5,14-Apr,Australia,Exceeded expectations,"My recommendation is to go to the park on a weekday and arrive in time for opening. We arrived at 8:55am on a Monday morning. We were there from 9am-6pm. We managed to get on all the major rides - including Space Mountain twice! The longest wait was 35 minutes for Splash Mountain. It was raining which could have deterred a few people, but it was fantastic. "
2745,4,13-Oct,United States,"Park is as expected, but the people watching is stellar!!","I'm a Disney fanatic, as in I've been to ALL the parks (at least until they complete building Shanghai) and will spend weeks at a time at Orlando when possible (a good friend lives right outside the back gate). Of all the Disneylands (and I'll admit prefer the other Disney parks, animal kingdom, etc) I would put this as #3 after the two US locations. In fact I strongly suggest that if you only have 1 day and have seen the other parks try DisneySea, as it is unique -- some of the same rides but otherwise completely unlike the other parks. If you do go to Disneyland, be warned that the Japanese have a HUGE preference for cute, so either go to Fantasyland as soon as the park opens or save it for the late afternoon (after the little kids head home and before the ""romantic couples"" show up), because that is where the lines are the worst. The one line you MUST stand in is for the Winny the Pooh ride. There is NO comparable ride in any of the other parks. Yes there are other Pooh rides, but not like this. Here the cars are NOT on tracks, they free moving and are computerized and choreographed to dance around each other, spinning and stopping and then going backwards and traveling like leaves caught up on on a gusty day. For the most part it's a pretty smooth ride (I have vertigo issues, and I actually rode this on a day when I was suffering from two herniated disks in my neck, and I didn't suffer.) Be warned:This ride breaks down a lot (which is probably why it was never transferred to the other parks -- only the Japanese are polite enough to put up with it) so be prepared for that, but it is most definitely the ride not to be missed at this park. Other than that, from the purposes of what's worth seeing if you're an adult and have been to all the parks? The people watching at Tokyo Disney is something amazing!! Older women will show up in Kimono, younger folks will dress up as their favorite characters in the same way Americans might for a renaissance faire (and this includes more than a few adult cross dressers as princesses or Alice... I kid you not). Japanese men will embrace the cute with an abandon American men never would, and they seem to LOVE it if you take pictures of them (they'll pose). Also, be prepared for ""twins"" -- Japanese girls who will show up all dressed exactly the same. These will usually be in two's, sometimes more. IF they are not dressed exactly the same they will put a lot of effort into as close as possible. The outfits range from disneyesque to girlband and should not be missed. The food is nothing to write home about (Disney Sea actually has way better food -- as in seriously good), but there are some 'interesting' snacks at the land. I made myself sick trying all the different flavors of popcorn, some mundane but some quite out-there. If you buy the expensive it hangs around the neck and will double nicely as a little girl's purse (gift option), they will refill it for a deeply discounted price at the various taste options (and if you bring it back a different day they will also refill it). There are also some other tid bits around the park that quite interesting taste sensations ... so nibble your way around the park rather than focusing on a sit down meal. On the downside, bring cash! Lots and lots of cash! Do NOT trust that you'll be able to withdraw from the ATM. For some reason it's only good for Japanese, Chinese and Russian banks. It won't accept either US or Korean ones (I was working in Korea at the time and had both). Otherwise, your credit cards are good inside the stores, but you can't use them to buy things food from the street stalls, so you WILL need cash. From a merchandise standpoint, there really isn't much to buy that you couldn't get somewhere else. As in almost no ""Tokyo Disney"" specific merchandise, just generic Disney (so why bother?). There are a few interesting Japanese specific things, but you need to look long and hard to find them (Donald Duck ear cleaners anyone? ... need I say more?). But realistically, if you want traditional Japanese stuff with a Disney flair, its not that hard to find on the streets of Tokyo. In fact, the best selection of merchandise is actually OUTSIDE the park in the main store that's right by the train station, so unlike Disneyworld, there's nothing to really miss if you skip the shops inside the park. In fact from a sales standpoint I've never been to a Disney that put so little effort into separating you from your money. Where Disney U.S. will let you transfer merchandise to the front gate for pickup, or even ship directly from the store to your home, be it US or international (for a decent price), the Japanese site charges you an arm and a leg to even send something light. Paying an extra baggage charge on your plane home would be much cheaper. Otherwise, the park comes with pretty much all the bells and whistles you'd expect (see their website)."
2746,5,14-Apr,New Zealand,Finally made it to the magic!,"Just to give a little background first: I have always wanted to go to Disneyland... since I was 2yrs old... so it's taken me 28 years to finally get to one!! :o) And I was not disappointed!It took very little time to get through the gates, was told to expect maybe to wait an hour but ended up being 20 minutes tops. I had waited 28 years so another hour wasn't going to worry me!The place was amazingly decorated with Easter decorations, in loads of pastels and cute little egg shaped characters around the park. The park was busy but not as crazy busy as I thought it would be, so could move around freely and enjoy the attractions. I am not a ride person at all so I just liked walking around the shops and seeing the people dressed up.. Donald.. Mickey.. Minnie etc. The lines for the rides were insane, but if you enjoy that sort of thing you might want to make your day longer there or do it over a couple of days.They had things that you wouldn't find at other Disney parks.. such as Soy Sauce or Curry popcorn, and my favourite... Carrot and Orange churros!! Shoppers paradise: could have blown all my money there haha but lots of cute gifts to take back home and a lot of things were really reasonably priced. My Minnie ears about $13NZD!! Cheap! If you don't wear something like that you feel out of place :P The staff were spot on and polite and made sure that everyone was sitting correctly for the parades, unfortunately the wind picked up quite badly so they had to cancel the parades for the day! Food was good, had a mickey shaped waffle for breakfast there and a coffee - easy peasy to order in English as well. I had a pork cutlet curry for lunch, glad I ordered the small as the large would have been way way too much. Make sure you get an apple soda from one of the vendors as it's so refreshing and the day was pretty hot. I was told the drinks were really expensive there but I didn't find that.I loved my day there and would love to go back again. A well oiled machine. My highlights were the New Orleans street recreation and meeting Mickey in his house with a professional photo at a really reasonable price too. Nice momento of the day!"
2747,4,14-Mar,Philippines,Still The Happiest Place on Earth,I recommend visiting Disneyland and Disney Sea on different days tp enjoy the attractions. A pose with  Micky Mouse took about an hour but still gives you the child-like feeling. I still love the musical fireworks finale over the electronic musical lights parade. It's a small world afterall! You can come across some Disney characters anywhere.
2748,2,14-Apr,United Kingdom,Not as magical as I had hoped,"My girlfriend & I arrived at Disneyland around 10:30am, with the sun shining and a glorious day of rides planned ahead.When we got through the gates, it became quickly apparent that the rides element of our day was unlikely to come to full fruition.There was a minimum wait of 120 minutes for everything, some rides exceed 200 minutes. We couldn't quite believe it. We were only able to get one fast pass ticket as all of the fast pass tickets had run out by the time we tried to get our second.It was a real shame. We assumed it to be because of the school holidays, although I couldn't quite understand why they'd allow so many people into the park if there wasn't the capacity for all patrons to access all the rides. I don't mind queuing to an extent, but 3 hours for a 5 minute ride seemed a little excessive to me."
2749,1,14-Apr,United Kingdom,Absolutely disgraceful!,"I first went to Tokyo Disneyland 27 years ago. Enchanting, fun, magical...yes. It was a place where dreams came true. I recently returned to Tokyo and first on my list was to visit this place where years before I had such a great time! I paid approximately ¬£36.00 (6000 Yen) to enter at 9.30 on a bright and sunny Monday morning. As I entered the queues didn't look too bad. I entered the park and yes it was looking a bit busier but I was pre-occupied with looking at my resort map and planning my day! Exciting!!! I had 6 and 1/2 hours to spend in the park and I wanted to do it all! I looked up and saw a crowd of people looking at an electric board which was displaying wait times for attractions...90 minutes was the shortest time displayed (Pirates of the Carribean) and 120 minutes to wait for most of the others and even a 180 minute wait for Thunder Mountain. I could NOT believe it!! I hurried to the Pirates of the Carribean and duly waited in line for an hour and a half for the approx 10 minute ride. I came out just after 11am and proceeded to the machines next to Big Thunder Mountain to claim an allocated time slot ticket for the ride. After waiting for 30 minutes the queue was told ALL time slots until 10pm were now taken. This now meant that by 11.30 with 4 and a half hours left I had little chance of seeing more than two other attractions with 6 hours of queuing for the pleasure! NO NO NO!!! I went to the help office to kindly explain that I was not happy about this and I would like a refund. I calmly and politely explained to the staff member that I would like to leave after the terribly unfair way they had allowed FAR TOO MANY people into the park and indeed outside the office you could see the entrance gates with 100's more flocking in! Even the queues for the food and drink carts were snaking around for what looked like at LEAST a thirty minute wait. I was politely told that I would be escorted to the gate and shown out (I think they just wanted the problem ME to go away). I remained calm and polite and I asked to speak to a manager. After waiting another ten minutes a manager appeared and I was told in no uncertain terms that there would be NO refund. I was very unhappy and was given a complaints form which three weeks later I have not heard back from. I left the park feeling very unhappy, upset and terribly disappointed with the way Japanese customer service had for the first time left me feeling dreadfully wronged and helpless. I want to know why, with families and children, they think it's acceptable to queue in such incredibly long lines. I have been to MANY theme parks and I KNOW and EXPECT to queue. But these lines were so unfeasibly long, it was impossible to see more than two attractions if you also needed to buy a drink/food. Terrible customer service. Terrible place. Badly organised. I am so angry with DISNEY, this is NOT the place where dreams come true! A week later we had a great time at Universal Studios in Osaka. We had the choice to buy fast track tickets (expensive but worth it) the day was the opposite of the tragic Disney experience. We enjoyed the day immensely, got into the spirit of the day and had great fun! Tokyo Disneyland is a RIP OFF and I will NOT be going back. EVER!"
2750,5,14-Jan,Australia,FANTASTIC!!!,"If you been to other disneylands, then you won‚Äôt find too much difference here (although thats not to say I had a bad time, I love Disneyland and I love Tokyo Disneyland). You‚Äôve got all the same themed areas and rides like Pirates of the Carribean, Splash Mountain, Captain EO and Space Mountain. The four things I recommend why Tokyo Disneyland is worth a visit- Poohs Hunny Hunt - A great trackless ride, can‚Äôt be found anywhere in the world- Monsters Inc Hide and Go Seek - A great ride, think a mixture of Buzz Lightyear Astro Blaster and Universals Men in Black ride, too bad it doesn‚Äôt keep score- Electric Parade , just amazing- Toonland, which was taken down in Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland is the only disneyland that still has rides like Chip and Dales roller coaster and the Roger Rabbit land"
2751,4,14-Apr,Australia,Fun day out,"Had a great day out at Disneyland, we went on a Thursday so the park was pretty quiet so our longest wait was about 30 mins. The fast pass is also a great idea to ensure you don't waist time standing around in lines! Make sure you don't miss Disneysea, we found this park so much better!"
2752,5,N/A,United Kingdom,Brilliant!,"We arrived at 12 noon & had a fabulous time, easily fitting in all we wanted to do. Unlike the US & French resorts, this was NOT a rip off, both to go in or for food & drinks inside (25,000 yen for 2 adults, 1 teenager, 1 child). The crowds weren't too bad either, and the Fastpass system works well, although by early evening there are no Fastpass tickets for the major rides left, so we suggest you get a ticket for these ASAP.  You can't get more than one at the time!The park itself is spotless and the staff extremely pleasant. How refreshing!Getting there by train is pretty easy from Tokyo train station just take the local train on Keiyo line to Maihama (not the express). Come out the station & walk to the right. Free with a JR pass.We thoroughly recommend a visit here for small kids & big ones too!!"
2753,5,14-Apr,Japan,awesome day with family,"this is a must do if you're visiting tokyo with family or even friends. it's a complete fantasy land here and leave all your life's stress and worries behind. the life at disney land is cute and colourful and the architect is magnificent. the creatures and animals, and cartoon characters and rides all come to life. great experience!"
2754,3,14-Apr,United Kingdom,Be prepared to QUEUE - rides overrated,"We got a two day pass to visit Disney land and Disney sea and I have to say sea is ten times better. We made the mistake of going at a school holiday - don't do this! Or a weekend! It was crazy busy. Japanese people seem to be used to waiting, 2-3 hours is nothing!, where as we really struggled with this. They have a fast pass system but you need to get there 40 mins before opening, queue and strategy plan to make the most of it. Also everyone runs as soon as  the gates open! It's crazy!The rides weren't anything too great and the food fairly over priced."
2755,4,14-Apr,Saudi Arabia,Tokyo Disneyland - the Domestic Market Rules,"We spent four days at Disneyland and Disney Sea last week. It was a school holiday (Sakura) in Japan, and the place was crowded.We arrived at 7:30 to get into Disneyland and we were among about 3,000 other people. Although the gates opened at 8:00, we got in at 8:30. We headed for the Winnie the Pooh ride to get Fast Passes, but the lineup for those were over an hour. Instead we went on It's a Small World and then to the Haunted House. Disneyland serves the domestic Japanese market and they LOVE it. The park was packed with waits being between 30 minutes for things like the carousel and about 3 hours for Winnie the Pooh at peak. In the stores, clothing is widely available, but there is nothing branded Tokyo Disneyland Resort, such as you would find at any of the other Disneys. However, there are a lot of other funky t-shirts and accessories that are unique - just not branded.Overall, I would go again - but am glad it wasn't my first Disney to get to (we have been to every Disneyland in the world)."
2756,3,13-Aug,Australia,Crowded but fun,"If you go to Tokyo Disneyland in the summer you can expect it to be crowded and hot, with long lines everywhere. This isn't to say you can't have fun though!Going early, i.e. when the park opens, is the best way to get on your favourite rides, and taking advantage of the FastPass system is almost a necessity to avoid waiting in long queue's in the hot sun - few rides have sheltered lines.It is still essentially Disney and aimed more at younger (& smaller) kids. Worth a full day, don't try doing DisneySea in the one day - if you can only do one, DisneySea is better!"
2757,4,14-Feb,Taiwan,"Tokyo Disneyland is for kids, but great souvenir that's Tokyo only","I've went to Disneyland in California and Hong Kong, and I've never been to Tokyo Sea land, but i can say the classic Disneyland here is for kids. There are not a lot of ride compare to others, that's why the line is crazy ALL DAY LONG, the fast pass to popular ride will be out before 11 am, so you have to make sure you go there early if you want the ride, or i suggest you relax, take plenty of picture and buy bunch of souvenirs. Talking about souvenir, Tokyo Disneyland has the most adorable and exquisite souvenir among Disneyland around the world, from iron cookie jar, to cartoon character mug, it's cute and some of them are Tokyo only. Even each pop corn stand have their own character box you can collect. I want to bring EVERYTHING home! So, forget about the ride, just enjoy Disney wonder, and buy lots of it home."
2758,1,14-Mar,United Arab Emirates,Worst Disney experience ever,"The park was so full that they should have stopped selling tickets and turned away people. I have visited all the Disney parks in the world and this is the first time that I saw attractions with waiting times up to 3h30 minutes!  Even to buy food, snacks at the karts, there were queues up to 20 minutes! Incredible. We had a fast pass for Space mountain but despite this, we still had to wait 45 minutes! That's rather more of a slow pass than a fast pass! For almost 50 euros, that's greed Mr.Disney and a nightmare rather than 'dreams coming true'!I would strongly recommend anyone going to ask prior to buying the tickets how many visitors Are already inside and to see waiting times at attractions. On a positive note, we would like to thank Ishii from the horseshoe restaurant in frontier land (or cowboy land as I think they call it in Tokyo). She was wonderful, made sure we were well looked after and went out of her way to help us. She should definitely be commended for being so friendly. "
2759,5,13-May,United States,Another Disney gem,"Every time I go to Tokyo I pay a visit either to Disney Sea or Disneyland, and I always love it.  Crowded, sometimes too many people to walk around, but it is very well organized.  You need to take advantage of the fast pass to be able to go the favorite rides.  Shopping is great, you find many products available only in Japan."
2760,2,14-Feb,Japan,Grossly overcrowded,"We went as a family mid week, and the queues for almost everything were ridiculous. We arrived in the morning, having stayed right next door at the Hilton Tokyo Bay (which was great - see my separate review).We got into ""It's A Small World"" relatively quickly (by which I mean less than 30 minutes).Apart from that... the only thing we managed to see was Snow White, which we queued about 90 minutes for. The ride lasted about 4 minutes... And had a warning sign, towards the front of the queue, about ""a witch"", but was actually almost completely full of ""scary"" things. My two daughters both ended up crying at the end and didn't enjoy the experience.We did a lot of walking, looking around for something we could actually enjoy together and not have to wait hours for... Occasionally some of the architecture (if it warrants being called that) was impressive in some sense. But there were no other rides where we felt there was any point waiting though, as the queues were ridiculous - even the simple merry-go-round had a queue indicating a 90 minute wait. This was nothing any of us were prepared to do, particularly when it was obvious the ride was really nothing special.We were able to get lunch without much queuing, but only by eating very early.We ended up leaving at about 2 pm even though we could have theoretically stayed many more hours.I had some mild enjoyment from seeing other people apparently having fun - even though my family and kids weren't.I have chosen ""more than 3 hours"" for recommended visit length mostly because any less and you may not get to go on any rides at all. For us though 3 hours was more than enough and we were happy to leave and get on with the rest of our holiday."
2761,5,13-May,United States,Better than America's Disneyland!,"My family has visited Tokyo Disneyland 3 times and we absolutely love it.  Disneyland Anaheim is great too, but the Japanese people really have the service piece down to perfection.  Every person we met was jovial and helpful, and always sent us off with an, ""Itteirashai!!"" which loosely means, ""Take care!"" Everything that you would expect from a Disneyland experience is amplified because the service of every single staff member is impeccable.  Seriously.  All the rides and attractions are well kept and our kids LOVED, Pooh's Hunny Pot Round Up (I think thats what its called...).  We needed to travel about an hour or so to get there, but everything was great.If you are a little adventurous, and love Disney, I would highly suggest a trip to Tokyo Disneyland!!!"
2762,5,14-Mar,Russia,More old-fashioned but still a timeless classic,"It seems like the original Disney Land is more popular than the new and high-tech-everything-is-possible Disney Sea park. I guess people are still in love with the good old Disney characters and classic rides, and that castle with princesses. We figured we can get on most rides later in the evening, without waiting in lines very long, so we just enjoyed the park walking around during the day, watching the parades, getting some fast passes, and doing all the rides in the evening. Loved the light-up parade, so beautiful and happy! Got princess dresses for our daughter, very nicely made and pretty inexpensive for that quality of making. Loved the new Winnie The Pooh ride, our daughter still keeps talking about it, just feel like we were in a crazy cartoon world where you turn into a cartoon :) It took us a day and a half to see everything we wanted to see, walk all over the place and ride all the rides we wanted to ride. I'd still love to do it again though!"
2763,5,13-Dec,United Arab Emirates,Happiest Place On Earth!,"This is the 3rd Disney franchise we have visited (Hong Kong, Paris, Tokyo) and all we can say is -  the happiest place on earth! It's just so magical being inside Disney. Everything is very beautiful, the staff are friendly, the rides are awesome and the gift shops are marvelous.One day is not enough to explore the whole place at a leisure pace. We visited last December 2-3, 2013 during the weekday. We were there until the park closed and for us, it wasn't enough. there should be more. We managed to watch the Electrical Light Parade and the fireworks and everything was simply amazing. We were there in the morning an hour after the parked opened and waited for it to close just to enjoy the whole magical place before we headed to Shinjuku in the morning. I will definitely recommend that you come as a family. It's more fun! Also, go there during weekdays because it can get very crowded during weekend. We were there on a weekday and yet, it was crowded with school kids and lots of families enjoying the nice, cold winter weather.Book for 2 days because there is another theme park - Tokyo Disney Sea. If you can afford to stay 3 days, then do so. Prolong that happy feeling!"
2764,5,13-Oct,Australia,Fantastic experience,"I'd been to Disneyland & Disneyworld in the USA as a child, so was looking forward to revisiting it with my 8 year old daughter some 40 years down the track!It was fabulous.  Language was no problem & it was just a magical experience for us all.We were lucky enough to be there for the 30 year celebrations AND for Halloween.  While normally only kids are allowed to dress up as Disney characters - because it was Halloween anyone could do so - so the park was full of adults in their full regalia of Disney characters.  This not only contributed to a real carnival atmosphere - but was also great for the kids, as they didn't have to line up to have their photos taken with 'real' Disney characters - we could just pick anybody & ask for a photo.  To the kids they were all Disney characters!Get there early to avoid big lines for the major rides & then mix up using the fast pass system & catching some of the live shows to fit in as many rides as possible.  We had a 4 day pass to Tokyo Disney & Disney Sea - so after watching the parades once, we found it easy to then get on some of the big rides when everyone else was watching the parades."
2765,5,13-Apr,Japan,Unforgettable Experience ...,"Was my first trip to Disneyland, it was a trip to remember... I wish day had more hours as 1 day is not enough but it was well worth ... the (staff) Characters Mickey ‚Äì Minnie ‚Äì Goofy - Daisy were lovely and kind enough to take pictures with me and my girlfriend and we really didn‚Äôt feel like leaving Disneyland ... it‚Äôs a life time memory and experience. I would suggest anyone to have Disney Experience once in a Lifetime, you won‚Äôt regret it.I would love to try Disney Sea next time which is next to Disneyland."
2766,5,14-Mar,United States,Wonderful atrraction,The park was huge and it would take you about 2 days to see everything.  The Disney show was amazing...you should definitely catch it.  The rides were good but takes about 20-30 mins to queue up for a 30sec-1min ride.  The day was very well spent.  Lots of great souvenirs to buy too!
2767,3,N/A,Philippines,A fun but bot so fun day,"Upon entering Tokyo Disneyland you will see nicely designed buildings like in mainstreet USA. There were a lot of people on the day we visited so the lines on rides are terribly long! We went to get fast passes for pooh's hunny hunt first since we have kids in the group and its one of the main attraction in tokyo disneyland. We rode peter pan ride which is quite fun and exciting, I enjoyed it and so was the eleders and kids.After,we ate our lunch at a pizza place near big thunder mountain, the food was not that good. Then we went to big thunder mountain, the line was loooonng that we waited 3 hours to have our ride, It was a good ride but its the reason why we didnt get enough tine to check out other attractions. And at last its pooh's hunny hunt time where we can finally feel like VIP with our fast passes. We got to the kart and then the ride started. BUT THEN the ride STOPPED and we were escorted out by the cast members for reasons we dont know because we cannot understand the japanese announcement and the cast members dont speak english. It was really dissappointing that we didnt get the chance to finish the ride. We went home after that. Oh! We also watched the parade which is totally Fantastic!:)By the way, if anyone from disney can read this please limit the number of people allowed to go in everyday in your themeparks so people would get most from their tickets especially for those tourists coming from other places. "
2768,4,13-Sep,India,Tokyo Disneyland,"this is one of four disneyland i heard and visited with family, it is really worth to visit this place, this is one day trip and full enjoyable with well managed japanese system"
2769,5,13-Apr,United Kingdom,Two parks for the price of one,"We were lucky enough to get a package that allowed us to stay for two days, probably the right amount of time to enjoy both parks, although Disneyland is better than Disney Sea. The whole family enjoyed both parks, it wasn't too busy when we went, very child friendly. longest we queued was 20 mins. Would defo recommend you take either park in, as both are as enjoyable as each other."
2770,5,13-Dec,Singapore,Tokyo Disneyland,"My daughter enjoyed her day here which is suitable for an 8 yr old. Now she is hooked and asking me to bring her here again. Long queue but can be quite fast. We tried taking the popular rides during the parade. Queue a bit shorter. True place, rides and toilets are clean. Will be back for more. "
2771,3,14-Mar,Japan,LINES LINES LINES,"As you may have guessed from the title, the lines are long. We went on a tuesday and you still had to wait 40-90min each ride. I also think that the bus schedules could be readjusted, the last bus back to Shinjuku is scheduled for 2040 and the fireworks display starts at 2030? All the souvenir shops sell the same souvenirs.."
2772,5,N/A,New Zealand,Disney Japan style,Came with my mother (there isn't a category for that). Once getting over the initial shock of so many people the day went in a bit of a blur. Felt safe. Everyone is very polite even after waiting for up to and hour before a parade. Make your visit more than two days which allows you to pace yourself and go back to your hotel for a bit of time out. This is definitely NOT the same experience as a Disney USA.
2773,3,14-Feb,Indonesia,Give up with the crowd,"Tokyo Disneyland was my first visit of any Disneyland, arrive in here around 11AM, this place already crowded, especially with students and families (Japanese mostly). I tried to have my first fast track ticket , fyi Disneyland provide schedule fast track that you can reserve, after the first attempt of fast track ticket u need to wait for almost 2hrs and because of the crowd i only got 1 fast track and others has been sold out.Quite tiring que for almost 40-90 mins for one attraction, also audio mostly in Japanese, i don't understand at all, the most entertaining was only the special show night parade.I do like those, but i still think nice place for kids :)"
2774,4,14-Mar,Australia,Japan loves Disney,"Third times a charm at Tokyo Disneyland.So glad I was there for its 30th Birthday celebrations. The place is awesome and a near replica of Magic Kingdom Florida. I agree with other reviews, the lines are long but get there early and get a fast past for the key rides. The new Revamped Star Tours is excellent. The parade is wonderful. The fireworks could have been longer. Just watch the Japanese shop... It's mayhem. Roll on the 40th Birthday!!"
2775,3,14-Feb,Malaysia,Great place to have fun (minus the crowd and long queue),"We went to disneyland on monday with hope there won't be too many crowd. But the place is full with people and we didn't enjoy much of the rides since the queue is about 90-120 mins. Most of the time, we walked around and took photos. Overall, it is very a nice place. Love the cinderella castle and all beautiful details. And we like the evening parade from all disney characters. But we missed the magical night parade."
2776,2,13-Oct,South Korea,Disappointing,"We visited Disneyland on a week day towards the end of October, I've got to say that I was not impressed. The whole place was packed with people, the queues were ridiculously long (90 mins was the minimum wait time for every ride), the price of food was extortionate and most of the rides were unimpressive and limited. Considering it was during the week and not a particularly nice day, I was shocked at how crowded it was; I've been to Hong Kong Disneyland on a beautiful summers day and the maximum wait time was 30 minutes. There are more shops than anything else, and the prices are horrendous - even by Japanese standards. If there was one redeeming feature, after you've been queuing for nearly 2 hours, the 2 minutes on the rides are somewhat enjoyable. We ended up leaving at 5.30 as both of us were feeling irritated by the barging passers by, the lines and there being nowhere to even sit down and relax."
2777,5,14-Feb,Indonesia,Joyfull Experience,"Despite mainly japanese language use in the Disneyland Tokyo, but it wont stop us to enjoy the park.The staff is friendly, always keep smilling and helpfull even they only know little english language.Overall we enjoyed our visit to Disneyland Tokyo and we bring plenty Cheerfull memory back home and hope u will also the same."
2778,3,14-Feb,India,Do not go here on a weekend,"We happened to visit Disneyland on a weekend. There were huge queues for each ride though it was chilling. We were there for only 2 weeekends, so we had no way of pushing our trip to disney. But was amazed to see there were so many poeple out there in the cold wind.Rates are atrocious, specially for the disney goods. Even for the food, that too after you stand in a long queue. Good - The disney parade at noon. Its a small world ride. I had heard the parade at night is also pretty good and should not be missed, but it was so cold that we could not think of waiting there for another hour."
2779,3,N/A,Malaysia,Okay Only,"I heard lots of good thing about Disneyland Tokyo in the past but however is was just so so. Is basically waste of time and money! As we are paying so much for the entrance fee, each game we need to wait at least 2hrs. Hong Kong and Paris are much better. "
2780,3,14-Feb,United States,Crazy crowds,"Went there in late February and the place was so crowded the waiting times were ridiculous. 140 minutes for Space Mountain? No thank you. As such, the experience was less than enjoyable as I mainly took the kiddy rides (with waiting time of an hour or less) which I don't really fancy and cannot really appreciate. The queues for the mascot were also ridiculous and at times, the food vendors as well.I would suggest making full use of the Fast Pass which you can get one every two hours and get to cut the queue. I got really irritated waiting for Haunted Mansion as the staff let all the Fast Pass people in first, making the queue move abysmally slow even though the ride capacity was huge. I am okay with letting them in first, but the ratio of Fast Pass people to normal queue people is ridiculous.Nevertheless, I recommend the Winnie the Pooh and the Star Wars ride. Also, go (only) during offpeak periods."
2781,5,14-Jan,Australia,Don't miss the Dreamlights show!,"A middle aged woman, I went alone on Tuesday the 28th of January and I had a wonderful time!The crowd predictor had suggested not huge crowds but, with ticket in hand, it took 30 minutes to get through the gate.I timed my day around the shows on offer.The Dream lights show at night was AMAZING, many lit floats, with their lights changing colours as they passed.Don't miss it! The crowd control for this and the afternoon parade was strict.The front section is for sitting only.I stood behind and had a wonderful view.The daytime parade Happiness is Here is also good but eclipsed by the light spectacular of the evening show.I also saw One Man's Dream and Minnie o Minnie, both excellent shows and lots of fun.The Mickey's Philharmagic 3D film was fun too.The day I went opening hours were limited to 10 am to 7pm but I still  had time to go on quite a lot of rides.I had a fast pass for Pooh's Honey Hut but I thought it was only okay.I also went on Pinnochio, Snow White,It's a Small World, Pirates of the Caribbean,Star Tours and I survived Space Mountain with my eyes shut.I liked the Haunted Mansion and took advice I'd read to stand near its entry to watch the afternoon parade and then just walk onto the ride when the parade passed.I had lunch at the Blue Bayou, overlooking the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.Food quite good, good service and very atmospheric.I didn't have to wait long, at 4pm!Tip: The lady selling tickets asked me if I was over 45 and gave me a discount!"
2782,1,14-Feb,Australia,Total waste of a day,"Just got back from Tokyo Disney. Total let down. Got to park at 12 noon and all of the fast passes had already ran out, so had to wait 2 hours in a queue to get on a ride. This was on a Wednesday! Totally over crowded. I was there for 7 hours and managed to get on 3 rides. Very badly organised and totally wasted my valuable travelling time. Seriously don't bother... Save your money and go to Florida... They have it mastered. This place took the magic out of Disney "
2783,4,14-Feb,Australia,Great shows!,"This was my first visit to Tokyo Disneyland and I have to say it was a great day out. First of all the shows at Tokyo Disneyland are amazing. Try and see as many as you can especially One Man's Dream. The dancers are spectacular and the sets and costumes just beautiful. Also make sure you check out Philharmagic, it is all in Japanese but you don't really need the language to understand what is going on and The Enchanted Tiki Room, make sure you pick up the subtitles from a cast member on the way in. Both of these shows were great fun.The parade was amazing. I could not believe how many lights were on the floats. The dancers, princesses and other characters were just beautiful to watch and it really was the highlight of the day.The day we went to the park it closed early (6pm). I was a bit dissapointed at first, as normally it closes much later but in the end it was more than enough time to get through the park. We also went in winter and as soon as the sun went down it was so cold I was glad to be going home. Check the website for park opening hours as they do fluctuate quite a bit depending on the day and season."
2784,4,13-Dec,Australia,Disneyland Tokyo,The rides and restaurants and parades were fantastic as it was Chrismas time.  Very crowded everywhere but we managed to access most of the rides we wanted to.
2785,5,14-Feb,China,Fun for the Kids,You spend 1-2 days to cover all the attractions with your Children. Please check however for closure of some of the rides available as it was not available on the web. The new attraction Star Wars is great but queue is long. Get the Fastpass! I was there just before Chinese New Year and the crowd was manageable. The race car track was short compared to the HK Disneyland. Price of food was reasonable. 
2786,5,14-Feb,N/A,It's Disneyland! The same as what you'd experience elsewhere.,"Tokyo Disney is just as awesome as other Disney's around the world. It's layout is pretty similar to Disney Paris and it still has all the magic that you'd expect. It costs 6200 yen for a day passport (around $62) and is easily accessible from Tokyo. If you are looking to save cash I wouldn't stay in a Disney hotel I'd just choose a hostel in the city and go from there. You will also want to have as long as possible there so make sure you get there for opening time. It's really easy to get to just take a train from the city. It should be mentioned that Tokyo's rail system is a little confusing. There are 2 main lines, 'JR' and 'Tokyo metro', it may be cheaper not to buy a day rail pass if you have to travel on a mixture of JR and metro trains because you can only use the day pass with the applicable rail company. It's very easy to see which company is which as 'JR' has a 'JR' logo and 'Tokyo Metro' has a fancy 'M'. You can either buy the tickets online in the form of an e-ticket (easiest way if you don't live in Japan or speak Japanese), or you can pay to get them delivered (only to Japanese addresses) or you can buy one from a combini Loppi machine. A loppi machine is the red atm-like machine that sits in the corner of most combinis (you will need some Japanese to do this though). Food wise Tokyo Disney isn't cheap, but it's Disneyland so that's expected. The park has lockers and an outdoor picnic area so if you fancy having a picnic you can lock your stuff up and come back later. The lockers are big and should be able to take suitcases too if you need to bring them to the park. Be warned however that you need to pay for every time you open them. When you enter the park your bags will be checked, you're not allowed to bring in any outside food or drink. However the checks were very lax..................."
2787,5,13-Sep,Australia,"Definitely worth a visit, but get in early",Tokyo Disneyland is great! It's confusing to get to. You need to change to the JR line. Entry fee is pretty cheap (around $60) but make sure you definitely get the fast pass because the lines are insanely long!
2788,5,13-Nov,Australia,A great attraction,"Tokyo Disneyland is easily accessible from the JR Line at Maihama station. The entry fee is ¬•6200 for adults, so is fairly reasonable. It is best to go on a school/work day and arrive before 10am as the lines would not be that long. As soon as you go in, make sure you get a fastpass to any ride as lines can sometimes be long throughout the day. It is best to go on rides during the 3pm parade. Food is not very expensive and is reasonable compared to other Disneyland parks. Highlights included the Dreamlights Parade, Splash Mountain and Thunder Mountain. Overall, definitely worth a visit."
2789,5,14-Jan,China,Book a Disney hotel room through their official web site,"It is very convenient to make reservations at their official web site.  You have privilege to nake reservations on restaurants and entertainment lunch or dinner shows as online reservation guests. Despite the 15 minutes early entry at designated gates to the parks,  you may choose to join the 3 hours premium tours to avoid long queues at some attractions. (no need to rush for the fast passes but you will enjoy much shorter waiting time through the fast pass lanes as the cast member wil bring you straight in!)  You may reserve through phone calls only in case your reserve online for a hotel room."
2790,4,14-Jan,Brazil,Just like Paris Disneyland,"Tokyo Disneyland is just like Paris Disneyland in number of attractions, shoppings and restaurants. It's not big as Florida Disney World. But you can find good attractions: 4D theaters (mickey phillamagic, captain EO by michael jackson), roller coaster (big thunder), simulator (space tours)"
2791,5,13-Apr,Japan,Great Attraction Place!,An great attraction place who love Disney Characters! It is bit crowded so i don't recommend people going on Saturday or Sunday's but this is one of the place you should go if you have visited Chiba or if you are a Disney fan!
2792,3,14-Jan,Australia,Not so great for teenagers,"Having been to Anaheim, Tokyo Disneyland was a bit disappointing.  It was a bit 'tame'  for teenagers and they got bored quickly (didn't even make it for a full day).  The q's were very long and often not worth the wait.  We still had fun though and think if our kids were younger and we hadn't been to Anaheim we might have appreciated it a bit more."
2793,4,14-Jan,Malaysia,Nice Park with Super Long Queue,"We've spent almost 7 hours there from 12.30pm - 7.00pm (Saturday) but we've managed to enjoy only 3 rides due to super long queue. We went to Hong Kong Disneyland before, but this one is bigger and better.PROS- Many Disney characters roam the park, make it easier to pose with them.- 'Fast Pass' machine available but still need to wait long.- The park is very clean and the staff are friendly.CONS- Lines can frequently run over two hours for major attractions.- Expensive foods inside the park and no Halal foods for Muslim.- It was too crowded even during the winter.My advice, try to avoid weekend or school holiday whether it's Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter or Earthquake or you'll end up disappointed like me."
2794,5,14-Jan,Australia,Wonderful Disney day,"We have taken the kids to Hong Kong Disney and Anaheim Disney in California so were a bit concerned Tokyo Disney may have disappointed - we need not have worried.  The children had a blast enjoying all the well known rides, Splash mountain, Space mountain, Frontierland.  They did it all at least once and rode a few of them multiple times.  Yes, there were queues throughout the day, but that is part of any day at Disneyland and the kids didn't seem to mind. The park and staff were of the same high standard that you expect from Disneyland, everything was very clean and very well organised and most staff we encountered spoke some english. Getting out to Disneyland from central Tokyo was relatively straightforward, we took a train from Tokyo station which took us about 15 minutes, the train was full of kids and adults alike dressed up in their Disney costumes, clearly excited about their day ahead. Well worth a visit if you have young children and time allows, expect a huge turnout at the gates at opening time.Note: We tried to purchase online e-tickets the day before our visit but the website would not accept our foreign credit cards."
2795,5,13-Sep,Turkey,Tokyo Disneyland,"Sheraton Grande Tokyo Bay Hotel is a luxurious 4-star property conveniently located near the centre of Urayasu. Local places of interest include Tokyo DisneySea, Disneyland Tokyo and Tokyo International Exhibition Centre (Tokyo Big Sight). Other points of interest are Odaiba, Ariake Coliseum and Venus Fort. "
2796,5,13-Oct,China,All for the Parade!,"Before arrived Japan, you could not imagine how their people enjoy the parade. In disneyland, they will show you! Some of them just sit there at good spot with good view. Talk there and eat there just waiting for the Parade. When it's coming, they would interacts with the actors with high warmth. So, come earlier to find a spot if you wanna enjoy the parade with good view! But, yes, the Disney Parade in Tokyo is quite good! I think it's better than Hongkong, especially the party atmosphere there.....they would be your good memories if you have been there....."
2797,3,14-Jan,N/A,Enjoyable day but a bit dated,"We went on what was meant to be one of the quietest days of the year (school and work re-commenced after New Year holiday) and it was still too busy. A 2 hour wait on Splash Mountain all day and fast passes gone very early. Luckily wait was worth it, Splash Mountain was the best ride and Poohs Honey Hunt surprisingly good. Many rides are just outdated and too lame considering technology today. "
2798,4,13-Sep,Japan,A little bit for kids,Since I've been to Disneyland in Anaheim before I feel that Tokyo Disneyland+Disneysea = Anaheim's Disneyland. Disneyland in Tokyo feels like it is mainly for young kids and I had more fun in Disneysea more than this one.
2799,3,13-Dec,Australia,Would be fun if the crowds were smaller,"It is Disneyland and has most of the main attractions you'd expect (though smaller than the LA one). So from that point of view, if you've never been to Disneyland and are keen to go, it is worth it just for the experience.However, the lines are enormous!! When we got there at 9am, lines for the most popular rides were already over 200 minutes!!! When we tried to use our fast passes at about 9:30am, the earliest available time for some of those rides was about 7-8pm at night. Even getting popcorn meant standing in line for 20 minutes or so.I think in LA Disneyland there were Disney characters walking all around that you could get photos with, etc (I went as a kid many years ago). In Tokyo, you have to line up for about 10mins or so in one of only a couple of spots where Mickey and others make brief appearances - fine for us as adults, but pretty slack for little kids. Even the gift shops were incredibly crowded.There is a parade (I think around 2pm or so) which is worth seeing.In short: If you've never been to another Disneyland and are keen, you may as well. Otherwise, don't go and expect to do more than 1-2 rides and much else the entire day, other than push through crowds."
2800,5,13-Feb,Japan,the DREAMLAND,You should go here if came to Tokyo with much effort.Some Japanese people come here many times even if they live in distant areas though.See the Electrical Parade show at night.
2801,4,14-Jan,Indonesia,Good but too long Queues!,"Many to rides and a nice place to have fun but completely over crowded, arrive at 11.00 and the fast passes only available for 20.00 hrs !! So what to do if it like this, enjoy the culinary or just enjoy the popcorn tasting for curry, caramel, black pepper and many others but you have to go quick too otherwise a heavy queue also in the popcorn stand."
2802,4,13-Dec,Singapore,"Lots of rides, shows & long Queues!",Lots of things to do there but the Qs were really long. Do download an app to check out the Q timing were possible as this would allow for better planning.  The Pirates of Caribbean ride was good as it had a section that was from the movie.  
2803,4,13-Oct,Spain,"A great Disney experience, but way too crowded","Disneyland Tokyo is a must for Disney lovers, but not a must for first time visitors to Japan. Give it a chance if you have one day to spare. Disneyland Tokyo is a really beautiful place, with a lot of attractions, but so crowded by Japanese that it is really stressful. FastPasses run out extremely quickly, and some attractions have an average queue of 2 hours, a big con. Do not expect to go to the SpaceMountain without waiting +1 hour. So you will spend the whole day and probably miss some attractions. We were there on Halloween, so it was a great experience because of the additional ornaments. Japanese are always very attentive, so that was a plus too. Pop corn is sold in several alternatives (salty, curry, caramel, soy, etc.) so try them. Another big plus is the quality of the fast food, really above any fast food I have tried in any theme park. Entrance fee is 6200 YEN (62 USD), so much cheaper than Orlando's."
2804,2,14-Jan,United Kingdom,Not a patch on Florida. Rather disappointing!,"We spent 1 day at Disneyland Tokyo and although it was a fun day out it was definately second rate compared to Disney Florida and California, The rides were OK but rather old fashioned and the Disney atmosphere and magic seemed to be missing. The light show and fireworks at the end of the evening were very disappointing and not worth waiting for. I have seen better at small village firework displays in UK."
2805,1,14-Jan,Australia,Give it a Miss,"I know we went just after new year, but you could't move there was so many people, I have never seen so many people in one place.  3 - 4 hour Wait in lines for rides, 1.5 hour wait for popcorn, 45 minutes for toilet.  Have been to Disneyland in LA and this was much, much more crowded.  Not enjoyable at all.  They should limit the number of people who can enter, to allow for those who do get in to have a chance of enjoying themselves.  Shocking Experience!!!!!!!!  Never Again.  Ever."
2806,5,13-Jun,United States,Must do in Japan!,"Who doesn't love Disneyland!?!? My husband and I visited in June and the lines were long but it was expected since it was the summer. The park seemed smaller than the one in California but still plenty of rides and attractions. There were a lot of characters walking around which was fun! Also, there were a ton of popcorn vendors in both Disneyland and the Sea Park. This is totally different from the Disneyland in California and they had different popcorn vendors including soy sauce."
2807,2,13-Nov,Australia,Don't waste your time,"Too many people! Just like you are in a gigantic pool of people plus millions of strollers.Minimum wait for a ride is 45mins.  Most of them are over 90mins (longest was 130mins at that day).  At the day we went, there were only one photo time (about 30mins) with the Disney characters. You can image how long the queue was and how many people(mainly kids) were disappointed at the end. We had to miss the main parade because we were half way in the queue to a ride where we had been waiting for 30 mins.  Will you give it up at that point? The night parade was fantastic!  It was the only highlight of the day because the highly expected fire work was cancelled due to the windy condition (another big disappointment!) Since you are there, you should try their burger meal.  The price was reasonable (900 yen) and the burger bread was cute.  Maybe we are spoiled by the theme parks on the Gold Coast, short queues (max 45min, even in school holiday), many character photo times, many different rides that suite different ages.  Just bring your own food because the food and drinks are supper expensive ^_^"
2808,4,13-Dec,Malaysia,Very good experience despite the crowd. Recommended attraction!,"Let's be fair in our reviews of this place, so here are the cons first.I agree that this park is ridiculously crowded with majority the locals who probably own annual passes. My family & I visited on a Mon (supposedly a school day too), & it was really crowded (at least 10x more ppl compared to Disney HK IMO).Queues were up to 150mins for major attractions & at least 30mins for smaller rides. Only managed to grab 1 Fastpass (no extra $ involved) for Pooh's Hunny Hut at around 9.45am & it was already for 4pm! I gave up trying for any more Fastpasses as the queue at Pooh's already took us 1/2 hr.U'd even have problem finding seats at the food outlets, so crowded everywhere!Souvenir items were extremely pricey but I guess this was comparable to other theme parks of this standard. All the shows were in Japanese.U can forget about taking pictures with the characters especially Mickey & Minnie. The queues were just tooo long! Besides, the park is so big that the meet & greet areas were quite out of they way if you had already been passed earlier.Ok, now for the pros! The whole park is just Happiness personified! Once u step in, u are drowned in feel good songs, beautiful/colourful decors, and greetings & smiles from all the staff members. Even the cleaners & toilet attendants were extra cheerful & friendly.Dont be put off by the crowd! Although there were long queues everywhere, they moved fast & u dont really feel the wait. A Q sign could be for 50mins, but in fact only 30mins was required. We arrived at the park at 9.00am, left at 6.00pm, & managed to cover the whole park & get on 8 rides/attractions. But we had to miss Monsters Inc! Some rides you could skip unless you're with kids, eg Snow White & Pinocchio.The parades were nice, but the fireworks were just so-so (we saw this from Maihama train station after having dinner at Ikspiari).F&B prices were reasonable, the Turkey leg fantastic! Pls pass on the caramel popcorn, a total let down & not worth the JPY300. One good thing at Disneyland Tokyo is that they dont check for F&B in your bags. We saw lots of the locals & tourists eating from their own bentos/containers. There were water fountains everywhere, u dont hv to spend on drinks at all.Although attractions in Japanese, most of their staff members speak at least basic English & are extremely helpful.The park was noticeably less crowded by 4pm (it gets dark earlier in winter). So if u wanna avoid queuing too long at the rides, this was a good time to get on those u missed earlier.Overall still a very good experience & much recommended! Just go & have FUN!Last tip: Try & visit both Disneyland & Disneysea. Both are so different & one of a kind, but yet offer similar fun & excitement. Its also cheaper to buy a 2-day pass for both."
2809,5,13-Mar,Australia,Release your inner child!,"Disneyland is your dream come true! You can relive all of your childhood Disney adventures in Tokyo for hardly any money at all! The park layout is extremely easy to follow and copes with the higher influx of people very well in my opinion. Some of the more popular rides have longer waits, but for someone such as myself who isn't really into roller coasters and whatnot, the less popular rides suited me just fine! There really is something at Disneyland for all ages. The street vendors make amazing popcorn in dozens of flavors and the eateries are quite affordable. I didn't get to DisneySea, but from all accounts it is just as great. I would definitely recommend looking for an overnight package at the hotel to visit both, it really is a once in a lifetime opportunity."
2810,5,N/A,United States,Fabulous Fun!,"Disneyland and Disney Sea were simply amazing. Three super happy days filled with lots of adventure! The day and especially the night parades at both Disney locations are spectacular!! For the rides, some lines were long, but worth it!! There is also a fast pass which you can get which zips you through the lines. The shows were also great!! And a plus was the ease of access from hotel to park(s). "
2811,5,13-Dec,Singapore,Fabulous Cold Christmas,"Enjoy myself at Tokyo Disneyland, it was very cold- 5 degree & raining. Too bad they have to cancel the fireworks which was a disappointment. However, the lightings & the festive mood made the place lively & super place to be. Due to my health, hve chose to purchase the after 6pm ticket which cost 3300 yen. Not to miss when in Tokyo. U will surely hve a fantastic time."
2812,1,N/A,Australia,Not worth the long lines,"The most crowded theme park Ive ever been to. Spent an entire day there but only managed to get on two rides, lines for big rides average around 3 hours, minimum of 1 hour for even the smallest rides. Fast passes were all gone by 10am, totally not worth the 6200 yen. Your time and money would be better spent for a day of shopping in Akihabara. "
2813,4,13-Oct,Singapore,First time in an amusement park. WOW.,"This is my first time in an amusement park and the sheer size of it just blew me away.Though i've heard that the ones in US are much bigger, but this is still quite huge for me.Lots of locals in disney outfit just soaking in the fun. Service as expected from the japanese were impeccable. Take the ""single"" rider queues if you do not have to sit with friends. It will save you loads of time from queuing."
2814,4,13-Dec,Malaysia,Avoid Weekends and Public HOLIDAYS,Don't go during those time mention above unless you wanna queue up to 120mins for a ride....most suitable for kids and teenagers...not for old people...must try their Smoked Turkey Leg for only 500 yen...delicious and interesting...all signages and language spoken in Japanese...all for them...thats why so so successful..Buy 'Fast Pass' if no choice to aviod wasting precious time in queuing for the rides...700- 1000 yen each...
2815,5,13-Jul,Singapore,The only Disney park I will return to again and again!,"Fantastic attractions, organized queues, and polite and friendly local tourists -- Tokyo Disneyland is a joy! I think the only negatives I can say is that the attractions are all in Japanese language, but since I read and speak Japanese well enough (after living in Tokyo on and off for three years) this did not detract from my expereince at all. A MUST-SEE!"
2816,5,13-Dec,Singapore,Efficient and Pleasant Busy Park,"It may be crowded, but it's most pleasant to queue cause it moves very fast. Even the toilets are so well-organized. Initially i was intimidated by the long queue everywhere, but after 1-2 experiences, it scare me not anymore. Not only the characters, the staff and the park are fun, the japanese are also nice to 'watch'. They get into the mood very well, full gear of characers, from head gears, gloves, princess suit, pirate band, etc. It's a fun place to visit and service is good. Will go back again and again."
2817,4,13-Dec,Singapore,Brings out the child in everyone,"We visited the park on a weekday and though it was pretty crowded, we managed to go through most rides in less than an hour wait time.I think the parades are not to be missed.  It was pretty long but sure kept our eyes glued to it."
2818,1,13-Dec,United States,Worst Disney Property,"I have been to Disneyland and Disney Paris.  I am an annual passport holder at Disneyworld.  Tokyo Disneyland is the worst Disney experience I have ever had.  The lines are outrageously long.  For Toy Mania, the wait was 4 hours.  Space Mountain was 2.5 hours.  Fast Passes are gone very, very early in the morning.  The crowds are enormous. It is obvious the park is over-sold.  The monorail costs ¬•500 per ride.  The food and souvenir prices are outrageous.  Apathy only begins to describe the guest relations employees.  I want my money back!If you really wish to have a great Disney experience, go to Disneyworld in Florida, United States.  Tokyo Disney should be ashamed of itself."
2819,1,13-Dec,Japan,Too Many People. Longest Lines Ever.,"You do not want to go here if you are a foreigner. All you will see is a sea of Japanese people waiting for hours in line for even the most simple of rides. And don't forget you will be gouged to high heaven at any of the official hotels. Expect at least $500/night for substandard hotels. Expect to get on no more than 3 rides all day at DisneyLand.Place Sucks. if you are a fan of Disney, go to Hong Kong or back to the States.As I mentioned in last review of DisneySea, our hard working servciemen and women that I met here that had come from Guam with their families had just terrible experiences as things are too expensive and you get nothing but waiting in very long lines for your money. STAY AWAY."
2820,5,13-Dec,Thailand,Neat and Clean,"Our third time at the park and we found out that everything was neat and clean as usual. Though it rained, the park was crowded and everyone was patiently queued up. We planned to utilize 'fast pass' as much as we could, and it worked.We loved the smoked turkey leg (500 yen), but we felt that it was smaller than before, and almost half-size of the one offered in Orlando!"
2821,4,13-Dec,Thailand,"2nd visit to Tokyo Disneyland, not as impressed as the 1st time","Went to Tokyo Disneyland on December 9, 2013 (Monday). Decided to go on Monday to avoid crowd (like we did the first time) but this time there were a lot of people. We get to the park even before it opens and stayed up till it's closed. Average queuing time for each attraction was 45-90 minutes. Managed to get the kids on Buzz Lightyear twice (my son favorite), once each on  it's a small world, peterpan, phillar magic, pinocchio, caroussel, dumbo, pooh's hunny hunt (cant' miss it!), cartoon spin, pirates of the caribbean, monster inc. (lines long all day till closed), haunted house (with nightmare before christmas theme), jungle train and the jungle boat. Pretty much every kiddie rides there are. Oh, I also went on the new ride (the star tours) which was awesome; a cool simulation 3d ride. It was cold in the morning but turned out to be a nice day. Expect lots of people everyday in December. The staff here are awesome. They literally smile all day.TIPS:  If you are travelling with small kids who cannot get on the ride, tell the staff in front of that attraction that you want to do the parent swap and they will let one parent want in the front of the attraction with the kids while the other parent went in. And when the first parent came out, the staff will take the other parent through a secret back stage door and right to the ride (even faster than fast pass line)."
2822,5,13-Dec,Australia,Love this Disneyland,This is my favourte Disney Park.  It is designed so everyone can have a good time. The rides here do not leave you traumatised (eg. tower of terror)  it is all very tamed.Bring lots of money for nick Naks and popcorn.. can get expensive but so totally worth it!!
2823,5,13-Dec,Australia,Disneyland is awesome,"Disneyland is great.. You need to go in early as it is very crowded even during weekdays.. For some rides, had to stand in queue for more than an hour but it's worth the wait.. The quality of shows were amazing and the rides were unique and highly enjoyable.. A must visit in tokyo"
2824,3,13-Nov,Malaysia,Bad weather spoils it all,"It was very windy and cold when we visited causing both the night parade and fireworks show to be cancelled. The crowd has thinned out as the night wears on due to the freezing temperature. We visited using the after 6 passport, therefore only managed a few rides. Noticed that The Winnie the Pooh and Monsters Inc. attractions remained to have long queues."
2825,5,13-Dec,United Arab Emirates,The perfect theme park!,"We love Disneyland! We keep coming back whether it is in Paris, Hong Kong or Tokyo. We love the fact that both adults and kids can be actually kids in this place. There are so many rides and fun things to do. There are plenty of souvenir shops and eateries too so you can always have a rest after a long day of walking, picture-taking, riding in the park's various thrilling rides and watch the parades too."
2826,4,13-Dec,Singapore,Let your hair down and party with Mickey Mouse & Co.,"Visited Disneyland Tokyo for the first time with my wife and 3 year old daughter. Was expecting to be bored but ended spending the entire day having the time of my life while bonding with my child.There are plenty of attractions, food and street parades. You'll spend a lot of time in queues but once you get to go on your turn, you'll quickly forget about the waiting and have fun.Definitely recommended for anybody, both young and old."
2827,3,13-Dec,Australia,Nice,"This is a duplication of Anaheim Disneyland only missing 30% I guess, which is a bit odd considering it is 30 years old now.  Rides are average 100mins line up to get on. The Fastpass is only good for two rides as by 11.30am it allowed you to book a ride at 6pm.  The feel of like being in a stage show as Anaheim has is not in this place. Make sure you take lots of money as there is definitely shops shops shops.  Best pair of shoes too as you will be standing for a very very very long time.  PS I absolutely loved Anaheim Disneyland, out of 10 I would give it 11 This one is a possible 6"
2828,5,N/A,Malaysia,Dream Came True. ,"Childhood Fantasy came true. A lot of people around. Suggest taking the FastPass for a few rides. Took FastPass on Space Mountain which was Amazing. Then took FastPass for Big Thunder Mountain, very exiciting. Lots a food and stuff to buy according to themes. Staff are very friendly and there are lot of street parade so your never bored. A must go if you're in Japan. "
2829,5,13-Nov,United States,Can't go wrong with Disney!,"This was my first time ever at Disney and what bet place for my first experience than Tokyo. It was awesome. A little early for the Christmas decorations but I loved it. My husband said I had ""shiny ball syndrome"". I was amazed and felt like a kid again. I highly recommend going. This Disney is very busy in weekends so fast passes are the way to go. All theme parks in Japan are busier than any park in the US LOL "
2830,4,13-Nov,Australia,The happiest place on earth,Having visited Disneyland in California it is impossible to overlook the similarities of the two parks which are set up almost identically. All the major attractions are here. I was really impressed by the friendliness of the park staff who were polite and always smiling. It was immaculately clean. The length of the lines was a problem even with using the fast pass system. 
2831,5,13-Nov,Malaysia,Chasing the childhood dream,"Long queue if you're heading on Japanese's public holiday or sunday. Avoid it is a better choice, else try to get more fastpass and get to the park earlier."
2832,5,13-Apr,Philippines,A Japanese Disney Experience,"Disney anywhere is fun, providing an opportunity for both kids and adults alike to play and have fun. I particularly enjoyed the toy story ride.  Tokyo Disney offered a lot of fun and new experiences in a curiously japanese way."
2833,4,13-Oct,Singapore,Feel like a child again!,"Definitely recommend to go about an hour or so before opening to queue. Do some research before going and decide your fast pass strategy, which rides you want to take (in which order) and get your hands on a map prior if you can. Not all places that sell tickets have English maps so try to get it from your hotel or from any Disney ticketing area (there are several around the city) so you can have a proper look at the layout and do some notations. Eat or bring along a good breakfast. I felt that most of the food was junk food. I was staying at the nearby Sheraton and could return for a proper meal but it is inconvenient for everyone else who isn't staying at the Disney hotels. Wear comfy clothes and shoes. You are definitely going to stand for many hours on end so choose something cute and fashionable while comfy. There are many water points around the park, usually near a washroom, and sometimes along the queues for rides too, so just bring a water bottle to fill.Check what parades are on during your visit and the timings! The Japanese will wait in the designated areas in advance for a great view. It's a good chance to grab some food and chill on the ground. Bring a mat if you mind sitting on the floor. No standing allowed though - Fabulous rule that ensures everyone has a nice view. Don't forget to take the time to just enjoy the wonderfully designed surroundings, and take many photos! The Japanese love to dress up to go to Disneyland. Just give in to the temptation, buy a hat of your favourite character and join the fun!The popcorn bucket is something of a collector's item. Different areas have different designs so do some research to get the bucket you want with the flavour of popcorn you want. Refills are cheaper if you already have the buckets. My friend and I almost didn't go for the Winnie the Pooh's Hunny Hunt due to the crazy queues but went in the end and didn't regret it at all!Rides I REALLY enjoyed:Big Thunder Mountain, Splash Mountain, Pooh's Hunny Hunt, Space MountainRides I didn't enjoy:Captain EO (Please don't waste your 20 minutes of waiting + watching time here. The show was an absolute disappointment), Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters, Star Tours The Adventures ContinueRide that was closed:It's A Small WorldI was lucky to be there in October - There was the usual Main Street Electrical Parade, a Happiness Year Parade (to celebrate their anniversary) and a Halloween Parade!Fantastic stuff. Hope this wasn't too wordy. Would love to help more if anyone has questions!"
2834,5,13-Nov,United Kingdom,So much fun!,First Disney experience and it was amazing!Took 1 1/2 hours from Tokyo by train but then a 5 minute walk into the park.Tickets are reasonable and opened from 8.30am.We went just after the Christmas celebrations began and the decorations were amazing!The rides are exciting and some are very realistic (Pirates of the Caribbean).  On a weekday in November it was surprisingly busy. Queues about an hour each but plenty to watch with the parades.The people are so excited to be there and so are the staff!It is slightly expensive but no more so than any other theme park.Loved it and just wish we'd had time to visit Disney Sea too.
2835,5,13-Nov,Australia,Superfragacalalisticly Wonderful,"It took nearly 48 years to get to my 1st Disneyland and the fantasies of my childhood as I dreamed of what it would be like we're not to be disappointed! It truly is a magical place where just for a little while you can forget your normal life and enter into make believe, that actually becomes a reality. I read some jaded reviews about how long the lines for rides were etc, but that really was to be expected. Allow at least a full day and into the night to look around and if you want to really get a good look at everything and go on all the rides allow at least 2-3 days. Personally, I think Disneyland is wasted on the young... I can't wait to go back again."
2836,5,13-Aug,United Kingdom,Loved it!,"We were expecting huge queues and rain in August but we were pleasantly surprised.   Disneyland Toyko was amazing. Yes there were queues but the company hired enough staff to ensure all run smoothly. There were several members of staff in the lines, at the end of the lines and around the park. There was no queue jumping it was most orderly. Even when we queued for the parades everyone sat in their place, no one asked if their child could sit in-front of you, like we have experienced in every other Disneyland around the world. Pushchairs were not allowed, and had to be folded and put out of the way. The parades and shows were stunning. The queues for the characters, again was orderly, no one tried to push in. The whole of the park was clean, there was a sense of pride, there were enough members of staff picking up the litter but everyone I saw that accidentally dropped litter in a restaurant or fast food cafe picked it up. It was so clean. The members of staff that walked past you, regularly offered to take photos of you and your family and were just really nice and polite. We spend two days in the park and did all the rides, some several times and saw all the shows and parades. Definitely worth a visit, we will definitely go again."
2837,5,13-Jun,N/A,AMAZING,"I love Tokyo Disneyland. On some aspects, I like it better than Disneyland in Los Angeles. The staff is so friendly, the rides are great and well-maintained, the park is extremely fun, and there is a good selection of food options and snacks throughout the park. It is very busy on weekends, so I would recommend going on a weekday if possible. During the summer, they have an awesome promotion for ""natsu after 5 passports"" where you can enjoy the park from 5pm until closing, at a relatively inexpensive price, I've done this several times, and it can especially be worth it on a weekday when it isn't so busy. The park is also very easy to get to via public transportation."
2838,5,13-Oct,Brazil,Gotta love this place.,"This is Disney to the nth degree.  The Japanese people are over the top into Disney.  The Disney Sea park is the most amazing of their parks I've seen (we've been to all their parks except Hong Kong). The girls well into their 20's dress in character and it's truly something to see.  Only warning is since Japan has a six day school week, Sundays are crowded like nothing I've ever seen. If you ever get a chance you've got to see this place!"
2839,4,13-Oct,United Kingdom,Good day at Disney,"Myself and hubby visited Disneyland in October, the day after the typhoon. It was still a bit windy so the happiness is here parade was cancelled and there were nearly no characters out and about, disappointing, but understandable.As attendance was low, the longest we waited for any ride was about 25 minutes.the food was a challenge as we are strict vegetarians, but did enjoy the multiple flavours of popcorn.. the curry was the best!park was clean, folks were friendly and we had no problem with language.we did get to see the halloween parade and the electric parade and the fireworks (though ever since seeing Disney Dreams in Paris, I can't hear the song from Tangled without tearing up!)We were able to bring some of our own food in without a problem, and if you want a prime viewing spot , people take their places for parades etc  VERY early"
2840,5,13-Oct,N/A,Fantastic - We'll definitely go again.,"Extremely busy, despite the pooring rain. The Japanese use their theme park to the MAX! We saw men in suits on rides at 6-7pm - unreal. Always go expecting a crowd, it get insanely busy by 9.30am. And when you enter the park RUN to your first FastPass!!!! You CAN double up on FastPass's at the time specified on the ticket. Make sure you have your next FastPass in your pocket before joining a FastPass ride - we worked this out too late and missed two major attractions due to the 3 hour wait time! Oh, that's another thing, the wait times are ""Bang On"". If the sign says 180 minutes, then you'll be waiting 180 minutes. USE THE FASTPASS TO ITS FULL ADVANTAGE! With a FastPass you literally walk right to the front of the queue in a separate line and join in about 10m from the turn-styles - about 10 min wait. Amazing park all in all, it is like nothing we have in Australia and only about $50AUD per person to get in (10,500 Yen for a two day pass, it's roughly $105AUD). We got $200 air fares with JetStar and ridiculously cheap accom on Wotif, our whole trip cost less than $1500AUD for 3 nights for two people including spending money and a few gifts. It is also very cheap to eat in Tokyo, don't listen to other reviews. Often, we'd go to the ""hole in the wall"" type restaurants and eat for $5AUD each - that's main, soup and green tea for 5 bucks! Tokyo is CHEAP and the attractions are amazing. I can honestly say, I couldn't fly to the Gold Coast and get into the theme Parks there for a 4 day trip for less than $700 each! C'mon Australia, Disney's where its at! Just do it!"
2841,3,13-Sep,Japan,nice illumination,"I went to Tokyo Disney land in my summer vacation with my friend. Tokyo Disney land have some kind of tickets for example all one day ticket, after 6pm o‚Äôclock ticket, 2 days with lodging ticket etc. I think this various kind of tickets are point of Tokyo Disney land‚Äôs popularity. Then we selected after6 ticket because of summer. We thought that it is too tired to play in Tokyo Disney land one all day in very hot summer! We arrived at Maihama station, and walked to Disney land. There is a train in Tokyo Disney resort but we can go on foot, too. Then entrance of Disney land, there were too long line! So many! So I recommend that you have to come too early than opening time. Open the entrance, we were admitted! In summer night, there are fireworks! I really want to watch this, but we were in the middle of queuing for other attraction. Sometimes, if you have a big luck, you can see fireworks from corkscrew! It will be very unforgettable memory. In the night, parade‚Äôs light are very bright and make us take some picture! I did too! If you love illumination, please come to the Tokyo Disney resort. You can not only watch immovable illumination but also parading, moving illumination! Wonderful."
2842,5,13-Apr,N/A,What a great day!,"We decided a trip to Tokyo Disneyland would be a good way to spend one of our last days in Japan before heading home to Australia. Our expectations we were high but were still exceeded! We thought the price was good considering you pay one fee and are free to go on as many rides as many times as you like. The queues were quite long but you soon forget about that when you have experienced the tastefully done, beautiful rides. It was very spotlessly clean and the staff were very friendly. We loves Tokyo Disneyland :) "
2843,1,13-Nov,United States,Bad experience,"Bad day, first and last time in amusement park, 5 hrs in line 2 rides accomplished, never again. Totally stupid Cinderella castle 1 hr in line to be retold simplified version Cinderella/Pumpkin story."
2844,2,12-Dec,Japan,Always like a packed Tokyo commuter,"The place is always packed and you have to line up for hours just to go to your favorite attraction. Getting around inside the themepark can be challenging. Plus, you pay the extortionate admission of over 6000 yen for an adult ticket. But ironically, if you think about it, perhaps the price is doing its job of regulating entry. But you know that the locals will shell out a fortune and even brave the sea of humans just to have fun.Otherwise, you can say it's worth the experience."
2845,5,12-Dec,Malaysia,great experience,"be prepare for a huge crowd. be patient  and always queue up event for a photo session. The Japanese are so well discipline, they even queue up to take a photo. We did'n know that the queue was for taking photos, my daughter just rush and climb to the BuzzLightyear when we suddenly saw a few other visitors looking at us (angry? curious? foreigner?) opsss.. sorry! that was all i could say. The park are so clean and well maintained. if you do not have much time, do not waste it trying to catch a ride, you will lose the precious time seeing lots of other great attraction. The ride is so - so, meaning not that trill compared to Universal Studio."
2846,5,N/A,Australia,It's Disneyland,Expect a huge crowd as the Japanese love Disney! Not really any different than the theme parks in California or Florida but same high standards of cleanliness 
2847,4,12-Nov,Netherlands,For Disney lover it is an opportunity in Asia,"Disney Tokyo is build in the same format as Disney in Florida or California.I went there accompanying daughters that were curious in getting to know the park.The standards for Disney lovers are all kept... the attractions in the park as well as the fake Italian small villages or the Mexican pyramids...they are all there. The only difference is the amount of of Asian people, which is of course bigger than in US or Europe.Although not speaking Japanese, it is quite easy to go by train. the station drop you in the park and Japanese railways are easy to navigate even without speaking the language."
2848,5,12-Dec,Australia,Most beautiful themepark,"This really is the most beautifully decorated themepark.  Many souvenirs worthy of buying - and great food.  The rides were great - but keep note that with Disneyland, you can't expect too much 'thrill' or 'stimulation' as you would in more 'thrill' parks like Dreamworld or Universal Studios.  So Disneyland is a great place for everyone!Be sure to watch the afternoon and night parades."
2849,4,13-Oct,Saudi Arabia,"A lot of fun , a lot of queuing","Just like other Disneylands, tokyo's has a lot of fun for all family. Truly, other parks have way more thrilling roller coasters or other tides, but the themes and the atmosphere here make the difference. I went in the middle of t he week thinking it would be less crowded, but I was shocked by the huge number of students, some off them with school uniforms. We used our share of fast passes, but eventually all rides were available for queuing. I don't recommend the haunted mansion since all the voices are in Japanese, there is nothing scary. Also captain EO 3D movie is very old (1985). Actually, I watched it back then and it was great, so leave it till the end. Try to reach there by 8:00 AM to utilize your fast passes. The park is nearly one hour from Shinagawa station. Use keihin Tohoku or Yamanote line to Tokyo station, then take the JR Odeo line to Maihama. The park is just by the station. When I was there I regretted I didn't try the sealand park. I didn't try the food so I can't tell how good it was. By the way, better wear comfortable shoes as there will be queuing for 2 hours in some rides."
2850,5,13-Oct,Saudi Arabia,Great time with the children,"We had a great time at Tokyo Disney with our 2 and 4 year olds. I was really expecting horrible crowds with all of the previous reviews, but thankfully it wasn't bad. That is probably because we went in October, mid-week, and it wasn't great weather outside. Most rides were about 20 mins. The bigger rides (space mountain, etc) were about 45 mins. Nothing was over an hour. The fast pass worked very well. You grab one in the morning for the ride you want and come back later. The Japanese people were very nice and the place was spotless. The parades and rides are well done, although everything is in Japanese, so my children didn't understand much. But they recognized all of the characters. Disney Sea was great as well. We got a three day pass and easily could have spent two days in both parks. I only wish they didn't force you to choose which parks you will visit when you bought the tickets. You can do one day at one park and two days at another park. We stayed at the hilton (separate review) nearby and that was definitely the way to go! Stay at one of the hotels nearby if you have children with you."
2851,4,12-Dec,Canada,Disneyworld in miniature,Its a good day out but still a bit different from N American Disney venues. The rides are watered down and everything looks similar but smaller.
2852,4,13-Oct,Australia,Go for the shows,Terrible waiting times for nearly everything. Expensive day out but awesome show and my kids loved it....which is what it's all about.
2853,5,13-Oct,Malaysia,we loved Disney!,truly a kid's heaven this is. brought my 4year old son last week and though we had to queue a min of 40mins to 1hour for the rides (and to catch a picture with Mickey) it was all so worth it. the day and night Parade is nice and the finale fireworks was beautiful! will definitely be back for our 2nd visit soon
2854,3,13-Sep,Australia,Busy even in the rain,"Visited on a rainy Wednesday.  Even though it was not holiday time, it was still very crowded, with long waits for the popular rides.  Lots of friendly staff and well-maintained.  Easy access via train from the city.  Only visit if you have never been to a Disneyland before - otherwise it is pretty similar to the others."
2855,2,13-Oct,Indonesia,Don't even bother,This is by far the most expensive and let down during my trip to Japan. I spend 90 minutes round trip from Shibuya to Tokyo Disneyland only to find the theme park was so crowded. It wasn't even weekends. The waiting time for a not popular ride was 30 - 55 minutes. Obviously they oversold the tickets. We left after only 3 hours and 2 rides. Considering the tickets was JPY 6200 and not to mention train tickets fee what a waste of time and 'Happiness is definitely not here'.
2856,5,13-Sep,Malaysia,It's good to act like a kid again!,"I've been there with my husband during our honeymoon in Japan. We spent one whole day there and went back to hotel feeling very exhausted but worthwhile! I love every section in here especially the the small world. We even decided to enter that place twice! We went there during 30th celebration of Tokyo Disneyland on Saturday so as expected the place was filled with an ocean of Japanese people. Bad thing is you have to wait at least 10-30 mins to enter each place, even worst some places took hours long of waiting time. Nevertheless, we really enjoy being there and wish we could bring our children next time! :)"
2857,5,13-Oct,Singapore,It is total Disney Magic!,"We have been to HK Disney Land, loved it and still wanted to visit Tokyo DL. Good decision. Though it has certain similarities with HK, it has also lot of unique characteristics. As we had already done one DL, we did not rush through the day, but were selective with what we saw. Even then, one day was not enough. Thought the park was crowded, the crowds were well organized. There was no pushing or shoving at any point, though there was running for FP when the park opened. We went for FP for the rides we were extremely keen on, stood in queue for shorter ones in the first half and kept the rides where we couldn't get FP and were popular for evening. This way we managed to get on almost every ride we wanted, except Big Thunder Mountain, which developed technical difficulty after my daughter & husband had stood in queue for 90 minutes. But they got priority pass which they used for Buzz Lightyear which was another long wait. Loved the smoked turkey legs and the different flavoured churros. One more day here would have been ideal, unfortunately we had no time. Will love to return. Though we liked both Disney Sea and Land, we preferred Disney Land a bit more."
2858,5,13-Oct,United States,Exellent,"Having been to all of the American parks and to Hong Kong Disneyland, I have to see it was amazing to see the difference in Tokyo Disneyland. Yes, it was insanely crowded (that was my fault, I went on a holiday). I do feel like they let too many people in. I have never seen a Disney park that crowded before and I have been to Magic Kingdom in WDW on Christmas day and Epcot on New Year's Eve. "
2859,4,13-Oct,United States,Fun Filled Day for a Preschooler,"Although the lines to the park entrance at 8:30 a.m. (when the park opens) were super long, the lines to ""It's a Small World"" and the carousel weren't too long after we entered.  There were many special parades to celebrate the 30th anniversary as well as many Disney products and merchandise to choose from to celebrate.  The only downside was the cancellation of part of the New Orleans Minnie show, electrical parade, and fireworks show due to the weather (high winds).  Overall, we enjoyed a fun-filled family day at Tokyo Disneyland.  "
2860,5,13-May,United States,Disney in another land!,My boyfriend and I went to Tokyo Disneyland. It was an amazing experience and we had a blast with trying all the different foods that aren't available in the United states. They have characters popping up everywhere and although most things are in Japanese they have a few things still in English. Tokyo Disneyland wasn't as Princess-centric like in the USA and it was nice to see the excitement over original characters rather than the princesses. Definitely pay the extra money to get a popcorn bucket! It's worth the refills and you can use the bucket every time you visit!! The buckets are a collectible type thing and the refills are cheaper and the flavors are awesome and eccentric. Especially curry popcorn!!!Try to get their early and enjoy the whole day. Utilize the fastpasses for rides you really really want to do and try to manage your time. Also if you aren't overally interested in parades the lines for rides are shorter during the times they are going on. Also they have cheaper tickets if you only want to go from like 3:30pm on or 6pm on.
2861,5,12-Nov,Taiwan,revival,"I visited Tokyo Disneyland with my teenage son.  It is really a dreamland, a marvel, a wonderland for Alice, and the Neverland for Peter Pan.  I enjoyed being nobody, forgeting who I was or how old I was.  The creative entertainment parade, each recreational facility and the typical Disney characters popped up anywhere.  It seemed a travel back in time to my childhood.  Even with a sprained ankle, I walked around nearly half of the venue.  The topping on the cake was the Fireworks Display. breathtaking and moved me to tears.  Someday when I wish to be young at heart again, I will go back."
2862,5,12-Dec,South Africa,Best of Disney,"I've been to Disneyland Paris & Orlando, that one is by far THE best!Indiana Jones is a no miss & get the express tickets whenever possible."
2863,5,13-Oct,Canada,Amazing!,"Absolutely magical place, especially when the night comes and all the lights come on. We went for Halloween and the decorations are incredible, very well done, and park staff are lovely and very willing to help.Make sure you purchase express tickets though, because the lines can sometimes be up to 2 hours long for a single ride- very busy! Leave a whole day or ever two to explore the park, it's a huge place."
2864,4,13-Sep,Australia,Express tickets a must!!,"my son absolutely loved it, but be sure to purchase express tickets if you wish to go on rides, wait times are huge!!! we only managed to get on one ride - plus dont be fooled when lining up to visit mickey mouse we waited over an hour  & a half - the line up takes you through every room in the house, through the backyard, into the barn, then a lil movie theater and then finally there he is!!!! and we missed the grand parade while waiting. line ups even for a bag of popcorn is massive..."
2865,3,13-Oct,Australia,"Line up, Line Up!!","Let me start by saying I love Disneyland, but sadly I left Tokyo Disneyland feeling well and truly ripped off! We planned our travel to be out of the peak season, but the crowds were huge. We managed 1 ride when we first arrived with only a 20 minute wait time, but from there on the wait time was 2hours and 40 minutes for thunder mountain and the same for space mountain. To get your moneys worth out of the entry price is impossible. Having been to California Disneyland and Disney World in Florida where at this time of year you can get on most rides with a 15 -30 minute wait I didn't expect Tokyo to be so much more crowded. I think for us the final straw was lining up to use the rest room and around 5pm we headed back to out hotel very tired and let down after only 3 rides.On the positive side, like all Disney theme parks it is a magical place that is just fun to be in, and everyone is so polite and friendly."
2866,3,13-Sep,N/A,Beautiful but very child like,"Disneyland Tokyo is beautiful but there was only ine adult ride which had a 2 hour wait!Very crowded, long lines (saw one for 2 and a half hour) and probably more for the kids. If you don't have children under the age of 12 I wouldnt bother wasting my time or money. "
2867,3,13-Sep,United Kingdom,"Clean and Friendly, Crowded and Very Busy","Overall we enjoyed ourselves, but I would much rather visit Disneyland in California for many reasons, but the most is because of the crowds! If you go to Tokyo Disney on the weekend, it is way, way too busy. Even during the week it is busy. At least an hour to ride the major attractions. A few positives are that everybody their is friendly and helpful. In addition, as with other Disney parks, it is very clean and well taken care of. And surprisingly, it is not really that expensive for food and souvenirs, which I expected since it was Japan. The downside though again is the crowds. Even if you do get the Fast Pass, you will not get to return until several hours later or maybe the evening time.And finally, I was disappointed that there was not many characters around. To see Mickey Mouse, you had to wait in line for about 90 mins. Then the only other characters we saw all day were Captain Hook and Fairy Godmother walking around. In contrast, California's park you would see a minimum of 10 per day, including all the favorites like Mickey, Minnie, Pluto, Cinderella, Tinkerbell etc.Not sure I would go again. I would say this though, if you are going to go with little kids, the Fantasyland area seems less crowded than the others. Also, you can bring food and drinks into the park, which is very good way to save some money."
2868,5,13-Oct,Australia,"30 years old -- but still clean, fresh and fun !","This Disneyland is still my pick of Disney's stable. It's now 30 years old -- but has lost none of its appeal. It is immaculately clean, as modern as tomorrow, and lots of fun.Unfortunately, the crowds have increased dramatically over the 25 years since I last visited -- and the Waiting Times for the best rides can now be more than 100 minutes.The Blue Bayou Caf√© was a great place for lunch -- and for easy access to very clean, well-maintained toilets with no queues !My only criticism is that even at Disneyland which has lots of foreign tourists, and in the one ATM in the Disney Mitsui Bank branch -- no cash could be accessed via non-Japanese issued cards. However the bank staff were very helpful and suggested that ATM machines in any Japanese Post Office would allow cash withdrawals using foreign issued cards. In spite of not being able to get cash at Disneyland using my Australian-issued credit card -- the card was happily accepted for purchases in all outlets."
2869,2,13-Sep,Germany,Avoid under any circumstances,"We have now been to Disneylands in Paris, Los Angeles, Hong Kong and now Tokyo as well as Epcot Center Miami. We have visited at least a dozen of other theme parks around the globe. This must have been the most crowded one BY FAR. We came on a Monday on the last day of September, I'm not familiar with school holidays in Japan, but I imagine, it was a school day. We thought we were smart having bought the tickets in advance and having avoided the first queue of at least an hour, I think if we hadn't, we might have opted for DisneySea next door. The first ride we came across was the Monsters Inc. one with a waiting time of 200 (!) minutes. As a Star Wars fan, I wanted to do the Star Tours ride, but that had a waiting time of 120 minutes, so we got Fast Pass tickets for that ride which was due 2 hours later at 12:30. We passed the time until then with mediocre rides, and wanted to get new Fast Pass tickets for the Monsters Inc ride, but behold: FP ticketing for that ride (and for the Buzz Lightyear one, and Space Mountain) had already ended! Mind you, the park was opened for another 9 3/4 hours! By the time we made it to the other side of the park, there were no FP tickets available for any rides. All the attractive rides had a line of at least 90 minutes, and that did not change until the park was closed. Even the boring ones, like the Dumbo or the Merry-go-round, you know those, which you can find at your local fair for 2.50 EUR, had people queuing up for an hour. They had a nice parade going on, at least from what we could make out, as we had been ushered away every time we had a good view. We haven't managed to find out the reason as English speaking personell was hard to come by. Considering that admission for adults is 6200 Yen (about 46.50 EUR) and discounts are hardly available, spending 10 hours waiting in line for 3 good rides and maybe 4 mediocre ones is a costly way to spend your time.If you are in Tokyo and you have to visit one of the Disney theme parks, I suggest you try DisneySea. However I strongly recommend going to Disneyland on another continent (most stuff is in Japanese anyway). PS: I made it onto the Monsters Inc. ride after waiting 95 minutes in line at 10:05 pm in the evening"
2870,3,13-Sep,China,Like Disneyland Hong Kong but wait times much longer,"We have two young sons and spent the morning at Disney Seas.  Since it closed early we had the option to head to Disneyland for an extra 2,000 each so we took advantage of it.  We left Disney Seas with the very short wait times and spent the evening at Disneyland waiting over one hour for the Dumbo ride.  Other rides where worse with over 130 minute wait times and no fast pass available. The set up is pretty much like Disneyland Hong Kong.  The food is just OK with nothing to eat from the street vendors but different flavored popcorns or the same freezy bars at each place.  Ad of course, the are more stores and restaurants than entertainment options.  After experiencing one Disneyland, I wasn't impressed.  My 5 year old did like Toontown, there is only one ride in there and it is a coaster which he liked.  Funny how that coaster is in with little kid stuff and the only people on it were adults.  My son loved going through Donald's boat even though there wasn't a whole lot of interactive things.  If you don't have time for both, I would do Disney Seas as a nice change from the typical Disneyland experience. Disney Seas does seem to be geared towards the older kids but my 5 and 8 year old loved it (but they ready boys, not into princesses)."
2871,5,13-May,India,Disney Land - Need I say more!,"Simply Superb excellent. I just got transited to my childhood. The best part was the Disney Hotel - I havent seen such grandeur ever (except in the fairytales) and yes, it was like a fairy land. The attractions and parade was beautifully executed and the most exciting thing. Very neat and clean and organised. Amicable staff."
2872,4,13-Sep,Australia,Love Disney!!,"Disneyland is always a magical place to be for both young and old. Having done California and Hong Kong already, I quite enjoyed the Tokyo Disneyland. It's different in its own right but still has that magical feeling inside. It's more spacious than California and yes there were crowds everywhere but that's expected in any theme park!! It's worth visiting!!!"
2873,5,13-Sep,N/A,Great but busy,"We went to Disneyland on a fairly cool rainy day, thinking this might lessen the crowds. We could not have been more wrong. Thousands came the place was packed. However it was great. Plenty of space. The lines for rides were updated with the wait times however the longest we waited was 45 minutes which I thought was pretty good. The staff were helpful. The best thing about Tokyo Disney are the people going everyone dresses up in costume it's amazing we couldn't tell who were hired characters and who were customers in costume. A fantastic day. "
2874,5,13-Apr,United Kingdom,Now have the complete set.,"On my ""bucket list"" was Visit ALL Disneylands. The last one was in Tokyo and last years trip round the world allowed us to stop of in Tokyo for a few days.AS usual Disney did not disappoint. Pirates and It's a small world being my favourites.We chose our day to go and not being able to read Japanese , did not realise a Typhoon was about to hit Tokyo.It , luckily did not arrive until we had almost finished.After enjoying Disney we started for our hotel, only for the Typhoon to  hit and shut down all the transport system. Our 30 min journey turned into 5 hrs and most of that was in an underground station, with the storm doors down. An experience that will remain with us for the rest of our lives."
2875,4,13-Sep,United States,nice but crowded,"for sure it is a nice place, but it was completely crowded when we visited. If haven't bought the tickets in advance we would not get in because they were sold out. The attractions and parade were great for our young kids, the food not so much. As anything in Japan, it was very clean and organized; and the staff is always willing to help."
2876,2,13-Sep,Malaysia,"Lots of waiting, unexceptional rides","I went to Universal Studios in Osaka the last trip to Japan, had a great time and decided to do Disney this time instead. It was a bad choice. The rides were unexceptional. And lots of waiting time (Fastpass is limited, and on one occasion, even the Fastpass queue was exceptionally long). This is my second trip to DIsneyland (first time at Disney HK)."
2877,5,13-Sep,United States,Familiar and fun,"We had a great time at Tokyo Disneyland, although it's much more crowded than California Disneyland mid-week in mid-September. (Think mid-July in California, that's an average day at Tokyo Disneyland). My husband prefers Tokyo Disneyland to California Disneyland; I prefer California. I do like the layout of Tokyo Disneyland better--it feels more open and easier to get around in. Perhaps because there's no Matterhorn and no Indiana Jones so there is literally more space. Also Japanese people are more orderly and polite than anyone else in the world, so that could have something to do with it. The rides are pretty much the same as Disneyland in California, but Space Mountain felt a little slower and had no music. :( It was still fun, but music really makes a big difference. Splash Mountain was also a little different...You sit in pairs in the log rather than a single line (so there's less leg room) and you don't get nearly as wet...You will get splashed in your face if you're in the front, but that's the wettest you'll get. Single rider line is more enjoyable in California because you're not sitting next to anyone...I recommend fast pass or early standby on this instead of single rider so you can sit with your party. The standby line is 2-3 hours on a typical day mid-week in mid-September (not a holiday) after 12 pm...If you go on this ride first thing in the morning, standby is 40-60 min. All of the other rides here are pretty much the same as California Disneyland. As with DisneySea, overall, the food was NOT impressive. Bring food from outside if you can. The Queen of Hearts Restaurant was not bad though. The detail of the restaurant is awesome and the food was pretty good--similar prices to a buffeteria at Disneyland in California, maybe a little pricier considering the smaller portion sizes though.Tips: Get there early--no later than an hour after opening so you can get as many fastpasses as possible. The first day, we got in around 15 min after opening and the second day we got in around 45 min after opening...both days we got two fastpasses. Decide the three rides you want to do the most and have one member of the party run for fastpasses while the rest of your party goes to the other ride and gets in line. As soon as your first fastpass window opens up, go get fastpasses for the third ride you want to go on, and so on. Wouldn't recommend an after 6 pm ticket here unless you're just coming for the parade or a show or something. "
2878,4,13-Sep,Japan,Dream Land Halloween Version in Tokyo,"There is a very famous amusement park in Japan.This season is Halloween!!!so, all decoration is a Halloween version.There is special Halloween version in Parade!!!Every year, Many people visit there.Let's go to there.‚òÜ"
2879,5,13-Sep,Libya,Diesneyland Tokyo,If you are visiting Japan don't miss to visit a great things in Japan and diesneyland is one of the best places to visit and you of course it is full of attractions and for children it is endless fun. You can get their with train or buses from every where in Japan.
2880,4,12-Oct,Sri Lanka,Worth more than money you spend!!,"It was awesome each time I visit,there is something new.For this amount of money JPY6200, you get a whole a lot of attractions and parades etc. Guidance maps are everywhere, and the customer care is at max..there are bunch of nice restaurants and the Food is great as well.. Anybody can enjoy here regardless of age..truly a paradise.."
2881,4,13-Feb,N/A,"people, people, and more people + awesome attractions","The moment we bought the tickets from the booth our excitement jumped to overdrive. II'm not a fan of Winnie the Pooh but wait 'til you get inside, it's was my most favorite. The food is overpriced but everything else is super great!"
2882,5,12-Oct,Australia,MUST VISIT,"If you ever go to Tokyo, this is one attraction you must visit.  It's huge and you would need a full day to see the attractions there.  It's really fantastic, thoroughly enjoyed it and we are not young but seniors!"
2883,4,13-Aug,Spain,Blame the extra hot weather not Disney,We spent 2 day to cover the whole disney with heavy wait time.spend 2.5 hours for monster inc. New and most popular rides.Then we saw the parade.nothing special compare to hongkong disney.think because its heavy equipt with robotic instead with actual dancer/performance.Many unique and fun rides.But for muslim food that need halal its very difficult in japan also.Only seafood pizza popcorn some big turkey leg so for kids is difficult to get something to eat.They sell rice bento but only in tomorrowland.Also very difficult to get bottled water.only sold in kids land for toddler.They sell water like pocary sweat but ordinary water only in particular area.Better to go in spring maybe.August very hot that i saw few kids collapse of deihydration.
2884,3,13-Mar,United Kingdom,So crowded!,"We went on a Friday and my biggest memory of the day was queuing! I love all things Disney and the attractions themselves were great but it just took so long to wait for each thing. My favourite thing was the parades. Absolutely magical. Unfortunately the evening fireworks were cancelled (I think it was because of the weather but I don't speak Japanese to know exactly).In terms of getting there, you can get a bus. Beware that it can be hard to find someone who speaks English. Our bus took us to Disney Seaworld instead so we had to pay extra for a monorail to take us to Disneyland. However getting the bus was so relaxing when compared with trains and it was nice to have a bus ride home in the evening knowing we'd be dropped off in the right spot. Almost everyone was asleep on the bus back!If I were to go again, I'd possibly go for a two day pass so that I could plan my time better. Planning at Disney is the key!"
2885,4,12-Oct,Australia,Great mini-version of the real thing!,"From the moment we arrived in Tokyo, we were excited to go to Disneyland. While some of the attractions were closed for maintenance, we had an absolute ball. A definite must visit for all ages in Tokyo!"
2886,4,13-Aug,United Kingdom,"Great day out, just be prepared to queue","My wife and I went for a day out to Disneyland Tokyo and can honestly say we both loved it. This is particularly high praise given I'm not really into A) Disney or B) theme parks. Disneyland to theme to the max, even your chicken nuggets in the fast food cafes are shaped like Mickey Mouse!As far as the rides go, please just get there early - especially on a weekend. Make sure you use the fast pass system, which effectively means you don't have to queue, but you can only 'fast pass' one ride at a time. As for the rest of the rides, get comfortable with queueing, the average waiting time at a weekend being around 2 hours or more for the more popular rides. On the whole, Disneyland Tokyo is great, if you are in two minds whether you should give it a go, just do it, its tiring but you really won't be disappointed, especially if you have kids (or a wife who still thinks she is 12!). Enjoy - we certainly did."
2887,5,12-Oct,Australia,I loved it,"Disneyland in Japan is amazing, parents walk around wearing costumes getting WAY into the disney spirit. The monorail is a great way to get around. Honestly i didn't think much of the food, but there are plenty of choices. The plate sizes in japan are always small (apart from ramen) but we had a great time in the park"
2888,5,13-Aug,New Zealand,Thought we may be a bit old,"After having reservations about going, we had an excellent day, It was Summer Vacation for schools so expected way bigger lines that we got, shows were awesome and we went on two of the major rides using the 'Fastpass' method. The only draw back was there was no space in the restaurants to sit, we ended up sitting on the floor like a lot of other people. If it gets to hot there was shows in air conditioned areas. "
2889,4,13-Jul,United States,Disneyland was way better,"The park was interesting only because we were in Japan. Pros were the lines, even though longer than the states, went faster, clean, and like I've said before had different things to shop for than the ones in the US. Cons were most animated rides were in Japanese so you couldn't really understand what they were saying. food sold is all ala carte so if you buy a burger, fries and soda it could cost you close to $15. If you have a big family I suggest a snack during the day and the buffet for dinner. Also don't expect to get a lot of treats that the US offers. Mostly they had tons of different types of popcorn, waffles, Popsicles, and crepes. Except for the food souvenir store that had gift boxes of cookies. There's no refillable cups. So the day we went just happened to have a heat wave so I spent majority of our money buying bottles of water ($2) all day. Then only frontier town sold plain water so we had to walk back there every time we wanted water. All other vendors sold oolong tea and orange flavored water. One thing I did learn was that those refillable popcorn cases that you get at Disneyland works at all parks. So if you have one from the states you can use it here. The rides seem shorter too. All in all it was interesting. Glad I went just to have that experience. Everyone was very nice and helpful especially when you don't know the language. I think though it was a one time thing for me. "
2890,5,13-Jun,Germany,A childhood dream come true,Worth a Visit-awesome childhood fantasies-bring lots a time for waiting-come early.Disney in his perfection. The starlight show when its getting dark is finishing a most beautiful day.
2891,2,12-Oct,Australia,don't bother - never seen so many people in my life!,"you can buy cheap tickets from ticket shops in shinjuku - the small shops that have glass counters with all kinds of tickets - we paid half price for two VIP entry tickets.we went middle of the week, when we figured no one would be there (or much less)arrived around 11am, only to find about a zillion people in the park. all the early entry tickets were shut and for one ride the line up was about 3 and a half hours.did 3 rides, then ditched the place. Not worth going at all with the ridiculous crowds."
2892,5,13-Aug,Canada,Great place to spend time with kids,"This was my first time to Tokyo Disneyland and it was a lot of fun to be with a bunch of kids.  Our group was part of a youth exchange program between Canada and Japan and they enjoyed themselves so much and had a great day together.  We (2 chaperones) had 4 teenagers from North Vancouver, (Canada) and 4 from Chiba, (Japan) so our group of 10 had a wonderful day going on all the rides. The heat was the only thing that concerned me.......it was very hot and very humid.  We made sure everyone drank lots of water.Make sure that you get the ""fast pass"" as it will save you a lot of time."
2893,5,13-Feb,Japan,Amazing on all levels,"Fun, exciting, friendly and great. Me and my family spent 3 days in Tokyo Disneyland and Disney-Sea and the only negative part was the pain under the feet due to all walking, but that was sort of self inflicted.We will definitely go back again soon!"
2894,4,13-Sep,United States,Original Disneyland transplanted to Tokyo.,This is virtually an exact replica of Disneyland in California and when I say exact I mean exact even the rocket ship in tomorrowland says USA on the side. 95% of the rides are what you will find in America but with an extra hour added to the wait time. Pricing was surprising to say the least the cost to enter the park is about half of Disneyland in California and food costs inside the park have virtually no markup so that was a pleasant surprise. If you live in Japan or have an extended stay the park is definitely worth going to prefferably off season and mid week to help with the crowd but if you have a short visit it isn't worth going unless Disneyland is the reason for your trip to Tokyo. 
2895,5,12-Oct,Sweden,"very nice good park, good day","Was a much better park than the old one in Florida. Good booking system so no waiting time in lines needed. The Volcano Rollercoaster is fun (best), but total park is great."
2896,5,13-Apr,Australia,Mickey in Tokyo,Great place but huge cues!!! We only had a day and spent most of it in cues!! The resort is in in top condition and everything is perfect . Very glad we had pre purchased our tickets.
2897,4,13-Aug,N/A,Unforgettable,"It's a totally different world in Tokyo Disneyland! The effects there, the games, the characters, all of which offer a mini resort from everyday life. However, there were rides in which I had to wait a lot so I didn't get to try all rides (which is a bit disappointing) and shopping there is a bit expensive .. P.s the haunted house has great effects !! You see ghosts!"
2898,4,13-Mar,Croatia,Great for kids,"Its really great, specially Pirates of Caribbean, but for best things you can wait in the line more than couple of hours."
2899,5,12-Oct,Indonesia,Long day vacation,"A must place to go but need to be there as early as possible, especially if you bring some children. I could only spent time at the Western country and had no chance to explore other sites, due to the long queue for hours! Bring some food for home could help a lot while waiting for the parade during daytime, and at night while watching the magnificent fireworks. I  would love to go back at the Pirates of the Caribbean, my fave spot."
2900,3,13-Aug,United States,Very crowded attraction,"There were huge lines for everything there. The first show at 11 am a Splash show has a three hour wait when you arrive at 8 am. If you arrive much later, you will be in the stranding room area. Many people show up for the first show as the other shows require tickets, and  use a lottery system. The Pirates of the Caribbean is a nice boat ride, the Stitch show is a waste of time. Try the terimisu ice cream sandwich for 300 Yen made by Meiji as it is delicious."
2901,4,13-Aug,United States,Disney Sea is Worth a Visit,"Although we visited Disney Sea on the hottest and most humid day of the year, my 8 year old daughter and I enjoyed a shortened visit to this attraction.  Make sure you get an English language map which is available on request because we struggled to make any sense of the Japanese version!  As with any Disney park, the lines were long and the FastPass was mostly useless given entry tickets 10 hours later (at 11am we got a fastpass ticket for 10pm for the Indiana Jones ride).  But Disney Sea had some unique attractions, particularly Triton's Kingdom which is all indoors and provides an enclosed area for kids to run around and explore.  The Lagoon Show was entertaining.  The park was easy to get to by subway, had lots of restrooms and food places, but be prepared for big crowds!"
2902,2,13-Aug,Switzerland,Large waiting time,"We arrived with my family at 7:15 and there were already thousands of people waiting for the opening 8am.  At the opening, everyone ran to the queue. On the most popular attractions there were up to 240 minues waiting !  Before the parade, visitors were already installed 45 minutes before the beginning."
2903,5,13-Jan,N/A,i Just love the turkey leg!,apart from the rides as I always and will always love at Disneyland. I tried this turkey leg that was 200 yen per piece... loved it but can't eat the 2 legs i ordered i was just too full! hahhaha
2904,4,13-Aug,United States,Horribly long lines,"We visited Tokyo Disneyland on August 5th in the afternoon after a half day visit to Disney Sea. It was a very hot and humid Monday! Despite our significant experience with Disney parks (we‚Äôve been multiple times to all of them except Hong Kong‚Ä¶which will be taken care of next week! ) we surrendered at 14 pm after enjoying only a few rides. By 1 pm all the Fast Pass were distributed and most headliners were showing 100 minutes + wait time with Splash Mountains peaking at 150 minutes! The only relief for this one was the single rider line, a concept misunderstood by the locals, because despite there was this 150 minutes waiting for the normal line it was like you had the park only for you using the single rider line (really no wait at all!). It sad that only this attraction featured the single rider line!!"
2905,3,13-Jul,New Zealand,Tons crowd with horrible waiting time!,"Been there 2 times in the winter but never visited in the summer holidays. Absolutely horrible experience! The ""people sea""  has flooded to the train station before 8am open time! Prople everywhere, all the "" fastpass"" gone immediately, waiting time for some most popular rides at least 90- 180 mins! Even 30 mons for buying a popcorn! Please try to avoid these hot seasons in you plan."
2906,5,13-Jul,Indonesia,Great for All Ages,"We went there on Monday and arrived there half an hour before the park opened, but it was obviously not a good plan since it was already very crowded.  It was our daughter's birhtday and we were planning to have breakfast with the character inside the park, but we were disappointed since the restaurant had been closed for the breakfast due fully occupied.However we still had lots of fun here.  The attractions, the rides, the shows were all amazing, but I would recommend to learn about the park before you go.  So once you enter the park, you know already which rides you want to play first and go & get fast pass ticket immediately.  Without the fast pass we have to queue for about 1.5 to 2 hours.  It also happened when we wanted to have lunch at Queen of Heart Banquet, there was also a long queue.Overall we had a very good time and we recommend it for everyone who visit Tokyo."
2907,5,13-Jul,United States,Covered Main Street,"This Disney park has a covered main street, which gives it a different look when you first come into the park. And it's laid out very different but still has the Disney feel. Go early, leave in the afternoon when it's to hot and then go back in the evening. "
2908,3,12-Dec,N/A,good but CROWDED!!!,"The attractions were nicely created. They were more child-friendly than Universal Studios (if u know what i mean). This is a great place for kids to play and have fun! It's obviously a must visit in Tokyo. I recommend the pass thingy (the one where u just show the card and can go straight in. there is one like that right?) The place is too crowded. You must have to wait like 1 or more hours to just go in one attraction! I can rate it 4 stars but because of the crowd, it's down to 3 stars :/"
2909,4,13-Mar,United States,A little different than the US Disney locations...very crowded,"Since we live in Tokyo, we have been many times. Always super packed, of course you want to avoid the weekends and summer, especially Oban, the 2nd wk of August. You must get the fast passes early and you must show up when the park opens. The last hour before it closes, the lines decrease some. We have taken the train each time, but the kids get really tired if you stay until the end and the walk in the subway is super long, so it is best to drive if you can. Better yet, I would stay at the hotel. We usually eat the Blue Bayou restaurant but it books up really early, so if you want to eat there, eat during non- peak times. The Blue Bayou is fairly reasonable and the kids dish is served on a mickey plate. I highly recommend the seafood casserole dish. It is so crowded that it is a sea of people, almost shoulder to shoulder at times. The have a lot of unique popcorn flavors and food choices."
2910,2,13-Jul,Singapore,Like every other disney land but with huge crowds,"I was told to avoid the weekends because of the crowds, week day crowds was huge. I even woke up early before opening time, but turned out half of Tokyo had the same plan. Some of the queues to ride were 2 hours long! There was even a 40 min queue for the fats pass machines. After 5 days at Disney we spent a total of 3 hours at the park, we got so fed up with the system ended up taking the train into Tokyo and explored the city instead. Disney sea is a bit more interesting as you have things at the park you don't see at other disney resorts. But again same problem with crowds. If you are the sort that follow strict time tables etc then the fast pass system is for you, if you are the sort that just likes to do things on the spur of the moment then forget disney, there are so many more interesting things to do in Japan. "
2911,5,12-Dec,Australia,Love disneyland!,Best experience for all ages! I personally love Walt Disney myself so i found it enjoyable! Love all the rides and the helpful staff at Disneyland. No better way to first experience my first Disneyland! Going to to Disneyland in Paris and hopefully it will be the same!
2912,4,13-Jul,India,What's not to like! It's DISNEYland :),"An enjoyable day, especially if you love anything Disney-related (and if you have kids in the right age!). My husband and I are both Disney fans, and it is a great day trip from Tokyo. All the attractions are good, and while I have motion sickness and can never got on a rotating / revolving ride or attractions, I really enjoyed myself. In case fellow sufferers are wondering, I didn't get sick even on the roller-coaster (though it did give me a headache). Don't miss the afternoon parade - it is much livelier and upbeat than the night one (the latter is more visually appealing but very mellow).In any case, it is a legendary attraction and has many other attractions to keep everyone happy. Most of the shows were in Japanese, which was a bummer - we don't know the language - but still, it's worth it. The restaurants - too many to count! - were great, spread out in every ""zone"" and consistently served good food. The staff throughout the resort are very helpful and courteous, and the facilities are top notch. I don't know what we would have done without the Fast pass option... we got a couple and it made just a difference (5 minutes wait instead of up to an hour)...It really is better to go there early in the morning... we went around noon, and in the heat - it was bloody hot in July, - it was quite tired standing in a queue everytime.... The lines were indeed insane - we waited 45 minutes for Pooh's Hunny hunt - and we went on a weekday. It was packed throughout the day and I have no idea how people visit this place on the weekends!"
2913,5,13-Jul,Australia,Excellent day,"We went to Disneyland on a Tuesday just before the Japanese school holidays and although the place was definitely full of people, we didn‚Äôt really notice it.  I was surprised that we never had to queue for food or the bathrooms.  We took full advantage of the fast pass system and managed to go on Splash Mountain, Space Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain twice.  We went on every other ride that was operating once (except for the Buzz Lightyear and Monsters Inc rides).  The only ride not operating was Pinnochio.  The longest ride queue we had was for Space Mountain (we didn‚Äôt use a fast pass the first time) and it only took 50 minutes.We were very impressed with the ride lines.  Although some lines were long, we were constantly moving or had something to look at.  We did get annoyed at the number of teenagers cutting in line to join their friends though.I highly recommend Pooh‚Äôs Hunny Hunt.  Even as a young couple in our early 20s with no children, we loved it.We also found food to be quite reasonably priced as we were expecting to pay ridiculous theme park prices.  Ice creams were 300 to 400 yen each.  800 to 1000 yen for a burger, chips and drink."
2914,3,13-Jul,China,Long wait even on a weekday,The queues at tokyo disneyland are very long even during weekdays. Went on a Wednesday just before the Japan school holidays but had to queue a long time for many attractions. The Fast Pass was used only once as trying to use it at 12pm meant coming back at 20:40 for the attraction. The queuing was quite orderly.
2915,3,13-Jul,Australia,Poor food,"Went on a Wednesday to Disney Sea, no crowds just a few people around, went on the boat ride and the train that was pretty much it, The food, were do I start (I can't find any thing good to say) take your own it was trouble. Like most places like this everything was over priced, don't need to do it again, but I'm 48 maybe a bit old to enjoy, what's with not having any seating around the place? That's it in a nut shell"
2916,1,13-Jul,China,Terrible staff attitude,"Surprisingly the lines weren't too long and it took less than 30 minutes to get on Star Tours, so no complaints there (we went on a Thursday). However, think twice before you sit on a bench 2 hours ahead of the parade and happen to be a foreigner. I was sitting on a bench with my brother and father, with 1 plastic bag full of souvenirs. As most of the stuff was glass, my father decided to put it on the bench before he headed off to the washroom. Turns out to be a big no no. One of the staff members saw that I was holding onto a green leaflet (the English version of the parade schedule) and asked if I was waiting for the parade. I said yes, then she started firing away in JAPANESE. Ok, if I understood Japanese, why would I need a translated leaflet? Turned out she wanted me to remove the bag from the bench, thinking I was occupying the entire bench for myself. Not wanting to waste more time trying to understand her Japanese, I did as she requested. Then my brother looked over and pointed over to another lady on a bench across from us, where she had the ENTIRE bench full of shopping bags with no one else sitting with her. So why was I asked to remove one single bag from the bench, when it was obvious that lady was hogging the entire bench for her friends? My father returned, heard what happened, then purposely put the bag on the bench again when my brother headed off to the washroom. The same staff member came over and this time, my father was determined to cause a commotion and asked her why she didn't pick on the lady across from us. She ignored our requests to get someone who could actually understand English and kept speaking in Japanese with an extremely rude tone. She then kept shoving a translated version of the ""park rules"" in our faces. We finally got the attention of her supervisor and apparently she didn't even understand the rules herself. She automatically assumed we were hogging the entire bench, not allowing anyone else to sit down, just because of the plastic bag. The bench was for four people and we had three. And the rules clearly state we are allowed to occupy the bench as long as our entire party returned in time for the parade. We even invited someone who couldn't find a seat to sit with us in the end. What about the lady on the bench across from us? Three people in total and a bunch of bags on the bench. Another lady on the bench next to ours actually occupied an entire bench and the space in front of her with two beach mats. If that isn't double standards, I don't know what is. A bit racist too. If this is how tourists are treated at Tokyo Disneyland, it's hardly the ""happiness"" they keep advertising at all. Her supervisor apologized, told us we were right about the rules and got her out of the area for the entire parade (she never apologized herself). I'm still looking for an email address to send my complaints to and won't be returning."
2917,4,13-Jul,Thailand,Good for kids under 7,Disney land is a place for kids under seven because the rides are ok for us 10 year olds the roller coasters are not that scary and the best one is thunder mountain. But should go there because it might be fun for you.
2918,5,13-Jul,Japan,Always great,"Of course it's fun, we got there on the weekdays so lines weren't too bad. Get up early to get your fastpass."
2919,4,13-Jul,Australia,Lines not too long,Went on a Thursday and even though a lot of people we didn't have to wait too long for the rides.  Very similar to Hong Kong Disney.  Do the coasters early and the Star Tours.  I would avoid when the busy periods are on.  You'd wait for ages.
2920,4,13-Jul,Australia,Pleasantly surprised,"After reading so many bad reviews about the amount of people and the wait times for rides, we were not feeling very positive about our day here. Arriving on the train looking out towards the park, wow, people everywhere the lines to get in were massive (we arrived at 9am). If we did not have pre purchased tickets I think we would have turned around. However, the lines moved very fast and once inside the park is huge. We headed to our number 1 ride and joined the queue as well as getting fast tickets for a later time. We managed to get 5 fast ride tickets throughout the day and they were totally worth getting. We found the queues to be reasonable with most wait times around the 40 minute mark. We didn't watch much of the parade, instead used this time to get onto rides that basically become deserted. In most cases there wasn't even a line. Food is very average inside and finding water is near impossible. The turkey leg was delicious but most other stuff was crap. We had a fantastic day, yes there were people everywhere and we had to queue for everything but we aren't planing another trip to Tokyo so it was a definite must do for us."
2921,3,13-Jul,United Kingdom,If only it was less busy,"Travelled half way round the world to visit this park.  As other people have said it was quiet walking up to get tickets and to get in, but then inside the volume of people is unbelievable.  We ended up walking right round the park just looking for a ride that didn't have a line over one hour and that didn't mean waiting in direct sunlight.  Nothing.  We managed to get a fast pass for Splash mountain to return at 4pm.  This was at 9:30am, and all the other fast pass tickets were finished.  We eventually did Pirates of Caribean (30mins wait with a bit of it outside) and then a 80 min wait for Big Thunder Mountain (it had just reopened after a break down).  Went back to hotel for a swim and went back late afternoon for Slash Mountain.  There was a thunderstorm which meant everyone went undercover, so we were able to get on a couple more rides once the rain stopped.Very disappointed to have come all that way and hardly got on any rides.Went back 2 days later and was there at opening time.  Lines are massive, but it means you can get a fast pass for the popular rides.It was a bit quieter as it was a week day.  40min waits were now average, although some were still 80mins.I have now been to all the Disney parks around the world.  This was by far the busiest and had the longest lines.  The lines for food were huge and they sit down waiting for shows in incredible heat, hours before they start.Tips:  be there for opening to get a fast pass ticket and then get on another good ride.Stay at a hotel nearby so that you can go back to hotel during the day and go back to park at night when it's a bit quieter. (We stayed at Hilton Tokyo Bay)Avoid weekends and public holidays.Get a 3 day pass.  You won't get round all the rides in a day.  It's just too busy.You can pay a LOT extra for a guide who can get you in fast pass lane of all the rides, but it seems to only be available for Japanese speaking guests. This is not very well advertised and must be booked in advance.Be prepared for long lines and smile - it's Disney after all!Disney Sea next door has better rides."
2922,2,13-Jul,Mauritius,An amusement park for line waiting,"We arrived at the park fairly early at 10am. Seemed quite slow when we walked up to the gates and excitedly thought we would be able to get quite a few rides and lunch in...Unfortunately it was quite the opposite. We were at the park for 9 hours and we just managed to squeeze in 4 rides and lunch. Minimum wait on a ride was 100 mins. Fast Passes were all sold out by the time we arrived. The wait for lunch was even 90 minutes. We tried to get some snacks instead from the carts, those were all 30 mins. Want a bottle of water from a vending machine. 15 minute wait and a massive line. We tried to buy a few things from the gift shop and a cast member told us it was a 30 minute line to pay for your item at the registers. An overwhelming majority of the Japanese people there didnt seem to mind. Everyone was all smiles in all of the lines. But when you spend 90% of your day just waiting around - it sort of sucks the fun out if everything. We consider ourselves to be quite easygoing people, but this day was stressful. Side note for vegetarians : there is only one place at the park that has one dish that is vegetarian. The pasta w vegetables at East Side Cafe. Everything else in the park has meat. Apparently you are allowed to bring in your own food if you are veg."
2923,4,12-Oct,Israel,"Tons of fun, long long queues!","The place is amazing, the attractions are SUPER FUN - like buzz light-year, the racing track and etc, but the queues are just too much! We waited an average of 1-1.5 hours per attraction!Good thing we came in the morning, otherwise we wouldn't make it to see more then a couple of attractions. The parade in the evening is the main thing you should look for, it is spectacular. The prices of food are very high - buy at a local shop before going there, will save you a lot of yen! Overall, a great place, just arrive early and you will make most of the good attractions."
2924,5,13-Jul,Indonesia,Amazing Souvenir,"The collection of souvenirs in every shop are not equal. Depend of the game near the shop. It is easy to find key chain (compare to Disney Sea) but still hard to find magnet for refrigerator.The game itself is amazing. But I am still scare to be in the boat of Splash Mountain. But it is very challenging.In July there are two parades. The first one is tanabata (only 3 minutes) and the second is the regular one in the afternoon. Before the parade, be wise to find seat location so you can see them clearly. Or sit near any restaurant if you want to eat after that."
2925,4,13-Jul,Australia,Where dreams really do come true..,"I had extremely high expectations for Tokyo Disneyland and they were nearly all met - most exceeded.We visited on a Wednesday, and whilst it was crowded, we still managed to get on a couple of rides. I recommend utilising the fast pass option as soon as you arrive at the park, otherwise you may miss out on some of the more popular attractions.All the attractions are done very well, so too is the night parade - so definitely stay for this if you can! Whilst there are several gift shops (including one outside the park) I was disappointed with the selection. I also think the park could benefit from showcasing some Disney history - which the park currently lacks. Was also disappointed by the lack of character meet and greets, and the fact they did not make their way around the park for photos. I assumed, like most theme parks, character would be greeting guests throughout the day. Lots of staff, who are all extremely friendly and smile with every word. They try very hard with English and can speak enough of it to suffice. Overall, very satisfying day! Definitely recommend."
2926,1,13-Jun,Australia,"Im really sorry, but this was really bad.","I have been lucky enough to go to Disneyland in Paris, Disneyworld in Florida and now Disneyland in Tokyo. But it was awful :(   And its all because of the crowds. Yes, we went on a Sunday, and the weather was good. But it wasn't school holidays or any kind of holiday season for tourists..  And it was still packed. The thing is when you first walk in, it doesn't seem that bad. Its such a massive place, everything seems not too busy. But it was so bad. Firstly Space Mountain was closed.  And with the other more 'adult' rides, the minimum wait we saw was 150 minutes....  That is 2 and a half hours to wait for a 4 minute ride!!!  The crazy thing is, the Japanese are all happy to wait! It was unbelievable. The most surprising thing I saw was at around 12pm, I noticed all of these people sitting in the middle of the street, all in a line. Not a huge amount, but enough to make me look and think ""what are they doing?"". And then I realised. They were getting themselves in position for the 3.00 parade!!   It was still 3 hours away !!!   I honestly was stunned. It really wasn't worth staying and we actually left after 2 hours of just wandering around. Going to Disneyland Tokyo wasn't a big thing on our agenda, but we thought it would be something fun to do. But it was very disappointing. Getting there is super easy though. As a tourist from outside of Japan, you can use the JR pass as there is a JR line that goes all the way there."
2927,4,13-Jul,United Kingdom,Better than US Disney,"Having been to the Florida Disney a few years ago with my kids I was highly reluctant to go again, in fact i vowed never to go near such a place again - but succumbed under duress.  Actually it wasn't that bad, much better than the US version, cleaner and newer. We went on a Thursday and the queues were fine, we had a bit of a wait to get on the Star Tours (best ride there), but otherwise didn't have to wait too long.  We didn't even bother with fast passes. So all in all I took it for the team survived. Hopefully that means I will never have to go again..."
2928,5,13-Jul,N/A,Much Better Than Expect,"After reading reviews, I was worried, but we had a fantastic day. We went on a Tuesday that was hot, so maybe there were less people (certainly the barriers in place for the queues suggested as such). First, the place is incredibly clean. Secondly, the food was much better than people suggested. Thirdly, if you use the fastpass properly, you can get a few rides done very quickly.  Yes, you will need to standby on a couple, but what are people expecting, its a major theme park. The rides were brilliant and worth the wait. Add the excellent parade, and we had a great time, and my 9 year old son reckoned it was one of his best days. The only negative is that I don't think I could go to another theme park, as its hard to see how this experience can be bettered."
2929,5,13-Jun,United Kingdom,Well worth it,"Had a fantastic day at Disneyland Tokyo. I would recommend buying the tickets beforehand to avoid one of the many queues and also avoiding weekends as they are reportedly uber busy. I got a slight discount (5500 yen each instead of 6300 yen) from buying it a nearby convenience store.I went with my girlfriend on a Friday and turned up roughly half an hour early which helped avoid a bit of the queue to enter. The queues would vary with the big ones being mostly between 30 and 60 minutes. When I saw queue times of greater than that I would just move on to something else and come back later.Also making use the the fast pass system early on really helps. (Free tickets to jump some of the queue that everyone can get a limited number of but are limited to getting one every few hours. They can be found near most of the major attractions - ask the staff if you can't find them). Note they do run out over the course of the day so start early!The rides themselves were fantastic with amazingly detailed animatronic characers and a wide variety of ride intensities for differing tastes. The Monsters Inc and Winnie the Pooh rides were particularly good and had lines to reflect this (both 75 minutes plus) however I went to them late in the day and queued for a relatively painless 40 and 15 minutes respectively.Philharmagic was also a rather impressive multisensory cinema show.I would not recommend seeing Captain EO unless you are a big Michael Jackson fan or very nostalgic for the 80s esthetic which this film screams. MJ can dance but he can't act for toffee, and his many ugly puppet costars are charmless, annoying and stupid, looking like a particularly ham fisted attempted by George Lucas to sell tat to young children. The whole thing feels like a bloated, expensive extended music video/vanity project.Maybe you could enjoy this if your shick is seeing movies that are 'so bad they're good' but even then it is a waste of limited time that could be spent elsewhere in disneyland.My GF slept for the duration, I was not so lucky.All in all one I felt one day was enough, having managed to check out pretty much all of the big attractions and a few of the lesser ones too, although two days would allow you to be in less of a rush and see more/repeat the ones you like. All in all it was a real pleasure that I would recommend to anyone.I have been told that if you like this you should try disney sea as it is reportedly very similar but with the addition of alcohol being permitted!"
2930,5,13-Jun,Singapore,Always a fan of Disneyland,"A lot of reviews much have mentioned that the wait is ridiculous for each ride here.Well, we went on a Monday and a non-school holiday so although it was crowded, it wasn't that long a wait say 50-60 mins, as shared, per ride. Not sure if we were lucky.  We did go against the usual flow of starting the park with Adventureland instead of Tomorrowland. But the wait was mostly between 10-30 mins per ride at most. Tho I must admit the longest one was worth the wait indeed 70 mins - a photo with Mickey Mouse at his home in Toontown and Monster Inc.  Otherwise, we have actually managed rides which took us less than 7 mins wait. We certainly enjoyed ourselves there and stayed til 10 pm it's closing time. But yeah we intentionally missed some rides especially in Toontown  cos it's a little too kiddy for our children. The achievement was to cover at least 80-90 % of Tokyo Disneyland reputed for it's crowd. And overall, it's a great experience still. Tips : If you miss the first round, you can meet Mickey and Minnie at the entrance at 11.55 am near the park's entrance. Also, do not delay getting out of Disneyland after closing time as the last train leaves Maihama not long after.Enjoy Disney!!!"
2931,4,13-Apr,Singapore,For the young and young at heart,"We had a great day at Tokyo Disneyland. You can't not have a good day here. There is just something 'Magical' about the place. All of the staff are beyond friendly, they just go out of their way to 'make' the experience. It's exceptionally clean, has reasonably (theme-park) priced food and snacks, and just small enough to do in one day (2 days if you want to do the DisneySea bit, which we didn't). Family friendly, with the Log Ride and Splash Mountain being the only 2 real 'thrill' rides- but they are definitely fun and popular! Get a Fast Pass for these ones, well worth the wait of ~ 2-4hrs+ each!Oh, and about those fast passes, you can only have one (1) at a time! So get there early, pick your 'must-do' rides, grab a fastpass from the machine (next to the ride queue) for the next available- then as soon as you have done that one, get the pass for the next one and so on. The time in between can be spent on other, smaller/shorter wait rides. :)Free (included) travel on the JR Keiyo/Chuo lines, via Tokyo Station to Maihama (Disneyland)- allow at least 20mins each way. Definitely recommend buying a pre-paid day entry pass in advance, and go on a weekday to avoid the long lines!"
2932,5,13-Apr,Thailand,Fun day at one of the Best Disneys,"It is very easy to reach Tokyo Disneyland by train.  From Tokyo station, take the JR Keiyo line and get off at Maihama.  If in Shinjuku area, take the JR Chou line to Tokyo station and connect with the Keiyo line.  If you have a JR Rail Pass (highly recommended) then these trips are free, covered by the pass.  In my opinion this is one of the best Disney parks that I have visited.  There are 2 areas to the park, the DisneySea park and of course Disneyland park.  On the day we were there, they were offering senior tickets to anyone over 40 years old, I think to celebrate there 30th anniversary.  Adult ticket prices 6,200 Yen, senior 5,500 Yen.  The park is large but well layed out in a huge circle shape so going from one area to the next will literally bring you around and back to the front gate.  We arrived early and had ease in moving around the park, including rides and events.  There were no extraordinary long lines until middle afternoon when many school groups showed up. The restaurants were not overpriced, and we ate at Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall.  Cafeteria style but basic selections all fresh and served to you by friendly and helpful staff.  Every employee we came in contact with, from ticket counter to people at the rides and in the parades exuded an exciting and friendly attitude, and it certainly made for an enjoyable day.  The park was very clean, the grounds were immaculate, with an abundance of flowers, manicured grass and trees.  The restrooms (toilets) were very clean and well maintained.  There were 2 parades, one at mid day and the Electrical Night parade after dark.  I have been to Tokyo Hong Kong which is very good also, but Tokyo is much larger, more room to move around with the large crowds and more eating options.  Beware of the souvenir shops.  They were packed with so many people, it was difficult to even browse, not to mention buy something.  Not sure why, the prices were outrageous.  A fun day for the entire family."
2933,2,13-Mar,Australia,5 hours queuing? no way!,"Oh what a waste! We arrived around 11am and left around 5pm on late March. It was raining both days (Disneyland and Disney Sea) but the worse came when we wanted to do the rides. There were just a few of them which had still fast track but take a ticket to do the ride 7 or 8 hours after?, that means you have to stay the whole day only for one ride!. If you want to have another ride chances are that you might not get the fast track ticket because it's over, so you have to queue between 3 and 5 hours, meaning that your day is gone on the line for a single ride.Food is t e r r i b l e!!!!!! not even the beautiful turkey legs are good. We went to Disney Sea the day after but this time we took our own food which we loved.I've been in Disney Orlando, L.A. and Hong Kong and this is the worse. We didn't enjoy it at all and thought it was a waste of time as there is absolutely nothing good about this park. Have I mentioned the shops? the only things you find there is the Duffy Bear, not nice clothes or magnets or caps, nothing!"
2934,5,12-Jul,Switzerland,lovely place,"disneyland tokyo was my first disneyland ever.. what's amazing, everything was perfect even the popcorns you can find in a lot of differents flavour..I really enjoyed that park, i also went in california.. but in my opinion in Tokyo is much better!!If you go to Tokyo don't forget to go Disneyland"
2935,5,13-Jun,Australia,It's great to walk in a childs shoes again,"Initially I was put off visiting tokyo Disney but the multitude of reviews saying this is one of the busiest theme parks in the world ; The queues are out of control and the heat is terrible.  So it was fair to say that we were definitely skeptical about whether or not we should take the risk with our 2.5 year old and 9mth old and step through those turnstiles.  I mean honestly would you do it when your toddler resembles something of an out of control labrador on speed chasing a squeaky toy in a sea of Japanese children who seem to sit like dosile 20 year old well trained Poodles? I say no....However our hotel heavily marketed the park and offered a free bus too and from the facility which would save a train ride.  Now we are pretty good with trains and have managed to get around all over the world however refer back to 2.5 year old speed driven lab comment and envision said child swinging from the suspended handles after a day full of excitement and sugar.... Nightmare.When we arrived the park had been open for an hour so there were no queues upon entry (an excellent sign!) the park is currently decked out in its 30th anniversary theme and one you enter the park a feeling of childlike wonderment and happiness swarms over you like happy little tinkerbells.  Clearly a strong marketing team has designed Disney and u walk straight into a plethora of gift stalls which you initially say why the hell would anyone want this crap.....I mean really a Minnie Mouse sundress?  (Watch this space) but you are struck by the fact everyone is wearing some sort of Disney headress and suddenly the urgency to fit in takes over and before you know it you are adorned in Micky ears, goofy hat and said Minnie sundress.  This is the cleanest theme park I have ever been to.  The toilets? Immaculate.  The grounds? Not a blade of grass out of place (my toddler tried to scale a fence at one stage to play on the grass it was that nice.). I'm not sure if it was the day we went (Wednesday in off peak season) or the fact we only stayed in the childrens section (magic kingdom and toontown) but the longest we waited for a ride all day was 20mins.  This was perfectly acceptable to me and as such we had an amazing day.  Teacups rides, dumbo rides and a somewhat disturbingly scary Snow White ride were had by all (even the 9mth old went on everything which I found hilarious). Worth noting - the roller coaster in toontown has height restrictions - my 2.5 year old met this restriction but wasn't allowed on as she wasn't three - we snuck back later (coz hey who wouldn't remember the family of four white people with blonde haired blue eyed children in central japan) and said she was three and got on - absolutely loved it so remember to say your child is three!!I would also like to note that if ur children do stick out (as mine did like a pair chuck Taylor cons in a louboutin boutique) be prepared to make them shine for the day.  They will be photographed and posed with more than the Jolie-Pitt brood on a field trip.  In fact at one stage the queue for pictures with my girls was longer than that of goofy and Pluto! A definite must we loved seeing this park through the eyes of our girls and will return in a heartbeat next time we visit tokyo!"
2936,5,12-Aug,Singapore,The BEST Disney park in the whole wide world!!!,"Good:-In 1998, TDL celebrated its 15th anniversary & I could feel the Disney spirit vibrating in the air! Even in 2012, my recent visit, the fun never ends at this Japanese park!-Even with minimal Japanese, communication is not a problem, you are guaranteed a great time inside the park!-The best thing about this park are the live shows, the energy from the performers are just as good as those seen on Broadway!!!Bad:-Massive crowds.-Merchandise isn't cheap.-Difficult to find seating at restaurants during peak hours."
2937,4,13-Jun,United States,Great park!,"This is an excellent theme park.  It is well maintained, reasonably priced, and probably the best example of a Disneyland-style park.  A really fun place to explore!"
2938,5,12-Aug,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Fantastic Time,"My boys loved this adventure. Granted, I still wonder what is the use to going to Disney more than once or twice but my boys never seem to tire of it so as long as they are enjoying it we will continue to go. We have never been to any other Disney resort so we have no comparison but fun is fun and that it is. The parades are a blast and the rides are good for the kids. The smiles on my babies faces are worth more than the costs (which are ridiculous)."
2939,4,13-Jun,Japan,Better Late than never- reliving my childhood!,"2 weeks ago I went with an adult friend to Tokyo Disneyland. This was my first experience of a Disneyland anywhere in the world and I absolutely loved it. I had read the earlier reviews about the enormous ques and yes, they are a drag and do diminish the experience. Were it not for the ques I would have rated Disneyland a 5. However with some forward planning you can reduce your que times significantly on several popular rides. We reviewed the maps and attractions before we went and all this information is easily accessible on the website in English. We also knew from reviewing other traveller's reviews which rides are the most popular. So when we got there at 8:30 am when the doors opened, we raced to the most popular ride and got a ""fast pass"". Fast pass tickets are available at the location of the ride/attraction from a machine by scanning the barcode of your ticket . It will provide you with an allocated timeframe/slot to come back and go on the ride without having to que. These are VERY worthwhile but unfortunately you can only get 1 fast pass at a time. ie you wont get issued a second fast pass until you have used the one you have. So go to you fave ride and get a fastpass. In the meantime as you wait for that time slot go to another attraction and que. Some ques for the less popular rides are much shorter. The bad news is that the number of fast passes for each popular ride is limited and run out by mid morning (ie because all the time slots for the entire day get issued)- you may for example get a fast pass asking you to come back between 6:30-7:30pm at night that you obtained in the morning! The rides for which the fast passes are issued are marked on the attractions map and the most popular rides for which you need to try and get a fastpass are Space Mountain, Star Tours, Poo's Honey Pot. If you are really organised and prepared to que, you can get on a lot of rides if you go on a weekday that is not a holiday. We went on a Thursday and went on over 12 attractions but it was a fall day and we left at 9:45pm.My favourite attractions were Ghost Mansion, Pirates of The Caribbean, Its a Small World and Space Mountain although the latter was probably the one that I would least recommend for kids or those who get queasy on rides as you are essentially on a rollercoaster with lots of twists and turns and it is all happening in the dark.The people are polite, the park is so clean and there are heaps of restaurants and food stalls. I disagree with other travellers' reviews that the food is bad. We bought snacks to eat when queing for rides and also ate lunch and dinner and felt the food was fine (other than the coffee!). Do yourself a favour and try the curry popcorn- i will never eat plain popcorn again!There are heaps of shops to buy merchandise within Disneyland and you will be surprised by how many Japanese adults there are walking around in Disney clothing and accessories. Many go all out including the guys! People watching is part of the fun! Also try and stay for the night parade as that was excellent- lots of floats lit up with lights- magical! As for the other shows, you need to go to a lottery system booth and scan you ticket to see if you will be issued with a ticket to see one of the shows. We lucked out and I have to say that was the moment when Disneyland was about unhappiness for us! We were pretty disappointed but just got on with getting on rides and watching the daytime parade and seeing the brass band performance on the street. Tickets to Disneyland are available in advance from Lawson Convenience stores and the ticket prices includes access to all the rides. Disneyland is accessible by train but we drove and parking cost 2000 yen for the day. Outside the complex are heaps of hotels and a big shopping centre but we didn't have time to visit them!All in all it was a long, tiring but fabulous day full of fun and I will be back to visit Disney Sea next"
2940,2,13-May,Malaysia,Disneyland Tokyo - Where queues never cease,"Brought my kids here, expecting the same thing as Disneyland Hong Kong. Was totally wrong. Had managed to spend a whole day in Disneyland HK taking in most of the rides without any problems few years ago. However, here it was terrible.Expect to queue for hours on end here. We came in early but all the good rides showed 150 - 200 minutes waiting time. Not sure if we had made a mistake by coming during the weekend but our guide said that even weekdays are also packed.The long queue just spoils the mood but have to respect the locals whom seem not to notice the queues. A true test of patience for me and the kids, with them wailing, how much longer..."
2941,5,13-May,United States,Unbelievable Place to Visit,"Okay it's Japan, but even with the language barrier this place was so enjoyable.  I was pretty skeptical after reading the reviews about long lines and crowds.  With that in mind my friend and I decided well hopefully we'll get onto at least 2 rides and just enjoy the park the rest of the day.  But soon those myths would just be just myths and we ended up going on many more rides.First, the people in Japan take Disney to a new level.  What we noticed was people were willing to wait for hours for the park to open (and that's no joke!)  What we noticed is that the park opened at 8:30, and the parking lot opened at 5:30am!  The cars were coming in one after the other.  So you want to know how to plan your day.  Well here's ours.  Because we were staying on sight we would get to enter the park a whole 15mins prior to the general public (not much).   We went to stand in line about 1 hour before opening.  The people who were already in line were orderly and patient.  So don't worry about pushing.  There were around 8 lines so the line we stood made us about the 6th to enter.Second, plan where you want to go ahead of time, you can download the English version of the park and where the rides are located.  What we decided was to hit Tomorrowland first, and choose the ride we want to be on.  We choose Monsters Inc.  Once we finished the ride we went and got a fastpass to Buzz Lightyear, and had my friends mom and Aunt head off to Fantasyland to go onto the Pooh' Hunny Hut and to catch Mickey's Philharmagic (they are in their late 70's).  Since the line was getting long for Star Tours we decided to pass and catch up with her family.  Pooh's Hunny Hut is a must!  We then decided to ride the rides in Fantasyland and enjoy ourselves and ride whatever rides were moving until it was time to return for our fastpass time.  We did the Buzz Lightyear ride, and then went and got another fastpass to another ride.  Remember once the time has passed, you can get another one.What we learned in our short time there was that the Japanese people will ride any ride no matter what the age.  It didn't matter if they had children or not.  And what we did was just that.  Yes, the lines can and will be long, but if you plan your day right you can get on almost any ride with very little wait.  There were lines that were showing a 70 minutes wait but we didn't care.  My advice is to go in there with an open mind.  Yeah, you're not going to get onto every single ride you wanted to get on, but hey, plan, plan and plan again.  If you go in with an idea of what you want, you will get to do more rides than you expected.  I remember the wait at Disney World was just as bad.  The best part was that we were staying on site so we were able to take a break and come back again to enjoy the rest of the park.  We got onto many rides and enjoyed every minute.  As for the park, it is very clean, and the workers were cordial and helpful.  Make to doubt about it we will be going back again."
2942,3,13-May,United Kingdom,Worth it but only just,"This was my first (and possibly last) trip to a Disney park. We went at end of May so Golden Week holiday had passed and it was before rainy/summer season started which is supposedly a 'quieter' time.  In reality, I don't think there is a quiet time or if this was it then I can't imagine it at peak time because it was packed with 2-3 hour queues for all the prime rides. We got a fastpass ticket for the Star Wars ride at 10am which meant we had to return at 8.30pm to skip the first part of the queue (we still queued for about 15mins). We tried to get fastpass for the Monsters Inc ride next to it but it only offered tickets around same time as our Star Wars one so it wouldn't give us one. All other rides had no more fastpass tickets available so you either run in there at 8am and get fastpass for your favourites or be prepared to queue and manage about 5-6 rides a day. The shortest queues without a fastpass were around 40mins.  The food is awful in there though that's pretty much what I was expecting.  The rides are good when you do manage to get on them, the new Star Wars one being a personal highlight. My daughter loved the Monsters Inc ride though she did have to wait till 9.50pm to do it which was quite tough for a 4 year old. We also enjoyed the night parade."
2943,4,13-Apr,Japan,For kids and kids at heart,definitely a must see if in Tokyo area.  Disneyland is very kid friendly so go take your kids and enjoy all the attractions offered.
2944,5,13-May,Malaysia,a fantasy place for my 3 yr old,Just loved it. My daughter had so much fun in Disneyland. She wore Cinderella costume and was greeted with so much welcome from the Disneyland staff befitted of  Disney Princess :)
2945,3,13-Mar,Australia,what you expect!,"Lovely place but wow! Most rides had lines for up to 3hours!Suggestion is to get there very early, like exactly when the gates open, plan what rides you want to go on before hand, get a fastpass for one ride and go line up. I personally thought it was a waste of time and waiting in lines made me cranky lol. Enjoy"
2946,1,13-May,Singapore,"Queue, Queue, Queue & More Queue","I think this is should not be called Tokyo Disneyland. They should consider renaming it to Disney Sham. To shorten my review, I will just list down what I liked and disliked.Like: - Clean place - Staff had great attitude and friendly - the parade was quite spectacular  - very cheap entrance, it is only about USD 60 (6200 Yen) and if you get a 2 day pass, it is only 10,700 yenDislike: - over crowded. I was advised by the hotel staff that 22 May 13 (Wed)    was a super low season, but when I was there, I was simply overwhelmed by the enormous crowd. I just could not imagine what it would be like if it was a high season.- the loooong queue if you want to do a ride. Fastpasses were quickly depleted by 2 pm for some rides.For one ride, even if you can get a Fastpass at 11.15 am, the time to return for the ride was 6.55 pm. It is almost an 8 hour wait. Pl do not be encouraged by other reviews stating that they were able to do certain popular rides several times, this is just NOT possible. Some rides had queue waiitng time of at least 50 mins while the popular ones 150 to 170 mins.- food quality mediocre at bestIf you intend to do the rides, then this park will sure disappoint. If standing for hours and hours in the queue is your kind of thing, then you will love Tokyo Disneyland. I left after doing 2 rides as I think there are plenty of other things to do than to wastetime standing in the queue.Tips: apply sunblock or bring an umbrella as the queue areas beyond 30 mins waiting time are mostly not sheltered. So if the queue is 3 hours long, you will be standing in the sun for 2.5 hours."
2947,5,12-Jun,Singapore,I am a child again!,"I never been a great fan of DIsney until i stepped in here.It just bring my childhood into reality!Had a lot of fun, walking around, finding mascots, taking pictures.Even the staffs are awfully friendly that I love them!always smiling and always so welcoming.SPend at least one day there."
2948,4,13-May,Philippines,Quality Entertainment,"We went there at around lunch time - which is not good... If your'e planning to experience all the rides & the shows, be there at around 8am as the average waiting time is around 30-45 minutes per ride...Front gate personnels don't have an english Disney Land Guide Map unlike Disney Sea. The park is well maintained - no garbages, smokers have their own stations & the people (Japanese) are very disciplined - no one will get ahead of you in line, they won't stand up at the middle of a show etc etc.. We also went to Star Trek tours - a new ride/attraction in disneyland which opened last May 7 (we went there on May 10). The queue's too long, you have to wait for 2hrs or more (this is usually the case for newly opened rides)..even the FASTPASS IS NOT THAT FAST - we got our FP tickets at around lunch, the FP ticket time was at 7-8pm just to ride this one. The effects/place was really impressive & there were moving R2d2 & C-3PO which is kinda cool even if you're not a star wars  fan. The only downside overall is that all shows are in Japanese language - which makes some of the shows, well, a little boring cause you can't understand a single thing :( We also had the chance to see (reserved seating) One Man's Dream (stage performance) & the stage effects, props, choreography are really amazing - it compensates for the language barrier...lol! BTW, If you have kids with you, bring your own stroller instead of renting one (expensive!)."
2949,4,13-May,United Kingdom,"Another Disney, another Continent","I have visited Disney in Florida and Disney near Paris, both times with my kids. This time it was Disney , Tokyo with my Grandson and his Mum. On the face of it, they were all very similar with the same attractions. Disney Tokyo is on a smaller site. The good news was shorter walking between rides, the bad is the queues seemed much longer. Maybe it was just very busy, but judging by the car park and what I have been told, this was a quiet Friday! I suppose I should also say that my grandson is only 2 1/2 years old and in all honesty 2 years too young. Don't get me wrong he loved it especially the electric parade, but queuing for 40 minutes is really too much to ask of him. The Disney theme continues to endure and it's pretty much a standard product. This was a shame because Tokyo could have been more Japanese and less American and been the better for it. The food was US and not up to standard. Take your own and save a fortune, as many Japanese visitors did. To really get the best from Disney you need to plan carefully. Start EARLY and hit the most popular rides while the queue is short. Lunchtime people are eating so eat earl (or late) and make the most of the slack time. Don't take your own buggy, hire one. Though expensive it's still a fantastic day you will never forget whatever age you are. Finally one strange thing about Tokyo is the number of unaccompanied adults. It seems no matter how old we all enjoy the magic, just glad I had my grandson to superviseüòé"
2950,4,13-May,United Kingdom,Disney style with Japanese substance,"I visited here back in 1996 and a lot has changed since then. A monorail has appeared, several hotels and a whole new park 'Disneysea'. I have fond memories of this park as it was actually the first one I ever visited. I still think it probably has the best 'Castle' of any of the 'Magic Kingdom' parks.Ride wise it has Space and Splash mountains, the haunted house, Pirates of the Caribbean, Winnie the Pooh, Big thunder mountain and a few other ones. Space mountain, out of all the worlds non-inverting one's I reckon this one is by far the best, it's in total darkness where as some of the others leak a lot of light. Winnie the Pooh is also different from other versions and is technologically very advanced. Haunted house and other rides are pretty identical to other world versions. 'It's a small world' is just as irritating here as it is anywhere else.What sets this park apart though is the parades and the shear attention to detail. Can you imagine being in a USA park and everyone sitting down nicely when told to do so? We were sat about 15 feet from the rope yet still had a great view as everyone was just so well behaved. You have the feeling that if someone stood up at the wrong time an impeccable dressed employee would develop a Samurai sword from nowhere and a head would roll. Coming from the west it's just very different but it's beautiful to be a part of and appreciate it all. The attention to detail is stunning in all aspects, be it the parade or even just the servers in a 'Churro' truck. You will not find an employee that can't speak at least two languages and all were very forgiving and understanding of my very bad Japanese pronunciation (although I get the feeling that they do appreciate the effort, even if they do confirm what you've asked for in English). We experienced impeccable service and politeness during our entire stay. If you get the opportunity to come here, do, you will not regret the experience. It contains nothing really new if you've experienced the other parks in the world, but the people do separate this one apart. "
2951,4,13-Apr,Singapore,When you wish upon a star...,"In April 2013, we visited Disneyland Tokyo for the first time. As expected, most of the attractions are quite similar with the one in Paris. But the most challenging (and quite annoying part) is that they are using Japanese in most of the attractions. So if you are not native speakers or fluent in Japanese, maybe you won't be really enjoying much.Apart from the language barrier, you may not see any unique collections of souvenirs as you can find easily in Paris. They are very standard items such as clothings, toys, stationeries etc.Since we went there during weekdays, the queue was not so long. In average, we could 'enjoy' around 40 minutes of waiting time.Overall we are still satisfied with our visit to Disneyland Tokyo, as it's one of our favourite places. We surely come back again in the future."
2952,5,13-Apr,United States,Disney level quality with Japanese attention to detail!,"Having visited both Disneyland and Disney World in the U.S., I had high hopes for this park. I was not disappointed.  Remember this is like Disneyland, in that it is only the Magic Kingdom with its different 'lands' (Tomorrowland, etc).  The park is immaculate and has all the feel and magic that Disneyland should.  This is its 30th year, so all merchandise is labeled as such.  The Japanese LOVE their Disney products!My daughter just turned three, and this was her first Disney experience.  I think we were more excited than she was however!Most employees spoke very good English and were very good at answering questions regarding parade times, etc.  I think that the employees here are more attentive and 'magical' than their U.S. counterparts...which says a lot because they are all very good.  When it came time for parades, they were very good at marshaling off the areas and keeping order.  They have areas a certain distance from the ropes that are for sitting only, to ensure everyone can see.  After that, it is standing only. The parades are long and very spectacular!  Especially the night time electrical parade!  Also noteworthy is the stroller parking.  You leave the stroller outside of the attraction.  Employees keep the area tidy and there is no fear of theft whatsoever.Perhaps my memory of the U.S. parks is failing me, but it seemed that here in Tokyo, many of the rides (Snow White, Roger Rabbit, etc) were a bit too scary for young children.  They were pretty intense and 'dark' which scared the bejezzus out of my toddler.The food was fantastic and actually reasonably priced.  The park itself was 6200Y ($68 UDS) per adult.  It was well worth it and I would go back again!  This is an all-day affair!To get here by the trains, take the JR Yamanote Line (or metro) to Tokyo station.  From there, transfer to JR Keiyo Line to the Maihama station.  The park entrance is a short walk from the train station.  After walking off of the pedestrian bridge, stay to the right and you will see the ticket booths."
2953,3,13-Apr,Malaysia,"Another park , another shopping mall !","Definately for the younger generation , me n wife in our 50's just took a stroll and a ride on the Disney train circuling the resort. You will need a full day in the resort n I do not have the 'energy' to circle the resort nor handle  the rides . But the shopping mall was great , 4 levels including restaurants. Went to the CROC shoes outlet , they have the latest designs n reasonable price too .Me n wife bought a pair each. Nice flowery gardens , good to snaps memory photos. Easy access , as the train stops at Maihama station within the Resort grounds."
2954,5,13-Apr,Australia,Wonderful day out!,"My husband and our two adult daughters (aged 30 and 32) spent an absolutely fantastic day at Disneyland. It was certainly a full day. We arrived at Disneyland at about 8.30am and did not have to queue very long for tickets, so we were in the park just after 9 and did not leave until just after closing time (10pm). I am sure that if the park had been open until later our daughters would have had us there even longer as we were all having such a good time.We went on a Tuesday and were pleasantly surprised at the length of the queues. The longest we had to queue up for was about 30mins. Our usual wait was only 15-20mins and there were many times when it was even shorter than this. We did make use of the Fast Pass system twice. We did all of the rides that we wanted to (and that was most of them) and many rides multiple times, e.g. we did the Splash Mountain ride 3 times.As other reviewers have commented it is a very clean park (just like the rest of Japan really) and the rides are fantastic. Our favourites would have to be Splash Mountain and the Winnie the Pooh ride (how those cars work is fascinating). As has also been mentioned one of the best times to ride is while the parades are on as the queues are much shorter. At these times we could often just walk up to rides. We still saw a fair bit of the night parade because we went on rides near and/or overlooking the parade.Overall, a fantastic day out and a real highlight of our trip to Japan."
2955,5,N/A,N/A,The Pooh ride!,"What can I say, it's Disneyland. It was a fun experience and we must have gone on a great day, because the lines were not outrageous. My favorite ride was the Winnie the Pooh. It was really well done, as interesting on how it worked. Very well done!  I was really excited to see the electrical light parade, but unfortunalty it got really windy which caused the cancelation of the parade. Overall great experience."
2956,5,13-Mar,Australia,tokyo disneyland,"Tokyo disneyland was unbelievably excellent, especially the parade of disney cartoon characters at nitefall.Beautiful gardens and scenery.Recommend you put a whole day/niight aside for this experience."
2957,4,13-Apr,N/A,Good Place To Visit!,"Had a good trip with my wife there and actually spent the whole day there. Had a few rides and the Star Tour was a ride not to miss. However, it was so confusing when finding the actual place to buy entrance tickets to go into Disneyland and there were no staffs there to assist. Waste a bit of time there."
2958,5,13-Apr,United Kingdom,Such fun to try new rides!,"Unlike any other Disney park - new rides we didn't know from elsewhere, brilliant mythical show on the lake - great day out!"
2959,5,13-Apr,Philippines,nice disney park,clean park... nice shows... beautiful magical night parade.  Typical of Japanese culture...clean and meticulously well made park with great rides and shows.
2960,5,13-Apr,United States,The best Winnie the Pooh ride anywhere,"It seems like a normal dark ride, but then you notice that there is no track.  The part were you bounce and then the ride vehicles dance around each other is amazing.  The rest of the park is just as nice.  This park has some other unique attractions not found at any other Disney park."
2961,3,13-Mar,United Kingdom,Disneyland Sea,"Spent a very long day here at Disney Sea in the rain! Long ques and not the best, but you have to do it. The rides we did get on were fun. The food was ok but I think the weather did not help the visit. Even in Winter its full of people!!!!"
2962,4,13-Mar,Malaysia,Neat and Clean Disneyland,"Getting to Disneyland Tokyo is very easy by train. From Tokyo station to Maihama station only takes about 20 minutes. Everything was so nice, including rides, shows, parade, and fireworks. All employees of Disneyland are helpful and polite. I am impressed that they maintain it so neat and clean. My kids love it so much. Only thing was there were too many visitors and queues were quite long that day. Anyway, we had a great time at Disneyland. "
2963,5,12-May,Finland,Superb,"The roller coaster was superb, the best ever, but the queue to it much too long!! Nice and tidy place."
2964,5,12-May,China,great place for children and family,a very nice place. Would be perfect for family and children. The staffs are super friendly and nice. Would love to visit again~
2965,4,13-Apr,Australia,Busy but worth it,"It is certainly very busy but everyone is so polite and friendly. We managed 3 fast passes in a day. We were not prepared to wait more than an hour in a line. I needed to remind the family that Disney is a theme park not a Fun park, ie not about the rides. We LOVE that prices of food inside the park is reasonable and there are water bubblers everywhere and free iced water in restaurants - unlike in Aussie parks where they charge thru the roof for water. sorry I Can't write more but this is from my phone which is too hard to type from"
2966,5,12-Dec,Malaysia,Packed during weekends,"My latest trip to Disneyland was quite dissapointed this time.There's too many people. We were travelling with small children and we can only allocate our visit to Disneyland on Saturday.However Disneyland is still in our heart at its best. I have been to Tokyo Disneyland and Disneysea several times and I love it in each visits.My advice is do go to Disneyland during weekdays and avoid during any public holidays, Golden Week holidays, Obon Holidays and new Year holidays to enjoy the rides. If not, the queu will be like 100mins, 120mins and you have to run to get the special express pass when the Disneyland gates open."
2967,1,13-Apr,United Kingdom,Crazy overcrowded and under-served.,"It is shocking to me that anyone can give this resort anything but a terrible score. Disney have been greedy and irresponsible letting in about 5 times more people than the park can realistically serve. Having queues as long as 4 hours in the blistering sun for a single 10-minute ride is not only a terrible experience, it should be illegal. While the queues are very civilized and well organized in classic Japanese style, no amount of red tape will ever cover up the fact that Disney have been abusing park attendees with it's admittance policies.Having just returned from a two-day foray into the resort I can't recommend enough that people STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS HOLE. The amount of people meant that it was near impossible to move around, let alone get on any rides. Forget about FastPasses too because by 10:30 most of them were gone and the queues at the ticketing sections were full and closed. When you having 20 meter queues at your popcorn stands you know that you have an overcrowding problem and of course management was STILL selling more tickets and letting people come in. I felt like I was going crazy, queues started forming everywhere and for everything. Why the hell do the Japanese locals put up with this is beyond me, I guess it's a cultural difference. If you're not of a culture that imbues you with interminable patience DO NOT GO TO THIS PARK."
2968,3,13-Mar,Iran,Very crowded,I visited here in an ordinary day to prevent holiday crowdings. Before the noon it was acceptable however it was getting crowded at afternoon and you have to stay in long queues to be able to visit a place. It was rainy and relatively cold too and It seems to be better to visit after mid April as the schools are open at this time in Japan and the weather is warmer you may expect a better experience.
2969,1,13-Feb,Australia,Very disappointed - Lines of Lemmings,"This was rather a painful experience.Once I reached the park it seemed to be a quiet day when there was no waiting for tickets. But once I was in, it was a swarm of people.Although the staff are very friendly and the park is exceptionally clean, there are long queues for absolutely EVERYTHING including food, toilets, photo with characters and rides. For instance, we waited for over two hours for a two minute ride. Even souvenir shops are completely packed with people.Definitely a waste of money."
2970,5,12-Apr,Czechia,Unforgettable experience,"Excellent place to go, except for the queue. I was surprise with the queue because in Japan I've never seen long queues...  Just get the fastpass the ride you want first.It's a dream to be at Tokyo Disneyland!"
2971,1,N/A,Thailand,Painful experience - they should be ashamed.,The lines of people waiting for rides is horrible.  2+ hours waiting. They should be ashamed they are making people wait like this. Select one ride and you wait like cattle inching forward every minute or so.Fast past system is really bad as you ask for a fast pass and they tell you that there are no more available.  By far this place was my worst experience in Japan so far. Even the seating in cars on rides was too small to accommodate me.They didn't have characters walking around the park or entertainment while waiting in line either.  Found Disneyland in Anaheim much better.
2972,1,13-Mar,United Kingdom,Dreadful Experience,"This is Disney hell. We arrived late morning and we surprised how quiet it seemed. Little did we know? Having paid the entrance we walked into a maelstrom of people with 2+ hour queues and no fast passes remaining. At best we could have gone on a couple of attractions which for 10,000+ yen is terrible value. We demanded our money back which - to be fair - we got. Worth knowing if you feel duped."
2973,5,13-Mar,Australia,Better than Anaheim,"I'm on a mission to see all 5 Disneys and with Paris and Orlando left, I can safely safe this is the best so far.  But be warned, the crowds are more than anywhere else too.  Read up on Fastpass and pick the ride you want first and then go from there.  The park opens at 8 (well at this time of year it did) and I highly suggest being there then. Bring your own water, they don't sell it readily but there are bubblers if you're desperate.  Plus the Japanse put the 'amp' into camp when it comes to this sort of stuff.  Enjoy! "
2974,4,13-Mar,Panama,Looong Lines,This park is about the size of Disneyland California but with about 3 or four times as much people.  Frustrating
2975,4,N/A,Singapore,Great sights,"The architect are great. Its very magical & happy but the long queue did kill my mood. We were not able to complete the rides as some rides can give u a good waiting time of 3 hours. So we focus on the magical feelings & go for rides that have shorter queues. I would like to give credit to the people working in Disneyland! During a 45 mins queue, the rides in charge did songs, raps & riddles to engage the queuers. The cleaners offered to load the trash off my hand while I was walking around. But as compared to Disneysea, I think Disneysea is a better choice."
2976,5,13-Jan,Singapore,Always a dream!,"Our kids made it clear that every trip to Tokyo must include the famous theme park.  We came again in January particularly to also cover the Monster Inc. Ride which is similar to that in California and not available in Paris or Hong Kong.  It was one of the park's favourite attraction along with  Winnie the Pooh Ride etc. so go get a Fast Pass in advance.  Do note that you can only get one Fast Pass at a time.  The crowd in Tokyo Disneyland can be overwhelming as it is very popular among Asian tourists and local Japanese.  Best to visit Monday to Thursday and plan ahead where to go.  We managed to cover a record 11 rides this time!  Do check ahead at the website for locations of the special events.  The Nightime Parade is quite spectacular but it's freezing cold in winter so be prepared with warm clothing's.  Don't be surprised with a fair bit of shopping as the merchandise here are quite attractive with some unique items available or being sold here first.  Departing from the theme park, we find it easier to take the Disneyland bus rather the train where you need to walk some 15-20min (with kids) to reach the station.  However, do know the bus timetable ahead and you may need to arrive early to get seats."
2977,4,12-Oct,Indonesia,Disneyland in October,"We went here last year on the 4th of October 2012 (Thursday). I am myself a huge Disney fan, and have been to Tokyo Disneyland before. This is my 5th visit, but it's my 1st visit with my 3 year old son. Things are obviously different with a small kid in tow, we move in a slower pace but nevertheless the experience is still very fun and entertaining for all of us. You can rent a stroller/pram there for about ¬•700 for a whole day. We brought our own pram though.. For those with smaller babies, there's two baby centers.. One in Toon Town and the other in World Bazaar (just before Tomorrowland) and you can use the microwave there, nurse your baby or request for hot water for the baby's formula. There's always a stroller parking spot in almost every ride, so you can park your stroller there.We arrived at about 9ish (we didn't go early to wait at the entrance before opening time) and had a light breakfast first there - I would recommend to arrive earlier and have breakfast beforehand to save time though. We planned to do this, but as some of you may know, with kids sometimes things just doesn't go as planned. =) The queue in the morning is bearable, we waited for about 5 to 25 minutes maximum to go on the rides. The more popular rides have longer waiting time. In the afternoon, the queue times become longer (about 60 minutes+++). Perhaps more people come to the park after school/work? However we got to ride all of the rides we wanted to go on in one day, which is good. Totally different story with Disney Sea the next day, but that's a whole other review to write. Everything is very clean here, food is your average theme park quality (but cuter). Everyone is very friendly and happy to help.Long queue to meet and greet the characters, especially Micky and Minnie.TIP: if you can, check when and what day you will be at TDL. School Holidays, public holidays and weekends need to be avoided at all cost (unless you want to wait for 2-3 hrs for each ride), and the day before and after long weekend.Generally saying, the safest day to go is either a Wednesday or Thursday. There's a website that predicts how crowded TDL and TDS will be, but it's in Japanese."
2978,4,12-Dec,Australia,"You can't go wrong with Disney, except for line though.","There isn't much to say about DisneyLand Tokyo, it's DisneyLand but mostly in Japanese but everyone is nice. Getting there is fairly easy by train, not sure how the bus is. Now, because I live in Australia, I got very excited that I was going to DisneyLand and because I was alone, I could go on any ride I wanted, talk about a day being a kid!My sister went to DisneyLand in America a few months before so the rides were similar except a few were different, I believe the Monsters Inc ride was different. The lines were long, but that is to be expected from any DisneyLand. If you like DisneyLand type parks, then you'll love this one. Like the big tourist things in Japan, everything is in Japanese and English. If you go, obviously spend the whole day, get on as many rides as possible and watch the parades. Whilst I was there (early December 2012) there was a spectacular night parade where the floats were made up of led lights that would flash and change color. All in all, a great day, but try to stay away from the ""Western"" area if you're coming from Australia, USA, UK, etc as it's more for the Japanese and can be boring."
2979,1,13-Mar,Australia,Waste of time and money,"Who wants to wait for 2 hours for a ride that lasts less than 2 minutes? Queue up for expensive, garbage food? And the toilet? The whole thing overcrowded and over-priced. If you want a thrill, ride the Shinkansen."
2980,5,13-Jan,Australia,Disneyland and Disney Sea - a week in Jan,"Family of 9,  6 adults and three children under 4 spent a week in Jan this year. Th highlight was the snow which Tokyo had for the first time in a long time.. My four year old grandaughter loved meeting the characters. She had to wear a different princess dress each day. But was forced to wear her parka over the top. Can be icy cold especially at Disney Sea. She loved splash mountain and we all enjoyed the Monsters Ink ride.  The indoor children's area at Disney Sea is great to get away from the wind. Found the park to be so clean with fantastic amenities and reasonably priced meals. They even mad special meals for my coeliac grandaughter. A fantastic trip was had by all"
2981,4,N/A,N/A,Just enjoyable to be inside fun,"Get there early eg. Half hour before opening time. Shuttle bus depart most nearby hotel at good timing un the morning so u could get a good start from the long lines. Was actually late Jan when I was there and pretty cold on the outdoor rides. My son loved walking around donald's and minie's compound. Gingerbreadman roller coaster is a good one for preschoolers. The shrek show is pretty good too. Toy story attraction is pretty average tho. Train station was nice but views from the train not that fantastic. Had a hard time finding my way back to the Mystays Hotel as it was dark when we left so we took a long walk in the cold, passed the train station and all those japanese signs wasnt of much help. Would be nice to have English signboards showing location of major hotels to/from Disneyland. Overall, it is one of the major highlights in Tokyo and should not be missed."
2982,2,13-Feb,Japan,Disappointing- line ups atrocious,"Be warned!!!!!----February mid-week was traditionally a great time to go to Disneyland, as it was slow season and if you dressed warmly- you were set as the lines up would be reasonable. This is no longer the case. We went yesterday on a Thursday- parking lot looked fine but there were many buses entering. Park opened at 9 am, line ups were 2 to 3 hours long by 9:20 and fast passes were gone for the day or the lines ups for the fast passes were 30 minutes long.  The line up for Thunder Mountain went down the park past Bear Jamboree- 3 hours long. The line up for Buzz lite year- went around the Tomorrowland restaurant- a good 2 hours or more.  You pay for Disney so that you can go on the rides- with these line ups you would perhaps get  2 or 3 rides in a day and a few little ones like the merry-go-round.The park now has a student promotion during this time period, and does not seem to be limiting the amount of schools visiting. The park was ""swarming' with young people. Although happy for their day off from school, they all are going on the big name rides, there is no mix of visitors- leading to long wait times. They have over sold the bus tours to bring their revenue up. This spoiled the day for everyone- I am not paying to stand in line all day to do 3 rides in a day. This is unreasonable. I am not a money machine for Disney and that's how I felt. We are quite unlikely to return with our family to this Disney Park- a shame. But it is becoming impossible to find a medium crowd day anymore. Our money will be better spent at another Disney Park or a competitor."
2983,5,12-Dec,Australia,"Our 3rd Disneyland, but we had to go and loved it!","We visited Japan in December 2012 and even though we had already gone to Anaheim and Euro Disneylands, we decided to visit Tokyo Disneyland too.Wonderful experience, we ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.We did it in two days, as we already knew the rides we liked (from the other Disneylands). Contrary to other reviews, we didn't find it very crowded, although it was full with Japanese school students.We spent 2 full days (morning to night) and although winter in Japan, the experience was fabulous. The people were extremely helpful and it was one of the cleanest Disneylands we visited, And of course, safety was paramount, We never felt unsafe, anywhere in Japan and especially Disneyland.High recommended for anyone to visit, young or old!!!"
2984,5,12-Apr,United States,Loved it!,"We visited Tokyo Disney as a group which included myself, my husband, our 3 year old son, my sister in law, and her 8 year old son. The experience was great. It exceeded my expectations especially Disney Sea. Like the one in California, they have Disneyland and then California Adventures. Japan's Disney Sea is the equivalent of California Adventures. The place was great. I loved the different themes such as the Little Mermaid and Aladdin. Of course, the park was very clean. Loved the different kinds of popcorn flavors sold throughout the park and the different sorts of pastries. The park was also very friendly for families with strollers. Most of the rides were child friendly especially for 3 year olds. Overall the experience was great and I wouldn't mind going back again and again maybe when my son gets older. Only note is to make sure you've got spending money especially if you want to bring home souvenirs and do miscellaneous shopping at the park. The only disadvantage if needed be mention is that most of the shows were in Japanese (which is expected being in Japan) but the nice thing is they provided little monitor looking gadgets which provide English subtitles."
2985,5,N/A,Australia,Exceeded my expectations,"I absolutely loved this place! My partner and I are both in our mid-twenties but enjoyed every bit of it. We went on a Thursday in February. It was cold but sunny.We went on most of the attractions and our longest wait was 40 minutes for the Roger Rabbit ride in Toon Town. Most other rides only had a 15-20 minute wait and some, like the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, had no wait at all! A very different experience to my first visit in September 2004 as it was incredibly busy and lines were absurd, 3hour wait time.The park is so clean and there is music everywhere and creates a magical atmosphere. The rides were very impressive, especially the graphics and illusions incorporated into rides like The Haunted Mansion. We stayed until the night time light parade at 6.30pm (we arrived at 11am and walked straight in...no line!) Food and souvenirs were not as pricey as I thought they might be. I had a wonderful time. There were a lot of young adult couples and groups of friends there too...so it is not an experience just for children and families. Highly recommended in winter if you don't mind the cold.  "
2986,2,N/A,N/A,Fast pass farce!,"Disney was great if you love standing in line watching people with fast passes walk past you, and just when you think you are going to get in the queue attendant makes you wait a little longer in case there are any more fast passes.... So you can wait some more"
2987,4,N/A,Malaysia,A nice place for outing with friends and family. . And Disney fans too!,Cinderella's castle was beautiful. . The hall is a must visit. We got to watch both day and night parade.. it was fantastic. Snow White booth.. hmm.. seemed scary because there were just too much of the bad queen. The wild wild west ride was also fun (but a bit creepy for my little daughter).Go there early to avoid long queues to take pics with Disney characters. We purchased the single day entry.. myb not enough to play everything inside disneyland. 
2988,5,13-Jan,United States,Just like in the U.S.,"Tokyo Disneyland is practically identical to the one in California, so if you have been to that one, do not expect anything new here.  The biggest difference is obviously that the characters speak in Japanese in the park and on the rides, although they still sing the songs in their English form.I went on a cold, rainy day in January and had practically no waits in any of the lines.  I have been to Disneyland/DisneyWorld many times, so I was a bit bummed that I wasted a day in a culturally-rich place going to the same park.  However, if you have never been, Disneyland is amazing.The park entrance is directly next to the entrance of DisneySea (in comparison-- AMAZING and 100% worth it), so your party can split up and meet in front of the gates at the end of the day if necessary.  The park is accessible by a train ride from most hotels in Tokyo (I stayed at the Tokyo Hilton and had about a one-hour commute)."
2989,4,12-Nov,Japan,DisneySea & Disneyland - memories of childhood in a new light,"Despite the crowds of Tokyo Disney parks, the experience is always positive. People are courteous and most children are well behaved - quite unlike American Disney parks. From signature food items to cute merchandise, the park doesn't have to work too hard to make you spend your money. Nevertheless, the atmosphere is light hearted and enjoyable. DisneySea is a great one to visit since it is not offered anywhere else in the world -- it's more of a combination of all of Disney World Florida parks."
2990,3,13-Jan,New Zealand,Not that fantastic compared to California's,"I found the one in California to be much more worth it. The queue for the rides were very long as usual. Most of the staffs speak minimal English but they will start explaining everything in Japanese even though you do not understand them. There were not many rides, main ones would be Space Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain and Splash Mountain. The haunted house was not open when we visited. There are also lots of local tourists and very few foreign tourists. You'll have to sit on the floor to watch the parade so many of the local tourists bring their own mats to lay on the floor. We went on a Sunday and saw the 2PM parade, as well as the 7.30PM electrical parade. Fireworks was not very spectacular. The tickets were cheap though. There was student discount if we produced our student cards. Overall, still enjoyable but would not go back again."
2991,5,13-Jan,Singapore,A world of dreams,"Its so wrong to think that Disneyland is only for the children. It is for everyone, from the very young to the seniors. A fairytale land where one can just forget about the world outside and enjoy themselves. There are things just about for anyone. Most of the rides are catered for the family and younger children, so they tend to be mild. Still, there are some more thrilling ones; a personal favourite being the Space Mountain. I had to battle the crowds even when I visited on a weekday. There were tourists and locals swarming the park. Entrance tickets can be purchased online, at the Disney store in Shibuya or at the park entrance itself. The only thing about buying tickets at the park itself? You will have to wait and queue. Food outlets are located all over the park, so are souvenir shops. It would be good to check out when the daily parade takes place. Not sure if there is a fixed timing for it. If so, it is at 2pm on weekdays. This is when the various Disney characters appear in song and dance, going past the waving crowd. Photo-taking with individual characters can also be done.. but it was really tough with the more popular characters. What with so many people vying for their attention! Fireworks are not on every evening. Please check the park calendar and schedule if you are visiting to see the fireworks. Operating hours of the park varies too!! Please check their website.As much as the entrance fee is pricey, Disneyland is worth at least one visit."
2992,4,12-Dec,Japan,Exciting place to get you mind relaxed.,A fun place to visit on weekend. Crowded on most weekends and holidays. So you better buy your ticket in advance.
2993,5,12-Jun,Australia,Disney Summer... A must do!,"I went to the Disney resort over the summer of 2012 and couldn't have had a greater time. It is almost as large as the one in California and just as incredible. Some rides are in Japanese but that doesn't take the thrill away at all. Spectacular shopping, plenty of food choices and an all round amazing time, I did four days but i could have done more if i had more time. Anyone of all ages with a love for disney will be blown away!"
2994,4,13-Jan,United States,Coming of Age Day 2013,"I went to Tokyo Disneyland during a national holiday known as Coming of Age Day. Normally the park is incredibly crowded, but since the weather was unfavorable (it rained and snowed) it was moderately crowded, but it lightened as the day continued. As an American, I relished in the idea of it snowing at a Disney park. It's magical in an entirely new way. That being said, if you visit in Winter, be warned! The day I went, the forecast was rainy and 40 degrees F. It rapidly became a slushy, snowy pile up. Luckily the park sells many ponchos and umbrellas. Weather aside, the park is very enjoyable, even in the rain/snow. It is very spacious compared to it's California counterpart and more modern. The rides are different than in California, but it doesn't have as many of them."
2995,5,12-Jun,Australia,Unique rides - Pooh's Hunny / Honey Hunt a must !,"We have visited a few Disneylands in the past and this one in Tokyo will not disappoint.Out of the most rides below are the ones which I most liked.1. Pooh's Hunny Hunt - not only it is fun and exciting to ride in, you also admire the engineering behind it - how can they make this ride work in a safe and fun manner ? Plan ahead as the queue for this one is very very long ! 2. Space mountain - because I love roller coaster rides.skip ""it's a small world"" unless if you are with Kids."
2996,4,N/A,Australia,Amazing!,"I was so impressed with this theme park. We bought our tickets the day before at the Disney store in Takeshimaya in Shinjuku. We went on a Monday. The lines were not bad at all when we arrived about 10:30am, but they did get longer throughout the day. The park is beautiful with attention to detail, all the themes uniforms and smiling workers.Yes, all the audio for rides and shows is in Japanese, but you get the idea.They had so many cute and special foods, like monsters inc bun, toy store mochi, Mickey Mouse waffles etc etc. we had brought some snacks in from the convenience store at the train station to cut down on spending on the typically overpriced theme park food, but we still had to buy some of these cute things!I couldn't believe how special they had made it for Christmas, decorations outside, and they had even done the special it's a small world and nightmare before Christmas rides!! We didnt get time to do absolutely everything, but almost everything. The fast pass system is great, but gets full by the end of the day, so work out what you want to use it for and get in quick. We did the nightmare before Christmas ride and astroblasters. By the time we came out of that at 4pm, all the other fast passes were already finished.I had previously been to the Hong Kong Disneyland, and that was a fun day, but the Tokyo one is twice as big!! Next time I will go to Tokyo Disney Sea!!  It really is the happiest place on earth! The nighttime electrical parade is awesome also!"
2997,4,13-Jan,Singapore,Fun day out!,"Having never been to Disney anything, we simply had to make a trip to Disneyland. Being an avid fan of Disney cartoons after growing up on a steady diet of Cinderella, Peter Pan and Lion King reruns, it was a most memorable day, and it was really fun to boot. Don't worry about the language problem. I cannot speak Japanese and got along fine. Just be warned that anything that speaks in rides speaks in Japanese. You'll still get the main idea. I am terrified of roller coasters so there is no review of that. Instead, I really enjoyed all the kiddy rides we took. The Peter Pan ride had fantastic animatronics, including a whole lighted-up city. It really felt as though we were flying through the story. My personal favourite is 'It's a Small World'. Since we were there during the New Year's season, it was still running a special Christmas and New Year's display that was really pretty! Also enjoyed cheesy things like a cruise along the river in the big steamer boat, spinning teacups and the carousel. The Pooh's Hunny Hunt ride is also pretty awesome and if you love cutesy things, you have to rush for your Fast pass or queue up for it. Missed out on Monsters Inc and the Buzz Lightyear ride so I guess I'll have to go back for that! Food is pricey so we bought lots of snacks from a convenience store near our accommodation and brought it over though. There were lots of families with little kids around when we visited so it's certainly a place that's great for people of all ages."
2998,5,13-Jan,Australia,Language not an issue,"Tokyo Disneyland is still tons of fun even if you don't speak Japanese.  For one thing, it looks absolutely fantastic - and, in this case, a vista is worth a thousand words! Many of the favourite rides from Disney theme parks elsewhere in the world are here.Our favourites are Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters, Space Mountain, Star Tours, Big Thunder Mountain, Splash Mountain and Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin.  The ""must not miss' event is the electric parade, which is absolutely dazzling.  We also liked the shows  ""One Man's Dream II - the Magic Lives On"" and ""Minnie, Oh Minnie"". You will need at least 2 days to try all the rides and see all the shows and attractions at Tokyo Disneyland.  If you only have 2 days, then spend at least one at Tokyo Disney Sea, and if you only have one day, I would recommend Tokyo Disney Sea.  The shows are way better, the attractions are more sophisticated, the rides are great and the park, overall, is more beautiful.If you don't already have tickets, get to Tokyo Disneyland an hour early, at least. The queues to buy tickets (and to get in) can be bad. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday are the quietest days, but they can still be busy. The ""busy"" days can be  really bad. I went on a busy day once, and I won't do it again.  It's not worth it and it's really frustrating. On less busy days get to shows at least 20 minutes early to get a seat. Use Fastpasses as much as possible.To get to Tokyo Disneyland, get the subway to Maihama Subway station, and then transfer to the Disney Resort Monorail. There are plenty of signs and Disney employees to point the way.One hint is to take something to sit on (like a folded towel, flat cushion or a piece of cardboard). When you're waiting for parades, the evening fireworks show, and even in the queues to enter the theme park, you may be grateful for something to sit on.Always check online before you go, as opening and closing times change.  We've been caught waiting for an extra hour for the gates to open.  Also, if you have your heart set on a particular ride or attraction, check online that it's open.  Currently the ""Haunted Mansion"", Star Tours "" and ""It's a Small World"" are closed. As you buy your ticket remember to get the map AND the day's program off shows in English."
2999,5,13-Jan,Indonesia,"Children paradise, and moms who like to shop","This place seems bigger than the one in Anaheim and there is not a terribly long queue for most rides. We covered almost the entire park on one full day from 10 to 7 and still have enough time to shop some souvenirs. My children also loves the parades and were particularly impressed with the pirates of caribbean rides. I would definitely recommend people to come in the winter as there are less foreign tourists, less queues, and just as many rides you can enjoy as it is in the summer without the overbearing heat. Although it is chilly, it is not too cold at all in winter for this part of Japan anyway."
3000,5,12-Jun,Australia,Amazing Amazing Best theme park experience thus far,"Visited during June 2011. Bit after the tsunami that rocked Japan. My kids were 4 & 5 then. Just started adding review to trip advisior so feel i have to do justice to adding 5 stars to a place that really deserves it.Rides were interesting and interactive. Place was crowded but seriously the imangination and interaction behind the rides were well worth it. My family's personal favourites were Peter Pan, Honey Hunt, Buzz Lightyear, grand circuit race the boat ride on the ""missippi"" ...actually it's hard to find rides i didn't like.The rides were well maintained, customes and staff were TOP NOTCH. The Disneyland staff really take pride in their job ...i love that!! they undertsand what their job is and do it right with pride.I felt like a kid again and my kids...well they were in heaven!!. I sent 2 days there...i think a a minimum to deal with the crowds and long queues...you probably need that much time...if you can afford more do it.The parades were top notch. Most of the visitors when i was there were Japanese...who were welll behaved and well mannered.I was articularly impressed with the staff and level of details with the rides, areas near the attraction which showcased the rides or attractions. It was a talikng point for the kids.I have been to the Osaka Universal Studio and also one in Singapore and Australia.Recently visited Kidzania in Malaysia. This place trumps them all.Amazing amazing amazing place!"
3001,4,12-Dec,Australia,Disneyland,"I visited Disneyland with my two children 21 & 25 in December, 2012.  The day got off to a bad start as we got on the worng queue and had to change after that I couldn't use my credit cards (mastercard & visa) to buy a two day pass as the park as they only take JCB and possibly one China card. I found this amazing for such a tourist attraction - they have a bank inside but this also didn't take mastercard or visa.. We had just enough cash but didn't want to spend the day without much cash so I went out took the monorail 250 yen each way to Ikipiara where they had an ATM to get money out and back on the monorail queue again before I could start the day. At least we had english maps which helped.The park is similar to Anahiem but the excitement level of several of the rides like Pirates of the Carribean has been reduced, e.g only one minor drop. The crowds were large and seemed to get larger as the day wore on. All the parades like other Disneylands were amazing and spectacular although it did seem funny for the talking to be in Japanese but the songs in English. Characters were available for photos and were very friendly.The queue for rides were fairly long but not too bad but none of the professional photographers spoke English.Whilst I loved Dinseyland I don't think it is as good as the original."
3002,4,12-Dec,Australia,More like the traditional Disney,"This park felt more like Disney....apparently we were there at not a particularly busy time, but queues were still long, 70 minutes for the Pooh Honey Hunt which although in Japanese was still lovely.  We saw 3 parades, which I think are always the best. We were disappointed that the stores didn't sell the American stuff....Japanese sweets just aren't as good.  We really did have a great day here, just a little something lost in translation."
3003,4,12-Sep,Singapore,Nice attractions but super-long queue,"We visited Tokyo Disneyland with our young kid. The place was really beautiful, many of the characters were walking around so plenty of photo opportunities with them. The attractions are plenty and interesting. We loved the river safari the most, although our kid seems to fell in love with the 'small-world' rides. Staff were friendly and helpful, and the crowds were very organized too. Queue can be super-long, some attractions had more than an-hour queuing time. Overall, fun and enjoyable experience, worth a try."
3004,5,12-Dec,Australia,Tokyo Disneyland,"We went on the 4th of December - a mildly rainy Tuesday- we never queued any longer than 15 minutes.  We did use the fast passes but most of the time it was quicker just to queue for the ride.  Occasionally we saw rides with wait times up around 45 minutes so we would walk onto another ride and come back.  We rode everything we wanted plus some of them several times, we managed space mountain and splash mountain twice - the latter with a queue of 10 minutes.  I think we must have got really lucky.  We were able to get front row seats for the parades by wandering up 15 minutes before the start time.  I think it might have been the weather forecast that helped us as it was supposed to thunderstorm - but the storms did not eventuate.  When it did rain a little, the staff came out with squeegees and dried all the seats, paths and even the tops of the bins.  Our family of four had a wonderful time and found the food reasonably priced.  Only down side it that my husband only just fit into some of the rides and he is 6 feet 2 inches so people over about 6ft 4 inches would probably not fit on space mountain or splash mountain as my husband had to sort of sit sideways on these.  Thunder mountain was closed for maintenance during our visit. I was really impressed with the general condition of the park and the quality of the rides and none of them were too scary for me who doesn't really enjoy the big thrill rides."
3005,3,12-Dec,Singapore,Fun place but knowing the language would be useful,"Well managed with good service staff. My family visited in winter and the place was packed but we could still get on to the river boat and train without any difficulty. Overall the signposts were clear but it was slightly difficult conversing with the staff who spoke mainly Japanese. The more popular rides involved quite a bit of a wait, some over 30mins long. Staying near or in the resort would be an advantage but not really necessary as it is quite easy to get there using Tokyo''s very extensive rail and bus network."
3006,1,N/A,N/A,Not worth the money because of the staff attitude.,"I have been to Tokyo Disney twice with a visit to Anaheim Disney in between. First complaint is that it is not family friendly at all. I had a child sleeping in a pram and requested for the pram to be placed in the back of the theatre where the handicapped area is. The staff refused and I had to wake my child up, leave the pram outside. I would have been successful if I had my child sleeping in a wheelchair.  In another show, my pram was placed in the front of a sign that displayed the menu for a restaurant. After a show, I was trying to get my child into the pram and I was told by a Disney usher to get out of the way because I was blocking the menu. How long would I take to get my child into the pram that it would affect the business of the restaurant? Next, for some absurd reason, no tripods, monopods or any other small attachments to a camera to prop it up on a flat surface is against Disney (Japan) law.  First I used a monopod while seated at the second row for the parade. My camera was no higher than my head, a Disney usher (more like a Disney police man) caught me like a criminal and told me to keep my monopod as if it was a weapon.  Assuming that the logic of Disney was for me not to block anyone behind me, I located myself with a wall behind more than 20 m from the parade line for the next parade. Another Disney usher came to me and told me that no tripods were allowed in the entire park. What is the logic? I am not filming with a broadcast quality camera to document a film for sale. I just want my home video to be a stable non shaky one.  Finally, I placed my camera on a stone platform facing the giant lake in Disney sea for the night's finale show. Guess what? Again I was told no by the Disney police. I gave up on videoing and I just accepted that this was not a place where the people who paid money would have their dreams come true and have a good time with memories to bring home. Disney Japan is a place for the dreams of Disney to come true to cash in on us paying for below par service and illogical rules. I will never recommend Disney Japan for a long time and I will repeat telling this experience too. Bear in mind that waiting 45 mins and beyond for a ride is already absurd but I am willing to wait for a great ride. Attitude from the staff means quality has been sacrificed for more profit.  Disney Anaheim is a much better place..."
3007,5,12-Jun,United States,Everything is better in Japan!!,"I'm sure that a lot of you know what to expect in a Disney resort, so I'm just going to give some really helpful tips that will make your visit to TDL the best.1: KNOW WHEN TO GO. You want to go when school is in session for most and when it's raining. Yes, Disneyland is VERY fun even when it's raining. June is the best time to go, when we have our ""tsuyu"" season and when most kids are still in school.2: MAKE A PLAN FOR THE DAY. You can really lose a lot of time if you're just wandering around. TDL is pretty big but its organized. Before you head out, make sure you have the map somewhat memorized (like the general locations of each themed place). This really helped me to make the most of my time there.3: DON'T WASTE TIME SHOPPING. I don't exactly know why a lot of people spend a lot of time shopping for goods. Most of the stuff you can just buy at your hotel (it's true; they repeat goods here!)4: BUY THOSE FAST PASSES. The popular rides (Space, Thunder, Splash Mountains) can get really crowded. 5: BRING LUNCH. The food in Disney Sea, I have to admit, is way better than the food served in TDL, unless you want to eat at Blue Bayou. Blue Bayou is the best restaurant offered here but you must make reservations in advance, especially for dinner.6: WEAR SNEAKERS. I've seen a lot of people here running and tripping because they weren't wearing appropriate footwear. Sneakers is the best way to go. Wear them and be prepared to run when you need to.7. LEARN BASIC JAPANESE BEFORE YOU GO. People here don't really speak English very well. If you want to really enjoy your time here, learn a few phrases before you go. ""Where is the bathroom?"" is ""Otearai wa doko desuka?"" If you want to know where a certain ride is, ""*name of the ride* wa doko desuka?"" I can't say everything here so make sure to buy one of those books with simple Japanese phrases.Have fun!"
3008,5,12-Feb,Australia,Great fun - and good food for those with allergies.,"Love it, love it.Heaps of great rides - some of the little kid rides (Peter Pan, mostly) are great for adults too, just for the amazing detail and thought that's gone into each one.No real thrill rides - a major plus in my book!  But lots and lots of fun.  Especially Splash Mountain.  :)Fantastic shows, shops, rides, food.  Light years better than any Australian theme park!Lines can get up to a couple of hours, so get the Fast Pass if it's available - it means you come back at a particular time and get in the Express Queue.FOOD ALLERGIES AND TOKYO DISNEYLAND:I visited most recently in 2012 with my gluten free brother.  It's actually pretty good for food intolerances/allergies.  At the restaurants (the fancier ones, not the takeaway outlets) they will have an allergy free set-meal.  So you'll get a drink, meal item and dessert.  About 1000 yen, so not very expensive, either and won't contain wheat, egg, dairy, nuts... I don't remember what else, but all the major allergies.  One thing - these restaurants tend to close around six I think (the park is open til 10), so get dinner fairly early."
3009,4,12-Jan,United Arab Emirates,Its Huge,"You really can have alot of fun, move around with an old classic style slow motion car. paying additional amount as a premium ticket that you do not have to queue and get an express service, make sure you have Japanese yen as they do not accept forign currency at the cashier in the entrance, there is an exchange agency adjacent but you have to present your passport to be able to exchange money, food and beverage facilities available, botique to be sevoniurs as well, you may spend the whole day and evening there, if you have children they will love it. even you will enjoy it very much as an adult."
3010,4,12-Nov,Malaysia,Enjoyable but hungry,No halal food outlet...We survived on popcorns and churros. Beautiful magical place...too bad most of the explanations are in japanese language...
3011,2,N/A,N/A,Extremely crowded,"Even on a weekday TokyoDisney is a hypercompetitive bunfight. A trifecta of intense fanaticism about all things Disney; Japanese patience/preparedness to queue and parents-behaving-badly-on-account-of-their-kids.Queue times will get up to 100min (200+ on certain rides!) and people will sprint from the gate if it gets them a seat on their favourite ride or push/shove/mob their way to a photo with their favourite Disney character. The epitome of this was a man I witnessed using an occupied pram to push his way into a mob surrounding Pooh and then kept bumping the mascot with it until he got his photo.If you have a particular ride you want to do, come along 1h before opening and bring a mat to sit in the queue. Then, sprint from the gates to your ride when they open. You will not be the only one doing so - trust me."
3012,5,12-Oct,United States,Tokyo Disney Halloween - Cool!,"I stayed at the Sheraton Grande for one night. There is a stop for the Disney monorail directly across the street. It comes every 4 minutes and circles the DisneySea, Metro Station, Disneyland and the hotels. There is a ticket machine at the stop but you need cash.  I could not figure out how to use a credit card with all directions in Japanese.  I lucked out and someone coming off the train saw me struggling and handed me their day monorail pass. At the entrance to the park I bought an evening pass to Tokyo Disneyland around 4pm which let me in at 6pm sharp. I went over to the Disneyland Resort and had a drink in the bar looking out over the park as the sun set. Long lines began forming waiting for the night pass entry at 6, so you need to get in line early. I was concerned they would be sold out on a Friday night but they were still selling tickets at 4. I forgot to reserve the ticket at least a week in advance and was unable to get it online. Advance tickets are available from 2 months to one week before.It was October so the park was dark at 6 but it was a Halloween themed night with jack-o-lanterns everywhere so dark was great.  It was entertaining to hear announcements in Japanese and also in English by the familiar male voice from the other parks at LA and Orlando. Signs were in both English and Japanese. I rode the Haunted Mansion and it was all in Japanese with no English at all. The line was over an hour long so I only had time for one. I did note the tombstones on the way in were in English.  The theme was around Jack from Nightmare before Christmas and it featured Sandy Claus and a Christmas theme, but I had no idea what it was actually about.  There was an impressive electrical parade and fireworks. The center area of Tokyo Disney is much larger than DisneyWorld/Land the paraded circled around it and so there were more places to see the parade. The Halloween fireworks show was substantially shorter and less impressive than the one at Disney World in Orlando. Everything in the park was very familiar and laid out in the same order as the other parks - AdventureLand, FrontierLand, FantasyLand, TomorrowLand.  There was a TuneTown that was much larger than DisneyWorld and more Roger Rabbit oriented. I saw very few non-Japanese in the crowd and everyone was wearing Mickey ears it seemed. I could find no ""I was there"" Tokyo Disney t-shirts anywhere.  Just general Disney themed shirts with Mickey, Donald, etc. It was a really cool experience."
3013,5,12-Oct,Ireland,Best Disneyland in the whole world,I've been in all Disneylands around the world and I can tell this is the best one I've ever been in. It's worth a visit when visiting Tokyo
3014,4,12-Oct,Indonesia,great disney parade,"great disney parade, great firework. i love the atmosphere.the ride are not very special, not thiller maybe more family oriented and you must wait quiet long. use the fast pass but you still can not cover the whole area."
3015,5,12-Apr,Australia,Fantastic,"Had a great day, should have allowed an additional day. Brought back lots of memories. Easy access by train from Tokyo, have a copy of your pass port with you to receive seniors discount if you are over 60."
3016,5,12-Oct,United Arab Emirates,Definitely worth a visit or two,"I was quite disappointed by EuroDisney and did not have high hopes for the one in Tokyo but boy was I wrong! The place is every bit as magical as the original. Clean, organised and brimming with colour. I went on a weekday to beat the queues which are quite long on weekends. The metro drops you off right in front of the park so getting there is a breeze. The parades are entertaining and the floats are beautiful. If you could you MUST visit on Halloween as the guests come in full costume and it is quite a site! They also have a Halloween parade. Entrance fee is not expensive and lasts the whole day. The rides are good sadly some were undergoing maintenance at the time of my visit. The food is diverse and everything I tried was really good. I loved every minute of it and would definitely go again."
3017,5,12-Jan,United States,Must visit place in lifetime,"I have visited the same when I was in Japan. Seriously it is an amazing place to have good fun and adventure. I enjoyed with many rides, shows & food in Disneyland."
3018,3,12-Oct,Canada,Way too many people on a weekday,We visited Disneyland on a Tuesday and there was absolutely too many people in the park. Around lunch time waiting time on lines on the popular rides like splash mountain was already 90 minutes. The Space Mountain ride was like 120 minutes. Winnie the Pooh was about 90 minutes or so.
3019,4,12-Oct,Australia,Interesting combination of old-school and new-school Disney,"I grew up visiting various Disneyworld theme parks in Florida, so as a big kid I just could not resist visiting Tokyo Disneyland with my husband in mid-October 2012 (on a Monday).  I was shocked at how many people were there on a weekday, almost all of them Japanese and far more adults than children.  The Japanese really love Disney (I saw a businessman with a Mickey Mouse keychain on the train one day!).First, the rides.  They still have some of the oldest Disney rides that I think they've removed from most Disney parks, such as It's a Small World, Country Bears Theatre and even Captain EO (1987 Michael Jackson space opera that I thought I'd never see again in my life!).  All of these rides had next to no queue at all, but I loved them for the old-school nostalgia.On the other hand, they also had more recent film rides, such as Monsters Inc, Toy Story, and even a Winnie the Pooh ride I haven't seen elsewhere.  Other classics, such as the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean, were 'updated' - Pirates has inserted Jack Sparrow (who looks creepy because it's a really realistic character next to cartoony animatronic pirates) and the Mansion is now Nightmare Before Christmas themed (again, tacked on top of the old-fashioned ghosts, it seems very odd to me).It was a bit difficult to anticipate which rides the Japanese adore and which they ignore.  Almost the queues were 60-90 minutes within an hour or two of opening and you only get a chance to use your fast pass 2 or 3 times before that sells out too.  We ended up only going to 2 or 3 of the big-name rides because we didn't have the energy to wait in line after about lunchtime.  Even the smaller rides like Peter Pan and Snow White had 45-60 minute queues in the afternoon.The big surprise for us was Pirates of the Caribbean - 20 minute wait in the middle of the day!  The Beaver Brothers canoe ride was kind of fun too with only a 10 minute wait, although the guide only spoke Japanese he started up a chant of ""ichi - ni, one - two"" for our sake.Other considerations: Most rides are translated into Japanese, which doesn't really matter since you get the idea regardless (Captain EO just used subtitles, it was in English).  We didn't find the queues for food were bad, except the popcorn carts early in the day.  Apparently the Japanese adore flavoured popcorn, so instead of waiting for soy sauce or curry popcorn just buy another snack!The parade is quite fun and a good break, just wait until about 20 minutes beforehand and sit yourself down for a nice rest.Finally, we forgot to buy our ticket beforehand but it didn't matter.  We got there right on opening time and the queue was to enter the park - there was no queue to buy the ticket first.Final verdict?  If you love Disneyland, you will love Tokyo Disney - it's like American Disney but even cleaner, more polite and with fewer obnoxious visitors.  But be aware that unless you get really lucky you will not get to ride everything you want.  If you accept this from the start you can have a really magical visit."
3020,5,12-Jul,United States,Must do for Disney fan!,If you love Disney you will love Tokyo Disneyland. The park has attractions for all ages and to interest everyone. The park has incredible theming with no detail spared. Everything down to the shape of food. I would describe this as Walt Disney World 1997 as far as the quality of the Disney Experience goes. It is important to note that this being Japan the characters and shows are in Japanese. Some attractions have English support. The staff also speak Japanese although English is available on menus and some staff members also can assist in English.
3021,5,11-Nov,Japan,Dreamy,"Its all about details. Disney is perfect in its details, but adults better not expect too much from t rides/attractions. Not t place for adventure this I can assure u!! I actually visited the park before november, but t date was not available."
3022,5,12-Jun,Malaysia,The happiest place on earth,"I spent most of my day in Disneyland walking around, taking photos, and watching the various parades and shows. The parades are a joy to watch, particularly if you're a Disney fan. They're bright and colourful and enjoyable. The dancers in the parades look like they're enjoying themselves and they enjoy interacting with the audience as well - kids receive special attention, of course.The trick to getting a good viewing spot for the parades is to just show up early and grab your seat. You can sit down just about anywhere along the parade route, but they don't allow you to take out your folding chairs or mats and stuff until half an hour to showtime. I caught the Easter Wonderland Parade, the Jubilation! Parade, and the Electrical Parade. For Jubilation! I got there about an hour before the show began and got myself a prime spot. (It was really hot, but I persevered, knowing that if I got up and walked away, someone else would be sitting there when I came back.) I went to look for a place to sit down more than an hour before the Electrical Parade in the evening, but many of the best spots were taken already! Disneyland was almost ridiculously crowded, which meant that rides were rather out of the question for me since I had no intention of standing 2-3 hours in line for a ride, though there were some I badly wanted to try. I was also on my own there, so an overly long queue would have been no fun at all.That said, I did manage to hop on the Big Thunder Mountain roller coaster in the night, right after the Electrical Parade. I had a wait time of 40 minutes for that, which was bearable in comparison to the 3-hour wait time specified for Splash Mountain in the morning. Big Thunder Mountain was lots of fun! Given that Space Mountain was closed at the time, I think I made the right choice in picking Big Thunder Mountain then. Disneyland is totally worth a visit if you have the time for it and if you love Disney."
3023,4,12-Sep,Japan,Magical!,I didnt enjoy much because the rides are quite simple but my kids really do. they love the parades and the castle.
3024,4,12-Oct,Taiwan,The kids loved it and we loved it too!,"It is sooooo much better than Disneyland in LA or HongKong!but way to much people. We were there on a weekday and still, it took about 30-40min wait for each ride!But We shall go again if we r in Tokyo!"
3025,5,12-Mar,Japan,Great fun,"In the summer time, it's crazy busy, long lines. When I went in November and march, next to no lines - less than 15 min, for anything. I didn't mind going on a slightly drizzly day. :)   Loved everything, definitely a ""light"" version of the one in California."
3026,3,12-Oct,Australia,Lots of enthusiasm,"But way too busy, lines for everything even to eat, take photos or find somewhere to sit down. Most rides had a 2 hour wait time and had no fast pass system operating.But if you're not interested to do any rides, it is great. Lots of attention to detail in the decorations and enthusiasm for theatrics that only the Japanese could pull off."
3027,5,12-Oct,Italy,Disney fun - Tokyo style,"Visiting Tokyo Disney Land is a really fun way to spend a day! The park is beautifully decorated and it is really fun to take in all the sights and the people dressing up in the Disney character costumes and hats. There are some classic Disney rides like Space Mountain, Splash Mountain and Pirates of the Caribbean, but because the dialogue on the rides are in Japanese, even familiar rides will feel new! It‚Äôs still easy to follow the plot even I you don‚Äôt understand Japanese ‚Äì hearing all the songs and familiar characters in Japanese is actually quite entertaining! You can get translator devices at some of the shows ‚Äì just ask the attendants at the entrance. As always, you can expect long queues at all the popular rides, so make use of the Fast Pass system if you can. I managed to get three Fast Passes and they were very useful!There is a wide selection of food and snacks (both Eastern and Western), so you'll definitely find something that suits your taste. The selection of different popcorn flavours was really amazing - I tried the Caramel flavour as well as the Curry flavour... both were really delicious.Be sure to get there at least one hour before the park opens - the Japanese believe in arriving early, so you can expect long queues if you get there late. There are ATM's inside the park, but they only take Japanese and Chinese bank cards, so if you do not have one of these, be sure to bring plenty of cash with you. There is a small bank with a cashier desk where you can charge cash to your credit card, but to do this, you need to give them some kind of identification.Also be sure to wear comfortable shoes - the park is quite large and the best rides are spread all over the park, so you'll do a lot of walking. I wouldn't recommend going on a very hot day - it will definitely not be pleasant walking around the park in the height of summer! Also, most of the park is not under cover, so it will be very unpleasant if it is raining."
3028,3,12-Sep,Australia,Over it,"Ugh.. too many people, lines are way too long. Food/Drinks are reasonably priced Lots of crying young children and if you don't have a fast pass there seems to be no point in lining up, as you will be there for hours! otherwise, great decorations for halloween and nicely laid out park. The only problem is actually getting on a ride.."
3029,3,11-Oct,Japan,Extremely Long Waiting Time,"Don't expect your child to get on more than 5 rides during an entire day.  We read online that it was best to get there just after midnight to ensure a parking spot as well as an early entry.  We did just that and was amazed at the long line of cars that formed up to 6 hours prior to the open.  The park allows an overwhelming number of people to fill the park.  Would like to buy your child popcorn?  Get in line and wait at leas 30 minutes.  Depending on the location within the park you may also need to get in line to get in the restrooms, especially girls.At the end of the day it will be the waiting in line that will fill your memory of the day."
3030,4,12-Aug,Indonesia,will be come back again....,"my children like it very much.... I think if the park open 24 hours, they will be stayed along.... we definitely come again next time visit"
3031,2,12-Sep,Australia,Tokyo Disneyland,"If you've been to Disneyland in the USA, don't bother with this one. All the same rides, but wait times are up to 3 hours on the popular rides. You can get a fast-pass on some rides, but 1 hour after they opened, most fast-pass times were taken and you can't book another pass until after you have used a booked one. Food pretty basic theme park low quality/high priced, when will these places learn to give us good food, at non rip off prices. This place put me off ever visiting another Disneyland. Very close to train station."
3032,4,12-Sep,Australia,Great Disney Park,"This is the only Disneyland I have been to.  We had a fantastic day there, then went back to our hotel to freshen up to do it all again that evening.  The park was very clean ad everything operated well, however be warned there are large crowds and long queus."
3033,4,12-Sep,Japan,Immaculate!,"Been to Disneyland in California, Paris and now Tokyo.  Without a doubt, Disneyland Tokyo is the most authentic.  Recall thinking Disneyland Paris was a bit shabby with chipping paint and some of the mechanical characters not working correctly in some of the rides.  Nothing like that here in Tokyo.  Everything is in good working order, grounds are beautiful, and every detail is perfect.  Everyone smiles and is so polite like no place but Japan!Negatives...The Japanese queue like no other nation.  2, 3, even 4 hours doesn't seem to phase them.  Rain comes, umbrellas come out, raincoats go on, no one seems to go home, and they just endure with a smile.Tip - Use ""Fast Pass"" judiciously.  Ran with my son to Space Mountain, got fast pass and got in line.  One of the first ones here so got on the ride in about 20 minutes.  Ran over to Big Thunder Mountain, got Fast Pass then waited for 45 minutes in the normal line (Still early in the morning!). Then ran back over to Space Mountain to get on with Fast Pass (5 minute wait), then ran to Splash Mountain, got a Fast Pass ticket and over to Big Thunder Mountain for our second ride.  Thing is, after you get a fast pass you have a period of time before you can use it again.  Each ride only has so many Fast Pass reservation times and once they get to park closing times, the Fast Pass is shut off for that ride.  If you use it right on time, you might get 5 or 6 Fast Passes through the day and you really don't even have to wait for the ride with Fast Pass - 5 10 min max.  My son figured this all out from going with a friend before and I will tell you, saves you tons of time waiting in lines."
3034,5,12-Sep,Malaysia,Fun place on Earth,"I will rate this after Disney World. I suggest to stay at the Disney partner hotel which is cheaper compare to the disney hotel. It will be very convenient travelling to disney compare staying outside of disney. You can also buy the ticket at these hotels which will prevent long queue at the ticket counter. The staff at disney is extremely helpful and they can speak good english. Be prepare to have fun like a kid there. The place is clean and the price for food are reasonable. The only down side is the characters like Goofy and others. They have a special place for Mickey and some others only. Characters like Goofy and others are on the road. They will not take photo with kids unlike Disney World. Also, most of the 3D movies are in Japanese. The rides recommended at disneysea are Toy story mania and tower of terror (for adults). Recommend to have 2 full days; 1 day at disneyland and the other day ay disneysea. But if given an opportunity to choose, go for the disneyworld in orlando which I think is 10 times bigger with more attraction, rides and park is more visitor friendly."
3035,5,12-May,Singapore,The Happiest Place on Earth,"Having been to the Disneyland in Hong Kong,I must say the Tokyo Disneyland is definitely worth going. In fact, skip the one in Hong Kong, it's way too small and the entrance fee is about the same anyway!!We bought the 2-day pass, for Disneyland & Disneysea.. well worth I feel.The ride in Disneyland is more for kids,while the ones at Disneysea are more excitingI love the night parades, they showcased floats with lights and it was so beautiful.The park is very very clean, beautiful and even though there was a huge crowd at the park, mostly Japanese, everyone were polite and queued up for the rides.They are also very orderly when waiting for parades to start.Language is not a problem since you can rely on the park's map to get around though performances are in Japanese language.However, I don't know why closing fireworks were cancelled that night. We couldn't understand the announcement. The only disappointment.Also note that you can RE-ENTER the park on the SAME day with your ticket.. something we didn't know!You'll definitely have to spend more than half a day at both Disneyland and Disneysea!"
3036,5,12-Sep,Pakistan,Memorable Trip To Tokyo Disney Land,"We visited Tokyo Disney Land in September 2012. One day ticket for an adult costs 6200 yen for all the attractions in the Land. The flowers and trees have been beautifully planted and arranged to add beauty to the buildings and at a number of places Japanese topiary attracts one's attention. To maximize one's fun out of different rides one should get fast passes. By getting a fast pass we get a time allotted to use the ride without getting in long ques. When fast pass for one attraction is issued, fast pass for next attraction will be issued after the time starts for the first attraction. All attractions and rides are fun. I loved Adventure Park the most with its Critters Island Get Wet ride. Tokyo Disney Land and Disney Sea both are a must see. They are too much fun and scenic beauty. The parades in the day and the electrical parade and fireworks at night are spectacular. To visit Tokyo Disney Sea you need another ticket."
3037,5,12-Apr,United States,It's Disney!,"Yep - it's Disneyland!  It feels, in many ways, as if it were lifted right out of California.  The castle feels too small - like CA - but they've widened the streets.  Be prepared for the Japanese queuing, however... they had to make a rule that you can't line up to watch a parade until at least 2 (or was it 3?) hours before it starts.  Just keep your eyes open not to trip on people on plastic traps seemingly in the middle of the street. :)"
3038,5,N/A,Japan,spectacular,"I visited disney  in Florida 3 times but Toyo Disney did it for me.the park is just beautiful, the colors, the arrangement , merchandise. It was breath taking. felt like you were in another world"
3039,4,12-Sep,South Korea,Became kids.... Once Again,"This park is always full of people. Rain or Dry. Lines are always long but If you are strategic enough to plan your rides and shows using your fast pass then it should be okay. We queued for 1.5 hours for only 1 attraction per day and  the rest are using past pass n single rider. YES! they do have single rider,but only for 1-2 attractions. However, they told me that no single rider on one of the day that we went there(Saturday). Since we have 1 year old, we have to use the switch system for the rides that babies were not allowed. Told the staff that were were going to switch, then they would gave you 1 pc of paper. 1 person queued for the ride and 1 person took care of my daughter. Once the person were done with the ride then the other person switched to go for the ride using the paper that the staff gave earlier then he/she will be allowed to go in to the fast pass lane. So, no more queueing for the 2nd person.They are using the lottery system for the entrance to 1 of the show(One Man's Dream). You can only try your luck once a day. We didn't win the lottery for both days that we went to Disneyland, so bummer on that. Japanese people are very systematic . Everybody were asked to sit down during the parade, so everybody could see it. We were even told to fold the stroller and laid it down on the floor. Overall, we really enjoyed it."
3040,3,N/A,Indonesia,Queue land,"We arrived at 8.15 in Disneyland..and wow.. thousands of people already waited outside of the park...althought it's not weekend,and very hot..maybe it's summer holiday..I thought..the situation was not fun again,cause you must queue and queue..and so many people walk there..The attraction was similar with  Disneyland..in Hongkong ..but it's only bigger...so when we saw the queue..we chose to find the other attractions..or just take a photo.. It's really queue land.."
3041,5,11-Nov,Australia,The Best Day In Japan - however lines were a little long,i love disneyland no matter where it is and tokyo is no exception!!! we had a ball!!! the admission and shops were great and reaosnably priced and the food was very affordable. the had many shows on during the day and at night which was lovely. the only disapointment was the lines - most rides were over 1.5 hours (and this was on a weekday) so i dont even think we went on a ride - however you could purchase a fast pass. it really close to narita airport so if yu have a long wait i suggest you come here to kill time. the train from shinjuku was about an hour all up which was a bit painful and the train line for disney is ages away from the other platforms so with kids i suggest a stroller and comfy shoes but lets be realistic its not like they have the space in tokyo to set up a theme park in the city. all in all I had a super day and would recommend to all :)
3042,4,11-Nov,India,Great fun,"Its a must visit in tokyo.Especially for children ofcourse. But the waiting time is a killer. We were forced to skip a few rides because of the waiting time.I loved the goodies though,brought back lots for the kids back home.Do not miss the after dark parade. It was the best part."
3043,2,N/A,Australia,Disappointing and unorganized.,Access to the park was in an orderly fashion and the numbers at the park did not seem that high initially however the wait on some rides was at least 2 hours and some resturants at luch time you had to wait 30 to 40 minutes for service. I would not recommend Tokyo Disney to anyone.
3044,2,12-Aug,New Zealand,Disappointing - Numbers should be Limited!,"Having been to Disneyland Anaheim and having the absolute time of our lives - we were really looking forward to Disneyland Tokyo while in this area. Unfortunatly the experience was not a fun one. I really believe that they should Limit the Numbers they let into the park...It was so crowded you could barely move! We managed to get  a couple of rides when we arrived not long after opening time that had a 40 minute wait but that was it!!....the park became busier, the waiting time for rides increased to 2 hours very early on and the heat was very extreme so waiting this long was not an option for us...  the fast pass machines were closed around lunch. All in all it was a waste of a day and a huge waste of money for our family of six."
3045,5,11-Sep,Indonesia,Make sure you come here if you went to Tokyo,"It has huge attraction that you wouldn't want to skip. Please make sure you come earliest you can or you cannot try them all. I went there on peak season (summer), I arrive at 10AM and I need to queuing for almost 2 hours. And I can only ride 2 attraction because of very long queue. I love the attraction at 6 PM in the middle of the lake. There are Mickey and others characters dancing on top of the ship.Tips:1. You gonna thirsty so make sure you bring you mineral water.2. There are a lot of locker, so don't worry if you bring some stuff.3. Make sure you come earliest you can if you don't want spend your time in queuing.4. There are a 'fast track' that you don't need to queue, but make sure you come earlier to get the 'fast track'"
3046,4,12-Aug,N/A,Tokyo Disney - It's Disney.,"Having been to Disneyland and Disney World, I was not particularly impressed with Toyko Disney. Not that Tokyo Disney is lacking in anyway, but I found it to be more of the same - not anything different.  For me, the best thing was the night-time parade with characters depicted in lighted floats.  Family members traveling with me were dismayed that it was difficult to find anything in the Disney gift shops that said ""Tokyo Disney"".  Almost everything just said ""Disney""."
3047,2,12-Aug,United Kingdom,Summer and Disneyland Don't Mix,We would not recommend Disneyland during Japanese summer school holidays. Its too hot and the attractions still have very long queues. If possible go in September as when the schools starts you will get more out of it and the hot weather does not bother as much when you do not spend the days in the queue.
3048,1,12-Aug,Belgium,Disneyland Tokyo - stay away in peak season,Two of the major attraction were closed for renovation. Another two had to close temporarily today due to some urgent repair. The fastspeed system broke down around lunchtime. And the lines grew by the hour. It took almost three hours to get a ride in the waterattraction.The themepark is nice but was so crowded with people that rushhour in the subway was a pleasure in comparison. Stay away from Disneyland Tokyo in August.
3049,5,12-Jun,Namibia,My third time here and I'm still loving it!,"It was my third time back at Tokyo Disneyland but I still enjoyed myself tremendously. Although it may not be as huge as the Disneyland theme park in LA, it is one which prides itself on excellent service! The whole theme park was very well maintained as well. I loved how orderly everything was. I'll not hesitate to visit the theme park a fourth or even, a fifth time!"
3050,5,12-Mar,Australia,Great Version of the original,"Very functional, clean and well serviced park. The attractions were all open despite low visitor numbers on the day and that was appreciated."
3051,1,N/A,Spain,Waste of money,"Don't waste your money, I was unable to ride on anything with more than 2 hours of queue in any attraction, I've been in three disneys around the world and this is the worse with difference, too many people, queues of one hour to lunch... All the fastpass exhausted in the first hour, I've never seen so many sad childrens like in this park"
3052,5,12-Aug,Japan,"World class, always will be.","Living in Japan for the past 20 years, I've visited Tokyo Disneyland numerous times, especially in the '90s, when my three boys were just kids.  Prior to my visit this week, it was about 10 years since I last visited Tokyo Disneyland and I still see all the magic and excitement in their famous rides, shows, every employee, and the little children that visit.  Granted, I been to Disneyland in Anaheim several times and Disney World in Orlando, and the attractions are basically the same.  But, it is a little different in Tokyo as the park reaches out to the Japanese public.  ."
3053,5,11-Aug,United States,Day full of fun,"Had an amazing time when we visited Tokyo Disneyland in 2008.  Have not yet been back as it can be a bit time consuming by train from where I'm at and a bit expensive, but I'd love to go back.I compare Tokyo Disneyland to the fun I had in Disney World while growing up.  Just amazingly fun, but this time as an adult with my husband.  Even have the castle, which is a staple I grew up on.  (Which I recently found out, to my trip to Disneyland in California, they only have a tiny castle.)This particular park does have it's own Japanese atmosphere, but it's still an amazing place, and you see so many young folks and families come here for fun.  It's got two parks.  Disneyland itself and Disney Sea.  Disney Sea, while it may have one or two rides I can recall for kids, seems to be more adult oriented.  Disney Sea is what has things like Tower of Terror and all.  Each is worth a visit on a separate day for maximum fun.There might be some slight altercations to things to fit in with the culture.  I know with the Tower of Terror is Disney Sea, it incorporates Stitch (from Lilo and Stitch) into the story before you ride on it.  That is something I do not remember being in the US version.  (Assuming it's not changed, which I do not believe it has.)Loads of fun as always at Disney."
3054,4,12-Apr,Australia,Good fun and Cute,"As expected from the Japanese, the park and equipments were clean, well-maintained and efficiently run.  Shows were good and we saw many of them although we would have seen more if we got our hands on the show program timetable earlier.  There was none at the entrance where we got our park map.  We only found out that there's show timetable in the afternoon from a staff on the park street.Many shows were in Japanese but were presented in very uplifting spirits that you also felt the vibe.  Most staff had limited English when the questions get a bit more complicated.  My kid lost our camcorder in the 4D (or 5D, 6D whatever) cinema and the staff wouldn't let us look for it when the show finished due to other session starting.  We waited outside the cinema and the staff found it for us about 15 minutes later.Food were more expensive than outside but not at killing prices.  We had fast food but found the serving size very small (small hamburgers, etc.).  Since this was the only time we had fast food in Japan so not sure if this is common seving size or just because it's in DNL.All in all, it was good fun!  Fireworks was a bit disappointing.  Expected something more spectacular.  However, night parade and lighting were nice, particularly the Cinderella castle.  Lighting on some streets (inside DNL) were inadequate.  It was really dark some streets near the Cinderella castle.  Some dim lights would help pedestrians while not too bright for the lit up castle."
3055,5,12-Jul,New Zealand,A wonderful day in the Happiest Place on Earth!,"We took our 7 year-old son and he was blown away.  The look of delight on his face will stay with me forever.  It's almost identical to the US Disneylands and has all the old favorites - with a Japanese twist.   We noticed the restaurants are better (Queen of Hearts Restaurant in Fantasyland is a great  family spot.).  A new ride we loved was Monsters Inc, and Pirates was just as good as ever, in fact better because they have added Captain Jack Sparrow mannequins.   Splash Mountain reduced our son to tears, but he has since been showing off about doing it! It's all great fun and there's something for everyone.  We missed the crowds by going midweek and NOT during the Japanese school holidays and we were not interested in rollacoasters so that saved us from long lines!     "
3056,5,11-Dec,Japan,"Special, Japanese atmosphere",It's nice to see so many adults without kids enjoying the park. This is one thing I love about Japan
3057,4,12-Jul,United States,after 5 rates are half price,Disney is Disney the best in entertainment industry.
3058,4,11-Oct,Australia,"Great, but very busy!","We went in October and did a 2 day pass with disneysea. I preferred Disneysea as it was slightly less crowded and there were new things for me, as I have been to 4 other Disney places around the world.Loved it but get in quick! It's very busy!"
3059,5,12-Jul,United States,Great family fun!!,"Winnie the Pooh honey pot ride a must!!!! So much fun.Star tours was closed to update like Disneyland Anaheim, so this will be great once it re-opens.Philharmagic 3D attraction is them same as WDW but in Japanese and still worth seeing."
3060,4,12-Jul,Australia,It is a carbon copy of Disneyland Anaheim.,"If you have been to Disney in California, then you will not find this better.  Of course, everyone was so very helpful because it is Disney and the Japanese helpfulness is almost over the top.  The Japanese make full use of the fastpass system, so make sure you get into it as well , straigh away as you can find that getting a fastpass in the morning can have you waiting for a few hours.  Without fastpass, some of the big attractions take a long time as the fastpass line fills up."
3061,4,12-Jul,Indonesia,Use the fast pass,"We like Splash mountain, Haunted MansionWe dislike the lack of food variety.   "
3062,3,N/A,Japan,Way too crowded,The Japanese are crazy about Disney. If you don't mind waiting 2 hours for every ride you'll have a good time.
3063,4,12-Jun,United States,Fun day at Disney,"We had a great day at Disney Tokyo with a 5 and 3 year old.  Many of the attractions are the same as US Disneyland/Disneyworld, but in Japanese.  The kids didn't seem to have a problem with  rides like ""It's a Small World"" in Japanese, instead of English, and either did we.  Food and drinks were good and the park exceptionally clean.  It was a fun day and easy to get to with the Japanese train system.  After the day at Disney Tokyo, we went to Disney Sea.  Not nearly as crowded at Disney Tokyo (never more than a 20 minute wait for rides/attractions and mostly no wait at all).  The kids had an even better time at this park, mostly because of the small waiting times.  The staff is exceptionally helpful and friendly in both parks, even if English isn't spoken they go out of their way to help.  Very fun and memorable time."
3064,5,12-May,China,Excellent trip--great for young kids!,We loved our visit to Tokyo Disney.  We went late May and the crowds were very manageable as it was the off season.    Longest waiting time was 45 minutes for us.   Pooh's Honey Hunt is not to be missed!  it is simply amazing.  What amazed us the most was the cleanliness of the park as well as how well they catered to their youngest audience.   I have 2 toddlers (boys) and every bathroom had toddler size sink and also toilets. Even the women's restrooms each had a little urinal for the boys.   All the different popcorn is worth a try!  Loved the soy sauce and butter flavor =)  We are a big Disney family and we really enjoyed this trip.   The only complaint of any would be that Japan is simply a very expensive place to travel.    We would love to do it again if we can afford it!
3065,5,12-Jun,United States,Another great Magic Kingdom!,"We were pleasantly surprised with Tokyo Disneyland.  We'd visit Tokyo again - JUST to visit Disneyland!The lines were all relatively 'ok'.  A couple rides were bad - Buzz Lightyear, Splash Mountain, the Monsters Inc., Big Thunder Mountain.  But otherwise, not bad.  But really, everything was fine and we expect lines at any theme park.  I didn't think it was so horribley crowded as to make for a bad visit.  Most of the classic rides are in good form - except for Space Mountain which is closed for renovation.  Star Tours is also closed.. a bummer.  I loved Cinderella's Castle.  The Easter Egg hunt going on is fun and it's entertaining to see the characters hidden around the park.Dining options and fees were standard. All the staff were great and very hepful.  English announcements were common.We'd go again - and have a great time!"
3066,5,11-Dec,Indonesia,Good for kids,"i came here on 25th of December, when the place is flooded with people and the density of the place is at ineit's peak. the queue per ride was 2 hrs. it's unavoidable since i chose the worst date in the calendar to visit. nevertheless the place is awesome. As expected in all around Japan, if u do not have any knowledge of the local language you will struggle a bit here.My only advise is do not dine here, everything is so expensive. but everything else is fine. It's best if you come as early as possible so u can enjoy every ride."
3067,4,12-Jun,Japan,Fuel your inner-child!,"I was expecting 2 hour lines and a generally terrible time as this is all I remembered from the last time I went to Tokyo Disneyland more than 13 years ago.  I went with a large group of 9 on a Wednesday when a typhoon was on its way. The uncertain weather forecast must have scared a lot of folks away because the longest we waited for 20 minutes for the Hunny Hunt. I would highly recommend fast-passing Splash Mountain as the line for this attraction is ALWAYS long. There isn't much for vegetarians but if you can handle lots of popcorn and some dairy, you will survive (as I did). The food options were a little lacking but the prices weren't as exorbitant as I'd expected things to be. Most rides were child-friendly and all rides are at least 'big kid' friendly (you have to be at least 110cm to do the 'big kid' rides).If you have time, I would highly recommend the electrical parade. There is just something whimsical and magical about the floats, the dancers, and of course, that irritating electrical parade tune. Watching the bright lights and all definitely fueled the inner-child in me, it was great. The fire works show however, was pretty lame and not really worth watching...In a nutshell, the Tokyo Disneyland experience will greatly vary depending on the day and weather conditions but if you get that combination just right, Disneyland really just might be the happiest place on earth."
3068,2,N/A,Singapore,A weekday badly spent!,"I read multiple reviews of this place and decided to go there on a Friday, first day of my vacation in Japan and it was a terrible mistake. It appeared whole of Tokyo was in there. The waiting time was from 45 minutes to 110 minutes and I must say it was ridiculous. The two kids appeared okay but far from the enjoyment the had at the Universal Studios Singapore or the Hong Kong Disneyland. Stay away from this place Monday through Sunday!!!"
3069,4,12-Jun,Malaysia,Transported back to childhood,"We went on a Tuesday and it was packed. It was a cool and overcast day, so it wasn't too tiring. A day is definitely not enough! When the gates opened at 9am, we didn't understand why everyone started running in.  It was like a huge race! We then realised that the crowd was headed for the respective fastpass booths! Fastpass tickets can be obtained at 2 hour intervals.  Queues were on average about 15-20 minutes, so it wasn't too bad I suppose.  The food and beverage selection definitely needs to be worked on.  Lack of healthy / delicious meals. What we saw was food fast food style! Loved the Easter parade and whatever rides we could get on.  Kids especially loved the car race track and went on it 4 times!Given a chance, I'd definitely go again and this time, buy a 4 day pass!"
3070,5,12-Jun,Australia,As good as the original,"As a big Disneyland fan I was looking forward to this part of the trip, and I wasn't disappointed.  We got a 4 day pass with our accommodation, and the first two days (a Thursday and a Friday) were wet.  This was great, as most of the rides only had a 10-15 minute wait time!  We went on Sunday which was a beautiful day, and it was way too crowded (2 hour wait times on most rides by 9:15am).  We ended up leaving.  We had a positive experience on the quieter days, and I would definitely recommend traveling in the off season (we went in June) on a weekday.  You get to see everything at the park in good time."
3071,5,N/A,Singapore,Tiring but enjoyable day at Disneyland,"When we told our hotel staff that we were going to Disneyland, she told us to go as early as 7-8am. We reached Disneyland at 9am and the queue was so, so long. But once inside, you will be thrilled to try all the rides but again, be prepared for the long queue. We were there until 3pm when we checked in to our Disneyland Hotel just opposite Disneyland. We rested for a while and went back to Disneyland till it closed for the day. The crowd was much much lesser at night and we could enjoy all the rides we couldn't take during the day! "
3072,5,12-Apr,United States,A Park All Its Own,"I owed my niece her High School Graduation present and taking her with me to Tokyo was it.It is recommended to anyone planning to attend either park at the Tokyo Disney Resort to visit the official site to make your reservations way ahead of time. This will guarantee your admission to the park even if the park is at capacity and they stop selling tickets. Getting your tickets at the resort is very easy. Just head to the lower lever of the Ikspiari Mall (Their Downtown Disney), and show them your reservation confirmation printout. Took us less than 5 minutes to be on our way.From the moment you step through the main gate, you can noticed the difference in quality on everything around you. World Bazzar (Main Street) might look small from your first glance, but it is actually big and has a huge glass roof covering the area in case of rain or snow, which is very nice to have.There are a lot of attractions here that, if you've been to the parks in the States, are very similar. There are, however, some with enough differences to make it worth getting in line for. Space Mountain has, from the outside, a retro 70's feel to it since this one still has the escalator to the second level just like the one at Disneyland used to have. The inside, has been completely re-done and, in my opinion, has the best show theme out of the 3 Space Mountains I've been on.If you are not a fan of attractions aimed for children, I would suggest to make an exception for Pooh's Honey Hunt in Fantasyland. It is nothing at all like its counterparts in the U.S. parks at all. It is completely its own experience implementing some of the best technology that I've seen on any attraction. It will have you feeling like you are 5 years old again.Food choices are plenty and everywhere you go on this park. We ate at the Queen of Hearts Dining Hall and the quality of the food was superb. It was just and overall great eating experience, from the greeting at the door to our farewell. Plenty of snacks around the park at a moderate price. Yes, things here were not as expensive as some people make them out to look.We were there on the day of a pretty big storm. The biggest to hit Tokyo since 1959. So the park was empty most from around 3 pm and on and we got to enjoy the park even with the wind and rain. I recommend staying at a hotel withing a moderate distance to the resort in case you get bad weather and they stop the trains. We were able to take a cab for a reasonable price back to our hotel that night after the train service was suspended due to high winds.If you get done with the park at a good time, I recommend taking a stroll at the Ikspiari Mall. There are a lot of good shops for shopping and really good restaurants to eat at catered to all budgets."
3073,5,12-Jun,Australia,a fantasy land to turn an adult into the biggest kid,"I loved this place!  cute characters everywhere, Minnie Mouse's house, fun rides like splash mountain and Pooh's Hunny hunt, the electric parade.  There was so much food to try but it all seemed very american - turkey legs, pizza, churros, popcorn etc.  I went on a friday which meant it was only slightly quieter than say a saturday or sunday but it was still extremely crowded, and I often had to wait around 2 hours or so just to go on a ride.  The crowds also prevented us from having a seat out of the sun to rest our tired legs and eat some lunch.  By closing time we hadn't managed to see everything and the gift shops were so crowded the air became thin and i felt quite ill.  Perhaps a quieter time of year and day of the week would be better.  but overall, still a fun, magical place."
3074,5,N/A,Australia,Everything you would expect from Disney,My friends and I went to Tokyo Dianeyland at the end of May 2012 and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We were a group of 6 adults and made the most of our Disney trip. Disneyland is a short half an hour trip away from Shinkjuku where we stayed we used our PASMO cards to get there without any hassle. The rides are more catered to children so I would suggest visiting Tokyo Disney sea for some more adult rides. Good if you have never been to Disney before.
3075,4,12-May,Malaysia,Another world with long long queues,"Everytime I visit Disneyland, it felt like I'm transported to another world! We really enjoyed ourselves and our only complaint was the long long queues! And we did not even go on a weekend!Even with the Fastpasses, the queues were still long! And because of the long long queues, we could not enjoy all the attractions.There were some rides which were closed: Space Mountain, Mark twain Riverboat, Tom Sawyer Island Rafts so we were quite disappointed.The parades were lovely, as usual. Here, they have curry popcorn. A must-try! And, they also have the delicious turkey legs."
3076,5,12-May,Australia,Fantastic Day + Fastpass explained!,"We (couple, mid 20s) went here on a Thursday in May. It wasn't school holidays, the weather was overcast, warm, a chance of rain. We did our research and had decided beforehand it was going to be Wed or Thursday or never... I'm sure you've all read the warnings about crowds on Friday, Saturday and Sundays! The day before, we went to Shibuya and bought tickets from the Disney Store. It was relatively easy to find and meant we didn't have to line up at Disneyland the next morning (well, to buy tickets anyway).We caught the subway/train out to Disneyland, which was relatively easy. As we were changing trains we saw a lot of school children in groups at the station - a sign of how many people were going to be there! Anyway, no hassles on the train and we arrived out at Disneyland at 8am (an hour early). The opening hours vary day to day so check before hand - we checked at the Disney Store in Shibuya.Once we were there we lined up at one of the many gates. We were about 20th in line at our gate. To our dismay at about 8.45am they started letting people in, we came to the conclusion that they were VIP guests (if there are such thing?). At 9am they started opening some gates, the ones to the right of us were first in.. and people starting RUNNING! Anyway, as soon as ours opened we RAN - you should too! It's good fun if nothing else. Fastpass system!The way I had understood it was different to how it actually works. Example: You get in the gate at 9.30am and get your fast pass from a ride at this time. This means you can't collect another fast pass for ANY ride until an hour later, ie. 10.30am. You can only collect a Fastpass every hour on the half past. I think this is a good system, as it means that even if you turn up at 11am, you still have a chance of getting a fast pass. I think they ran out of Fastpasses at around midday/1pm. The Fastpass machines also give out 'freebies' too!Food!Wasn't expensive as we thought it would be! The Mickey Mouse Icecream was about 400yen, but everything else was about what you'd expect. We brought our own food along but ended up eating from Disneyland anyway.Giftshops!They get crowded in the afternoon after the afternoon parade - if I'd go again I'd buy earlier in the day.Bags!We didn't know how people store bags etc. But all of the rides are pretty harmless (but still good fun). This means that you can take your bags with you on all of the rides. All up such a good day... I didn't want to leave!"
3077,5,12-May,Indonesia,'' Fantastic '',"Great park, full of fun we all love it ! we bought 3day pass and went on wed/23may and again on fri/25may....while the crowds on friday is unbelieveable. most of the attraction's waiting time is 120 minutes...wow...everything is long queue. suggest to avoid going on weekend fri/sat and sun.We had an advantage of going in to the park 15 minutes before its officially open due staying in disneyland hotel. Make use of the fass past to avoid long waiting time.plenty of food and drinks available inside so not to worry."
3078,5,12-May,Singapore,Don't visit on a Saturday,"We went to the park on the first Saturday following the Golden Week thinking it would be much less crowded as holiday makers would have gone the week before.Big mistake. The crowds are much worse than during normal times. It can only be compared to the very crowded days during holidays. We were in the Disney Resort the following Saturday but did not go the park. We noted the number of vehicles in the Disneyland parking lots and could see that this is similar to the previous Saturday. So, the park will be equally as crowded.The only reason we can think of is that these people must have statyed away from the parks last year following the tsunami, and the itch has returned."
3079,5,12-May,Australia,How could you fault Disney?,"Went in May 2012, and crowds were very manageable if you arrive early and prepared to stay until closing.  We stayed in one of the official partner hotels (see review), and were able to go home for afternoon siesta.Some attractions were closed for improvements while we were there, including: Mark twain Riverboat, Tom Sawyer Island Rafts, Explorer canoes, Monsters Inc., Star Tours.  But that's OK because it means we have to come back.To plan your trip try to research which rides will be closed, go midweek (less crowded) and avoid holiday periods in Japan."
3080,5,12-May,United Kingdom,DisneyLand Tokyo Japan,"Great place, so much to see, pack your bags well for walking, wear comfortable casual cloths and shoes. Plenty of places to eat inside. Lockers are available. So much to see and miss so make sure you have the map before you get into the park and make a hit list for attractions then walk around it. All types of food is available. HALAL Food : Not available nearby hotel or theme park."
3081,4,11-Jun,Australia,Value for money,Have been to Tokyo Disneyland a number of times and it is a great day out if you love the rides. It is small enough to navigate your way around and get to all the attractions. It can get very crowded so go early and hit your favourite rides hard. Food isn't great but that is to be expected. Fireworks and parade are great too. Just lots of fun for people of all ages.
3082,5,12-May,Taiwan,Graet place for kids!,"Tokyo Disney Land is a graet place for kis. The show is awesome, the facilities is great, and service is goood. All the staff there is workin with smile. Kids enjpy the time there. But there is one thing I wish which can improve is please shroten the time for line waiting....Little kids can't wait for such a long time for every game. And bathroom is ot popular, need to walk for long to find it."
3083,5,N/A,Malaysia,Awesome!,My 17 months toddler really enjoyed the trip here!
3084,5,12-May,United Kingdom,"Happiest place on earth, except for the queues!","A must if you have time in Tokyo, but don't bother going on a weekend or during school holidays, and try to get there early and secure a few Fast Track passes. Don't forget you can jump the queue as a Single Rider on some rides if you're by yourself. My favorite rides - Splash Mountain and Pirates of the Carribean. The shops are manic at the end of the day so if you see something you like and it's not heavy and bulky, get it then."
3085,4,12-Apr,Canada,Fun day even in the rain,"We arrived at the park nice and early. It rained the whole day , so we purchased rain ponchos. The park is super clean and very well maintained. The park is on the smaller side making it very easy to navigate. Very similar to California. We had a really great time. As per the other parks the food is not that great, but very typical of Disney. We did however find a great Japanese restaurant by the entrance of the park which is much better than burgers and fries. It is worth a visit, but if you have been to another Disney before 1 day is quite sufficient. Then try Disney Sea."
3086,4,12-Mar,New Zealand,Best Disney experience so far!,"Like the people, like the cleanliness, great staff. Even it was very crowded, whole family still enjoy very much!"
3087,4,12-Apr,Vietnam,Fun park with very very nice staff,My daughter enjoyed the park very much. She did the basic and expert Egg Hunt games here and was very happy with the winning gifts. Quite a lot people can speak English herer and they always try their bests to help.
3088,5,12-Apr,United States,Before You Visit...,"I felt that Tokyo DisneyLand and Sea have the best hospitality and attitudes of cast members compared with the parks all over the world. They are very polite, (so Japanese.lol)and always smiling.But if you are an English Speakers like me, you should remind of this.During my stay, I couldn't find cast members who could speak English at all, except at the Infomation Board of Disney Land. I met a girl (tour guide?)who could speak English fluently.She was putting a Mickey Mouse shaped ENGLISH PIN  on her black costume. According to her, those few cast members who are putting this English Pin can speak English,and also we can find English and Chinese speakers at the Main Street House at the entrance of the park. So if you have any questions, you should visit this Information Board(infront of the Pirates of Carribean Attraction) or Main Street House so that you can get some answers. I had so much trouble before I found her.Remember that.;)"
3089,5,12-Apr,New Zealand,Great fun!,"Some rides similiar to the other Disneylands, and others unique to Tokyo - like the amazing Poohs Hunny Hunt.Many rides/shows are in Japanese, but it doesn't matter for the most part as you'll be too busy enjoying yourself!  "
3090,5,11-May,Japan,Dream Land....,lot os fantasies and fun. ...childrens and adults loved it!
3091,5,12-Apr,Australia,Massive,I liked that there are rides that can be enjoyed by small children and parents with infants. I liked that they have built a big house to entertain people while on queue to take a photo with Mickey Mouse. I liked the parades and the massive range of souvenir items. I liked that most shows are spoken in English (aside from Nihongo). What I disliked though is that the rides that are popular had really long queues (which I think is inevitable).
3092,5,12-Apr,United States,"If Disney afficianado, it is good to see","Probably my favorite of 4 - (Anaheim, Orlando, Paris) ...Fairly compact but yet has all the rides you would expect plus a couple of unique ones I had not seen before.  Some cool Japanese touches.  Very well run and special services were very attentive.  Crowds were not overwhelming, but judging by the line capacity that was not used, my guess is that this could get to be long during peak times.  The April weekday with the Easter specials was quite nice!"
3093,4,12-Apr,Indonesia,It is good if it is not crowded,"I went to Disneyland in April 2012, it was good timing as it was sunny and weather wasnt that cold. I went to Disneyland because it didnt get the ticket to Disneysea. i hear Disneysea is better and more for adult. Anyway, i will from it when i get back there. Disneyland for me is good, i had fun and it was like what i thought. Unfortunately, there were a lot of people and i had to stand in line for different length. the worst one was standing for 3 hours for Splash mountain. huh, i am a little bit annoyed with the issuance fast pass because they could make you stand in line longer because they prioritize the visitors with that pass first. Well, better luck next time by buying the fast pass!"
3094,5,12-Apr,United States,BEST Disneyland in the world..!,"We love this Disneyland because it is always different every time we return... the seasonal themes are so fun and the merchandise is always adorable.  We have been to this park for all 4 seasons... Easter Wonderland, Christmas Fantasy, Halloween, and Summer events.  LOVE THIS PARK!"
3095,5,12-Apr,United States,Still have electric light parade,"I am an annual passholder for California Disneyland and to date have gone to the California, Florida, Hong Kong  and now Japan parks.  The staff is typical Disney. . . keep things clean and helpful with directing tourists.  The rides similar, but food definitely not !!  Curry flavored popcorn and soysauce and butter flavored popcorn to go along with the traditional caramel corn and churros !!  They still have the electric light parade here, and it was spectacular !!  Although, they have shorter hours 9am-10pm or 10am-10pm depending on the day, and I have heard that on weekends and summer/vacations the lines can be large and the park packed.  We were lucky, the local kids just went back to school from their spring break and we only waited 5-15 minutes for each ride !!"
3096,3,11-May,United Kingdom,A tiny Disney with long queues,"Having been to most of the other Disney parks around the world I found that this one was a lot smaller than the others - though it was still a good day out. However the queues for the rides were silly long and we got caught in a monsoon. But other than that a great day, will always recommend Disney."
3097,3,12-Apr,Australia,disneyland in a freak tokyo typhoon was crazy.,"The day began with promise Tokyo Disneyland was extremely clean and well kept. The lines for rides were ridiculous almost 3 hours I highly recommend a fast pass otherwise Disneyland is a waste of time.the sheer amount of people there was crazy, almost too many I think.the staff were very friendly and would try to speak English with you.the cost was as excepted, i would suggest a 2 or 3 day pass just so you could going on the rides even with a fast pass. therefore you would be looking at a few hundred aust dollars just for one person. Later in the day a typhoon hit closing most rides and leaving us trapped at Disneyland for 8 hours as the trains stop if there is too much wind and this was the main way back to Tokyo. The taxi line was 5 hours long and we were taunted by Disney buses that would only take people between Disneyland, Disneyland hotel and the train station.I am not sure I would Tokyo Disneyland again you would probably be better to go to the USA Disneyland if your native language is English.best thing - the pirates of the Caribbean ride even if it most was in Japanesedisliked - the linesweirdest thing- the curry popcorn"
3098,5,12-Apr,Australia,This is the way Walt imagined it would be,"Having done Disney to death with our boys visiting Orlando and Anaheim over the last 3-4 years we made a last minute call to do another Disney park on our recent visit to Tokyo.  I won't go into details but simply endorse this as the most convenient (only 20 minutes by train from Tokyo Station) and best value theme park of them all.  When Walt imagined a spotless, manicured, uncrowded (note: Thursday in early April), sparking and efficient Disneyland he certainly nailed it with the wonderful Japanese staff and friendly locals that really bring the dream to reality at this place.  My fashion consious and stylish wife even got into the spirit by donning Minnie ears to join in the fun with Japanese guests - now that's the spirit (no photo allowed!)."
3099,4,12-Feb,United States,Pooh FastPass Required on a Winter Tuesday,"My 12 yr old daughter and I accompanied my husband on a business trip to Tokyo over her school's winter break.  Disney Land was a must-see on her list.  (Shrines?  Museums?  forget about it.)We went on a cloudy, grim Tuesday in February thinking that it would not be crowded.  Alas.  We did not understand how much the Japanese love their Disney.The familiarity of the Magic Kingdom/Disneyland experience, viewed through the Japanese lens, was a once in a lifetime opportunity.  We spent the day comparing the crowd (the Japanese dress up for the occasion, where as the Florida crowd shows a lot more skin ... not that they should) and the food (curry popcorn!) and the rides.  There are a lot more Mickey, Pooh, and Tigger fans and a lot fewer princesses.  The Pooh ride is very different than the US versions, highly recommended even if you have to wait in the standby line.  ""It's A Small World"" is pretty much the same.  It's not cheap (nothing in Tokyo is) but, based on the crowd, and our experiences over our 10 days there, there is a cultural element that makes it absolutely valuable to visit - particularly when traveling with a tween."
3100,3,12-Apr,United Kingdom,Chose wrong time to go...,"We left our hotel in Ueno at 7.30am to get to Disney early to pick up our tickets. We arrived at about 8am to a ""sea"" of people queuing to get in. We eventually got into the park itself at about 9am.We'd timed our visit so our daughter (who teaches English at Japanese schools) could look after us. It was therefore holiday time, and so the park was at bursting point. They closed the park for entry at about 10am, but they should have done so even earlier as the queues were getting silly. For example there was a 60 minute queue for Small, Small World and it was also about 60 minutes to queue for the Fast Pass tickets for Splash Mountain. There were 30 minute queues for popcorn! As other's have reported some rides were queuing for over 200 minutes.The park itself was lovely but we'd only managed to get on 3 of the ""bigger"" rides by noon - the Haunted Mansion, Pirates of the Caribbean and the Jungle Cruise. We then stopped for lunch at the Hungry Bear Restaurant and had some very nice curries.After lunch we switched to the ""smaller"" events and the queues were much smaller - we did ""the Enchanted Tiki Room"", the ""Country Bear Theatre"", the"" Mark Twain riverboat"", and the show at ""Showbase"". After this I'd felt much happier to be doing things rather than just standing in queues.It did seem that there was a lot of queue jumping taking place, with one person joining the queue for a group and the rest of the family joining them later. I was told that this is the norm in  Tokyo Disneyland as the queues are quite often bad and people drop out of the queues to go to rest rooms or get drinks and return, but I think quite a few were being a bit ""naughty"".By 5pm we'd had enough and escaped back to our hotel.Overall it was a lovely park; but an average day as it was spoilt for me by how busy it was - the next day we went to DisneySea which was much, much better!"
3101,5,12-Apr,United States,disneyland,"Disneyland is truly the place where dreams are made of but when its got too many people in it its hard to stay happy. Two children, three adults and 3 hours to wait for a five minute ride does not make for a happy holiday. We should of used the fast pass system. Still nothing in the world compares to standing in front of cindy's castle is amazing"
3102,4,12-Mar,Australia,Use fastpass and pre-buy tickets,"Tokyo Disneyland was great, we had a ball!!  However there are huge queues (some over 3 hours for a single ride) and they have a ""fastpass"" system where you can get a pass to come back at a nominated time (usually a one hour timeframe) and you then skip about 85% of the queue.  HOWEVER - this is only offered until about lunchtime, then there are no more fastpasses and you have to queue!!  Also good to prebuy your tickets - again you jump the huge queues at the entrance and walk straight through.Aside from the queues, great day but very tiring!!  Light parade was spectacular!!  Not just for kids :)"
3103,5,N/A,Malaysia,Absolutely magical,This is my 3rd trip to Tokyo Disneyland n yet I find it more n more interesting. All rides r awesome. Shows amazing. N the most beautiful flowers ever. There were tulips everywhere. The electrical parade is still electrifying. O hv no words to describe except to say that I was the happiest person ever
3104,5,12-Mar,United Kingdom,love Disney,"if you love Disney you will love it here. one thing i would say do not go on Japan school holidays of weekends, queues can be up to 3 hours during peak and fast passes run out with a few hours of park opening at these times"
3105,4,11-Jun,Singapore,The Happy Kingdom,First time went to Disneyland hence i should be happy eh?
3106,4,11-Jun,Singapore,Disneyland in Tokyo,"My first time to Disneyland and we were not disappointed.Park was not crowded as expected but the queue is still long for the popular rides, i shudder to think how bad the lines can be if it was crowded. I missed a few of the rides due to long queuesIt took less than 30mins for us to clear the queue to buy the tickets and enter  the park (after it just opened 30mins before)We saw the characters parade in the afternoons and the evenings.All in all, a good experience we had there"
3107,5,12-Jan,Australia,Great,It's great visiting Tokyo Disney in winter. The crowds are less and the weather is cool.
3108,4,12-Feb,Malaysia,Great!,It was my first time to disneyland and it was great. Character cartoons were friendly to take pictures with.  Do expect long que for most of the rides even it's not peak season. Avoid going on Sat and Sunday as it would be more long que on that day. i manage to play few games and rides at night around 9-10pm because  most of the people went back after the fireworks and it is no need to que.
3109,4,N/A,Australia,Great Family Day Out,"After being a bit disappointed by Euro Disney in Paris, we were reluctant to go to Tokyo Disney! We are glad we did though as it was a great day. An easy train ride to the park from the centre of Tokyo. We were lucky enough to have perfect weather. Recommend Toon Town for the little ones. Our 18 month old son loved it. My only criticism (which wasn't the parks fault) would be that the lines are REALLY long. And it wasn't peak season so would hate to see it in high season."
3110,5,12-Mar,Australia,Great experience and wheelchair friendly,"Even though we spoke very minimal Japanese, the Disney Cast members always tried very hard to assist us.  When you have diminished mobility and use a wheelchair, accessing attractions can be a little more difficult.  But with a Disability access card from Guest Relations, patience, a friendly smile and having someone write in Japanese what you are able to do - eg transfer to a ride vehicle, walk a few steps, walk in the event of an emergency and like to stay in own wheelchair if possible makes things flow much better.  We didn't have any problems.  Experiencing a 6.1 earthquake in the Haunted Mansion holding zone was also an experience we'll remember - we thought was part of the ride!"
3111,5,12-Feb,Singapore,Will return again!,Go early as attractions fast pass goes out really fast!!!
3112,4,N/A,United Kingdom,Not Florida but a good substitute,It's worth coming here just to marvel at all the Japanese ADULTS dressed as Disney characters - especially at Hallowe'en.  Rides not as good as Disney Sea but lots of magic!
3113,5,11-Dec,United States,A Magical Place in the East,"Tokyo Disneyland has everything Disney and much much more.  It is impeccably clean and safe.  But it can also be very very crowded, but because it is orderly, it makes it bearable.  The Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall is one of our favorite restaurants and you can have a delicious Disney themed meal in a cafeteria like setting.  Various food carts and restaurants are available satisfying everyones appetites.  Cinderella's Castle festooned with lights for the Christmas holidays, has a new attraction.  An elevator takes you up into one of it's towers and you are taken to the throne room where you can sit and feel like royalty.  Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, Thunder Mountain, and many familiar rides are located here; but there are Pooh's Hunny Hunt and a Monsters, Inc., ride that are extremely popular.  Get your fast passes or you won't get a chance to experience these rides.  Captain EO, a 3D film with Michael Jackson is still going strong after 20+ years. If you love Disney, this is a must as it has all the charm and excitement that only Disney can give with an extra Japanese touch."
3114,5,N/A,Japan,night parade is awesome!,"you ll never regret to spend a whole day here....have a good sleep before you come, you ll need all your energy to enjoy it 100%!"
3115,5,11-Nov,Malta,Nice people,tokyo is a perty place and people are really intrested in anime and manga you can go here and watch it www.divwave.com
3116,5,11-Aug,Australia,SO SO clean amazing,This is the very best Disneyland in the WORLD Clean and freindly
3117,5,11-Oct,United Kingdom,beautiful magnificant water dispalys and fireworks display each evening.,"I went to visit my son in shin urasayu ,  Japan.. The park opens from 10am to 10 pm each evening, with lots of attractions and american themed rides. There is a water themed show 3 times a day with the best being evening with the firework display and everything lit up, showing cast from all disney and ariel swimming , the animals come out dancing in front of audience on shore, there are hotels in disneyland and disney train to take you to disneyland and disneysea. everyhing is so clean and organised with floats coming out at night all lit up, with the most magnificant displays, theres jubilation in spring and easterparade, summer parades with all disneycast and halloween and xmas parades, open on xmas day, all year round in fact, only closed for a couple of weeks when the earthquake happened. there are food bars, some english food and chicken on sticks and themed restaurants. Disney sea has big band theatre, american themed, with a mixture of english, american and japanese  actors. There is a mini venice in disneysea, and they only serve alcohol in disneysea but not disneyland as it is more child orientated. They provide pushchairs for babys and sell cameras, theres a meet and greet in disneyland from all disney characters and there are shows, i,e, one mans dream, etc, really enjoyed it, on its 10th anniversary of opening , never been to disneyland before ,never  knew there was a disneyland in Japan before  they bought the rights to use its name and they have done really well , its full to the brim each day, everyone lives for disney over there in Japan , ."
3118,5,N/A,Japan,"Disneyland,...I like you.","The best place to enjoy your weekend with your friends. I'm a fan of disney animation, so I love all disney characters."
3119,4,N/A,Japan,THE FIRST BEST COPY OF DISNEY OUT OF AMERICA.,"I truly enjoy seeing even adults becoming like children here.I just hope , it does not get too commerial here."
3120,4,12-Feb,United States,Good reception despite bad weather,"February Disneyland is quite rainy and cold - Disneyland staff, and staff at nearby Sheraton Grande at Maihama were particularly cheerful despite the yucky conditions.Very enjoyable although there for business trip and meetings, easy to see that family oriented efforts are most important on bad weather days!Nice job Disney and Sheraton!This area is quite near Narita airport so also very handy since I had business but was there for just a few nights and did not have to go all the way into Tokyo."
3121,4,N/A,Australia,Fun park but crowded.,"I still managed to enjoy myself despite the huge crowds and sometimes 90 minute lines when I just went to another ride, so I missed some I would have liked.  The parades were spectacular, but by watching only part of the night one I was able to go on several rides while people were watching it.  Unlike the Hong Kong Disneyland, English speakers are not catered for, so rides with comentary are not so good.  Wind prevented the nightly fireworks show."
3122,5,11-Dec,United States,Great day,"My husband and I were in Tokyo the week of Christmas, and as he had never been to a Disney park before, and I'm not a huge hurry to go out of my way to go to Orlando, we decided to spend a day at Tokyo Disneyland. Here are our thoughts!My #1 piece of advice, if you take nothing else away, is if Disneyland is important to you, be sure to buy your tickets in advance either online if possible or from a Disney store in Japan. We wanted to visit both Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo Sea, but when we purchased our tickets several days in advance, Tokyo Sea was already sold out for the days we could possibly make the trip. I'm sure it would have been a very cool park to visit being unique to Japan, but fortunately this didn't ruin our trip. If it's a priority of yours, though, don't skip this step. My #2 piece of advice: One of the details I missed from others' reviews (and tripadvisor reviews were so helpful so keep reading) is exactly how to use the fast pass. Let me tell you that if you and your friend/spouse/child want to ride together, you need one fast pass per person per ride, not one fast pass per family/group. If you make the mistake we did, having only one fast pass for two people (for lack of English instruction at the fast pass machines--and each ride offering fast passes has fast pass machines in front), we did find a cast member who made an exception and made a written note on my fast pass that it could admit 2. The other thing to note is that you don't have to wait to use your fast pass before you can get another one (maybe this is obvious but I somehow missed it!). For example, if your fast pass says your ride time is 4 pm but it's only 10 am when you get it, you don't have to wait 6 hours to get your next fast pass (at which point they are long gone, anyway), you can have as many on your person at a time so long as you only get one fast pass in an hour. So you if you get your first fast pass at 9:01, you can then get additional fast passes at 10:01, 11:01, etc., regardless of how the ride times are staggered throughout the day. My #3 piece of advice: Go on an off-peak day. We went during a school day in December--it was the week before Christmas (hence why later in the week was already sold out) but while Japanese schools were still in session and were very pleased with the crowd level. It was also bitterly cold and gray, and I'm sure this contributed to the manageable crowds--and while we weren't exactly comfortable (take gloves!), it made for very short lines (we never waited longer than 30ish minutes) and our mistakes with the fast pass didn't matter.Other tips:--If you're cold and don't want Disney-themed gloves/hats/scarves, the cowboy-themed Western Wear store of all places sells non-themed adult winter gear, including plain black and gray 3M therma-lined gloves for men and classic ivory/black/brown women's gloves for about $15/pair.--They've really cracked down on even mini-tripods like Joby Gorillapods. I was repeatedly lectured in Japanese; I wouldn't try it if I were you.--Arrive early per other tripadvisor reviews. We were there 45 minutes early and there was already a long queue to enter the park. --Eating at the quick service restaurants didn't break the bank (less than $20 for 2 people) so I'm glad we didn't bother taking in our own food. However, the popcorn buckets are a total rip off. You still have to pay for refills on top of the exorbitant price of the bucket, and we found we saved money buying individual popcorns throughout the day (the chocolate was our favorite! second favorite soy sauce and butter or something, third favorite caramel). Going to Japan for the first time I was most excited about Disneyland, but in truth, though we had a great time, it was far from the highlight. Go forth and have fun, but don't sweat the small stuff and don't blow all your money at Disneyland :)"
3123,4,11-Dec,Netherlands,A Magical day out for all ages,"Travelled in December 2011 with friendsTravelled with friends aged 19/20 and we all still loved disneyland! Makes you feel like a child again! We were lucky enough to visit during the Christmas period so there were so many beautiful christmas decorations. We took a bus from Shinjuku station, the ride was comfortable and it cost us 700yen 1 way. Alot of the rides I must say are more for children. They're weren't many high speed or thrilling rides at all. We loved Splash mountain and our favorite was Space mountain (we went on it twice). Food is pricey but a range is available. All in all a magical day!P.S The Turkey leg is overrated! Me and my friends were so excited to try it because of the numerous reviews about how amazing they are on tripadvisor. We were so dissapointed! It tasted plain and smelt bad (probably needed some gravy?) But worth trying yourself, because the line was sooo long and we saw people sitting around eating it ... and nodding in satisfaction?? So probably best if you try it out yourself. Not the cheapest at 500yen per turkey stick."
3124,3,N/A,Israel,Lots of Fun for the Kids,What you'd expect from Disney with a Japanese twist. It's especially fun to see Main Street USA filled with Japanese kids and parents.
3125,5,11-Feb,United States,Best Disney ever!!!!,"I love Tokyo Disney and Disney Sea.  I have been there almost 20 times. It is by far the cleanest, most civil, immaculate Disney ever.  No one EVER cuts in line.  Even the food was top notch!!! There are different flavored popcorn all over the park.  And the popcorn is fresh (not like Disnyland CA). The rides are extensive.  But the only downside is that it gets super crowded during school breaks.  We used to go during the winter when we could since there were absolutely zero lines.  We had the whole park to ourselves. It was just really cold, so bring coats if u go in the winter.  I love Tokyo Disney!!!!"
3126,1,N/A,China,Too many people,"Way, way too crowded.  Bought an evening ticket and could only line up for one ride before closing time.  Total waste of money - will never go again."
3127,5,11-Oct,Indonesia,Electrical Parade and Fireworks at night was AWESOME!!,"I love Tokyo Disneyland.. they have a bigger castle than the one at Anaheim, CA.I love the Autopia in here rather than in Anaheim, the Autopia track in Tokyo was spacious with lots of garden to explore..Almost every people in here was wearing those cutey Mickey Head accessories thingy.. when most people wore it.. it really made the theme parks MORE alive..Mickey`s everywhere!! although the line was quite long..In October, you should really use rain boots because it did raining some times..Can not miss the Electrical parade at night! and the fireworks.. OMG!! I was stunned looking at em.. B E A U T I F U L...Oh and.. those chocolate flavor popcorn at Disneyland Tokyo.. You gonna be addicted to it.. try yourself! nothing compares!! Yummy.."
3128,4,11-Jun,United States,"A great for a Disney fix, but no pin trading","This is a BUSY place and it fills up fast! A great time, but the crowds can get overwhelming since it's not as orderly as Walt Disney World. When the characters come out, some of them are just mobbed. There are no lines and they get surrounded. It's a bit of mayhem, especially since Mickey comes out under those conditions. Look for the roped aff areas out front if you want a calmer interaction. Otherwise, a good park, even if it's not run by Disney. The biggest negative I have is not only they don't pin trade is the lack of pins. Took me two days to find a place that sold them. Regardless, this park has a lot to offer. A word to the wise, be wary of what popcorn cart you're buying from!"
3129,5,11-May,United States,Probably not the norm,My 11 year-old son and I have been to Orlando's Magic Kingdom several times and have always enjoyed it. This was a great place to go to start his first week in Japan since it was a little familiar and a little ... Japan. Due to the recent tsunami it was far less crowded than usual but due to Disney's reputation they were still fully staffed. It was definitely worth the tme and money and will come back with his younger brother and even with crowds I'll expect that we'll have a great time.
3130,5,12-Jan,Bolivia,Great; give yourself enough time,Service was incredible. The rides are good too. Make sure you do the Tomorrowland inside roller coaster.There is almost no vegetarian food. Disneyland should cater for the 10-15% of the population who are vegetarian. We need to eat too!
3131,4,12-Jan,United States,Worth seeing if a Disney Junkie,This is a must see if you like Disney... is nice to see similar rides to those in Florida and California... but to see the local Japanese twist is neat!!  The only negative thing I have for this Disney (and I noticed it both times I have been here) is the lack of shirts that have Disney Tokyo on it (such as a golf shirt) and that there are no pins available with Tokyo on them.Other then that go and enjoy a day at Disney!
3132,4,11-Oct,Australia,Similar to the other Disneyland parks,"While similar to the other parks, it is what you come to expect from Disney. The Main Street is undercover (due to the climate in Japan no doubt) & that's a good idea. Lots of souvenir shops like the USA parks. The exterior of the buildings are beautifully done. Character meals are very popular so you must book well in advance to get into the restaurants for these meals. The street parade was very unique & well worth seeing as were the fireworks. Toontown is smaller. Queues mid week are almost non existent so we really made use of that. Tickets can be purchased athe gate or from most hotels. Prices are on par to the USA parks. Not cheap but definitely worth a visit or two!"
3133,5,11-Apr,United States,"Not just for kids, great for couples as well","A place full of fun and adventure. We were lucky too that there were not that many people during our visit so we got to ride and see all the attractions. People tend to flow counter-clockwise looking at the map starting from Tomorrowland so better to go against the flow of the crowd.Don't leave early, the Electrical Parade at night was so awesome and romantic. Read about our adventure and see our photos here: http://www.travelingyoungcouple.com/2011/10/japan-tokyo-disneysea-and-tokyo.html"
3134,5,N/A,Japan,Fantasy Land for Everyones,Great for a family visit. TDL is focusing its' various rides and facilities most likely on family segmented visitors whereas TDS is on adult visitors.Bet you can enjoy and will miss this place a lot when you are getting out of the park.   
3135,5,11-Dec,Singapore,My best Disneyland,"I don't want to compare but i can only say this is the best one that i've ever been before...We've 2 families with 4 young kids (6,3,2,2) and we check in to the park at about 10am...till 11pm!!!The Tokyo disneyland has got a lot (i meant really a lot a lot) of fun and activities here... Those who go with the young kids can rent a stroller from the entrance and don't bother about bringing one! Also, please make sure you check out the leaflet for the schedule of the street show... these are not to be missed out at all... one advice: please bring your own towel/light picnic carpet so you could have your picnic while watching the show... of course, don't miss out your food and titbits... don't worry, buy from stores along the street...You should also plan on your journey in the park as some of the attraction has got some specific timing/requirement. Some are kids friendly, some are not. It will be a big waste of time if you think you do not plan ahead of time and randomly selecting your attraction to visit as the park is BIGggg... no kidding.You should also plan for break along your way but try to avoid the peak hour as every attractions are full of people... and some (actually almost everyone) would require some timing for queuing up....literally 15-2 hours... but you may try to ask for some ""express lane"" ticket before you choose the type of ticket to buy at the entrance... money can drive evil... is definitely true!Set aside that, the night show is fantastic... with the lighting and music that make it like a wonderland and magic land with all disney characters and special lighting effects... We checked out at 11pm but none of us feel tired at all...the kids are asking for more rides! Oh well, the adults have to tell them it is the bed time, and we're visiting to DisneySea tomorrow for more fun!"
3136,5,11-Dec,Australia,"Simply incredible - fantastic Disney experience, a must see!","This was our 7th trip to the Tokyo Disney Resort....we are big fans of the Mouse, having been to Disneyland, DCA and WDW quite a few times.The Japanese experience is something else altogher - we love it. You must go - DisneySea is definitely worth the second day - in fact if I were only able to do one of the parks (Disneyland or DisneySea) - I would recommend choosing DisneySea as it is so incredibly unique and different from the other Disney Parks around the world.Love it!"
3137,5,11-Jun,Indonesia,A Real Dream Land!,"Tokyo Disneyland is my dreaming place ive wanted to visit. When i entered, i just stepped my feet in a dream land ! such a great, very very very fantastic! fairytail dream like. The attractions are very outstanding. You'll feel like, you dont want to go out there. Just experience it by urself :D"
3138,5,11-Dec,United States,Just like LA - mostly,"It was fun to compare the rides here with the rides at Disneyland.  (We go there once a year.)  Small World, Buzz Lightyear, Captain EO, Thunder Mountain, are all the same except the lines are longer.  Fast Pass lines get really long - we were only able to get 2 FP's before they sold out for the day.  Great ride:  Pooh's Honey Hunt - very popular!  Also take the Jungle Cruise in Japanese.  You can tell it's the same jokes, only in another lanugage."
3139,5,11-Dec,Singapore,Magical experience!,Love tokyo disneyland..Been to HK & LA disneyland before but nothing beat tokyo disneyland.
3140,5,11-Dec,Australia,Excellent park,One of our favorite Disney parks. The Japanese have created a superb experience in every way. The language barrier is not a problem. You must ride pooh's hunny hunt - even if you are only a child at heart. 
3141,5,11-Dec,New Zealand,A Christmas Treat,Tokyo Disneyland is so well organised and the young people  who work there make you feel so very welcome and special. There is so much to do in a very clean and attractive park like environment. Going there at Christmas was amazing. We have many special family photos especially of the parades and the in front of the castle. Staying for the night parade is a must do.
3142,5,11-Dec,Thailand,The most attentive theme park I have been to so far,"The goods:- Very attentive staff. Have at least 2 staffs in the front of each attraction and more inside. We went on a rainy day and still they put a staff every 50 meters or so out side to accommodate the park goers!- Most of the park staff speak English and if some of them couldn't, they will get some one that can respond to your question/request right away.- We went on Thursday, December8, 2011 and the crowd was perfect. Wait time was only 30 max for each ride and NONE on some rides. This was the first time in my Disneyland experience I waited for only 25 minutes to get on Space Mountain!! Not sure if this was because it was raining or Winny the Pooh ride was out.- Delicious food and snacks throughout the park. Popcorn was on the expensive side but the food we had for lunch and dinner wasn't. It's very comparable for the food we have outside the park.- We can get on the rides we wanted without having to wait forever. (Average of 15 minutes per ride).- They let you bring in food and drinks. Not like other Disneyland.- Very family friendly.The not so goods:- Night electric parade was cancelled due to rain.- A bit chilly (for parents) but my son didn't seem to be affected by it.- Some rides/attractions narrations were in Japanese.- Too bright in the ""It's a small world"" ride you can see the ceiling and air ducts inside. Cute dolls as everywhere else but just realized how much difference it was with just lighting adjustment.- The Winny the Pooh ride (which supposed to be its best ride) was closed.Conclusions.- Nice, clean, fun park. Will be back the next time we go back to Japan.Tips.- Go on week days to avoid crowd.- Check weather forecast and go when it's not raining.- Buy ticket in advance at Disney stores spreading across Tokyo area (you can check the location at Tokyo Disneyland's website) to avoid long lines at entrance booths."
3143,5,11-Jan,Australia,Trip of a Life Time,Disneyland is every kids dream and disneyland in tokyo is no different. Everything was fantastic. Ensure you get there early to get a fastpass or two. You can only get one at a time. Avoid holidays to get the most out of the day.
3144,5,11-Dec,United States,Loved Tokyo Disneyland!!,Wow I have to say I was overly impressed with all of the rides I went on at Tokyo Disneyland. My husband and I stayed for a few days and went to both parks (separate review on DisneySea!). I highly highly recommend going on a weekday if you can. We used the fastpass (which is free!!!) for a few rides but never stood in line for longer than 45 minutes. Everything about Disney is magical and Tokyo did not disappoint! I am so sad that I am not there right now!!! :)
3145,4,11-Nov,Japan,The Happiest Place in Japan!,"We went to Tokyo Disneyland at a later part of the day, after catching Cirque du Soleil and sunset was early so we mainly enjoyed the park's night atmosphere.Christmas decorations were out on full force since it's only a month away, and that made for beautiful illuminations all over the park. That alone was something nice to enjoy by itself. Since we went on a Sunday, the park was understandably packed, and I mean PACKED with visitors. Never underestimate the crowd size when visiting Tokyo Disneyland, lol. In about 6 hours, we managed to get on 4 rides with each averaging a 90-100 minutes waiting time. Having been to Universal Studios Japan, we knew what to expect and so were mentally prepared for the long wait.The popular Pooh ride was closed for maintenance and I highly recommend would-be visitors to comb through the official site for information on which rides are open etc to avoid disappointment and waste of time running from one side of the park to another. By the way, when we were there only 1 ride had any Fast Pass left at around 3pm, so plan accordingly.The night parade was beautiful and the fireworks near Cinderella's Castle at the end were a nice touch to end our trip for the day :)Definitely better than Disneyland Park in LA in terms of maintenance too."
3146,5,11-Nov,Australia,great day,great place for day out.shows were terriffic and parade excellent.if your in tokyo make sure you do this you wont regret it.
3147,5,11-Nov,United States,So much fun,Some tips Get there early! They only have about five rides that offer fast pass so if you don't get there early (aka 1 hour prior to opening) you will not see a wait shorter than 45 minutes. We got ours to Monsters Inc Ride and Seek and thank goodness we did (it never got under a 3 hour wait the entire time we were there) I highly recomend staying till park close as the park empties out since the monorials stop running back to the city and you can jump on a lot of rides! 
3148,4,11-Nov,Singapore,Great,"What can you say...its Disneyland.Kids loved it...It would be better if there was an express pass, as the lines are too long for young kids (45-90 minutes for the popular lines, and 20+ for even the simplest of things).Otherwise, a great day out."
3149,4,11-Oct,Japan,A land of fairytales - Discount tickets if purchase locally & visit on wkday,"Do note that Disneyland often provide discount ticket for wkday visit which can be purchased from Tokyo convenience store eg 7-11, Lawsons, eg Christmas season wkday visit ticket frm convenience store now offer 5,800Yen, which save 400Yen compare to online 6200Yen. It's 5-10mins walk frm Maihama Station, suggest you visit on weekday bcoz it's super crowdy in wkend, u might end up wastin 2-3hrs on queuing for a show/game. Do note to get a fast pass to save queuing time & check the show time prior to queuing"
3150,2,10-Dec,Australia,Not worth the wait,"I enjoyed a sketching class, but other than that we didn't go on many rides because the wait was way too long!"
3151,5,11-Apr,New Zealand,Dreams come true...,My young son and I visited TD a few days after it had been reopened due to damage in the car parks from the big earthquake. We had hoped to get to Disney Sea as well but that was shut for another week or so.My son is 7 yrs old the the majority of attractions were perfect for him. The queues on this day were pretty much non exsistant due to the timing of the reopening and it was a Tuesday. I had been a few times in years gone by and had struck days where the queuing was at  least 2hrs/ ride! This time we arrived at 1pm and had plently of time to do everything we wanted by 9pm. The Electric parade was gorgeous and even though there were no fire works and most of the park was quite dark due to power conservation that only added to the atmoshere. Well worth the visit and highly recomended!Food is expensive and not so yummy but it is fine. We took snacks and only bought some special treats and had a curry dish for dinner.
3152,4,11-Jan,India,Excellent experience.,"I really had a great time spending a day at disneyland. They really have very good shows and rides. Night light show is just amazing and I could never forget the meeting with the Mickey. One day is not enough for completing the entire rides. It may be better to take a two days pass, which is a bit expensive but worth of it."
3153,5,11-Jan,Australia,Fun for adults and children,What can I say about Disneyland? You just have to do it to experience the magical feelings for young and old. There is something for everyone!
3154,5,11-Sep,Malaysia,Love it to the max!,"I looooove Tokyo Disneyland! The workers are very helpful (especially with me carrying along 1.y.o toddler), and the park is amazingly clean! There are a lot of restaurant and souvenir shops for you to choose at reasonable price. The only thing is everywhere needs to queue, BADLY. The entrance queue was very long, the waiting time for rides ranging from 30-90mnts, and even you have to queue to buy your lunch during peak hour. Besides, the baby's room is perfect. Someone will assist you, and they even change the mat everytime you're done with changing diapers. They have proper place for you to feed your baby (high chair, colorful room, water dispensers, baby's food and diapers). But it is recommended that you stay in nearby hotel (disney hotel or official hotels) as you can go back to refresh yourself, and get back in to disneyland within 1/2hour to enjoy your evening parade. Besides, the crowd is much lesser at night, and the queue is much shorter, some of the rides you dont even have to wait! I will absolutely come again if given a chance."
3155,5,11-Oct,Australia,Halloween at Disneyland!,"Tokyo Disneyland makes quite an impression at halloween! Compared to our summer visit in 2010, with Japan school holidays and the heat and humidity, it was a pleasant change to be there in late October with sunny skies and comfortable weather to enjoy all the many attractions at Disneyland.Rated as perhaps the best Disney park anywhere, the day we visited the park was crowded and many visitors dressing up for Halloween gave the park a great atmosphere.The highlights; Disney's Halloween Street ""Welcome To Spookyville"" daytime parade and the 'Dreamlights' electrical parade in the evening.Both parades were excellent especially the color and lights of the 'Dreamlights' parade.Taking the walk to all the Disney 'lands' in Adventureland is ""Minnie Oh! Minnie"" at Theatre Orleans. A fast paced musical show with all the stars and Minnie being the star attraction. Presented with Latin music, this is a must on the day's itenerary, fantastic show.Westernland presents 'Super-Duper Jumpin' Time' at the Plaza Pavillion Bandstand that is a lively and fun show with Mickey and his Disney pals, mainly for the kids.In Fantasyland don't miss a boat ride through 'It's A Small World...After All."" This is a delight and represents the children of the world in an animated exhibit full of charm and wonderment. Line up to get on a boat was less than ten minutes, the crowd moves rapidly through and no long waiting times, which is a real bonus.In Toontown, meeting Mickey in his house takes about an hour wait, but once inside the stars house you get to see some old movies he starred in before heading to the backstage area and finally into the film studio dressing room where Mickey..the legend...is waiting. Take photos, have an official one taken as well, there's no rush through and after the long wait, this is worth waiting for.A ride on the Mark Twain Riverboat was easy and no delays getting aboard for a leisurely trip down the Rivers Of America in Westernland.  The centrepiece in front of Cinderella Castle was decorated with Halloween that had a little spooky feel about them but well done.During the day parade, ghosts, and spooky creatures appear from the floats to entertain while Mickey leading the parade looks like some sort of Dracula with big cape on.For evenings at Disney from October onwards take a warm jacket as it tends to get a bit chilly late afternoon.Souvenir buying is best outside the park in Bon Voyage, where you can buy exactly what is on sale in the park gift stores. However, the park's stores get very crowded and busy, especially after the parades when most visitors are in the Main Street region where the shops are located.Individual gift stores around the park seem a little less busy.Centre Street Coffee House provides reasonably priced meals from breakfast to lunch and dinner, the menu changes to suit the time of day. Our breakfast meal consisted of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, toast, complimentary iced water and yoghurt with jam. Not great value for money but nonetheless tasty but not a fan of yoghurt anyway.Pick up a souvenir bottle of water with Tokyo Disneyland on it... and while baseball caps for adults are not available (this is Disney after all, made for kids!) it's not easy to find any fridge magnets or keyrings either. But there are plenty of other great souvenirs to remember the visit to Disneyland.Take your place a good half hour before the electrical parade to get a good view, the day parade runs a few times during the day.Overall great day and as expected no disappointment, for big rides you can use Fast Pass option but main helpful hint is to plan your day when you arrive after getting your guide map and entertainment schedule. Not taking time to go through the guides you'll be totally disappointed to miss something you really want to see or ride on.It was also great to see the spirit of Japan returning after March 2011 event and all is going pretty well as normal just the way we like it. Another visit? Possibly, never say never!"
3156,2,11-Jan,United Kingdom,is retro cool though,Needs modernising very old but known to be. Many rides shut in winter but they should lower price or tell you at gate no fair really.
3157,5,11-Sep,Australia,The best disneyland ever,"We have visited many of the Disneyland Parks in different countries around the world.  We find Tokyo Disneyland and Disneysea the best of all.  Particularly the cleanliness and manners of the Japanese people is very refreshing.  This trip was with our 11 year old granddaughter.  It was her second trip to Japan and Tokyo Disneyland with us (we had a trip there last year-2010) and she absolutely loves the Parks of course.  She is also very taken with the culture of Japan and would love to be able to visit there more often.  All in all a very successful and enjoyable trip.  Japan is a country which is so easy to travel around.  Even without very much of the language, we had no trouble at any time.  All were helpful and polite and friendly.  Couldnt recommend Tokyo Disneyland enough and also Japan."
3158,4,11-Oct,United States,Not for the faint of heart!  But can be a great time.,"When you decide to go to Tokyo Disneyland, you agree to enter THE MOST CROWDED Disney theme park on the planet.  No exaggeration.  Read up about going and plan out your day.  Always best to arrive early and bring your own lunch.  Prices for food are reasonable to slightly expensive so save your money for dinner at the park.  (The lines for food can also be very long!)The ""cast members"" at Tokyo Disneyland are beyond helpful and if it is your birthday, make sure to let the people know at the ticket gate.  They will give you a sticker and every Disney employee who notices will wish you a happy birthday!Get there early and use the fast passes whenever you can.  There is a website for your cellphone in which you can check the queues for each ride.  (Not sure if there is English version)  Fireworks at night as well as parade are a must see too!  Also try your luck for a special show at the lottery place too.Good luck and have fun!"
3159,5,11-Oct,Thailand,Njoyable day for every one,"Avoid Public Hols and Weekends as queues are very bad.For few rides , will recommend to take Fast pass or can wait upto 100-150 min.1 day is not enough as its huge and long queues. Should take 2 day pass if want to cover all the rides and shows.Thier special evening parade like Hallowen etc are must watch ( seasonal)If you are in Tokyo, then shouldn't miss it. If you love the rides and Disney."
3160,4,11-Sep,Australia,the happiest place on earth,"The crowds are often heaviest over the weekend and on the 2 days before and after.If its crowded, use the fast pass system..the Queen of Hearts cafeteria serves quick and easy food..there is always a table.There is a sukyiaki  fast food style meal available on the space terrace too."
3161,5,11-Mar,Australia,TWe fly to Japan just to come here every year!!!  This place is like our second home :),"I have been to California Disney several times but for some reason, I prefer BOTH TOKYO DISNEY PARKS!!! We always stay at the same hotel when we visit which is Mitsui Garden Hotel Prana Tokyo Bay and the have a free Disney bus that runs back and forth constantly!!!  When my family comes here we ALWAYS do a 4 day park pass...You would be suprised at how crowded the park gets and how long the lines can be!!!  But the cleanliness and hospitality of the park is AMAZING..Its one of the main reasons why we never bother going anywhere else...Not to mention, everyone gets into the whole DISNEY vibe and I become a kid all over again evertime im there!!!!"
3162,5,10-Nov,United States,One of the best Disney Parks.. Ever,"I have to admit that i put my visit date as November 2010, but it wouldn't let me set a date any farther back. so.. the story is this...Since the late 1980's I've been travelling to Japan with Tokyo Disneyland being a must see for most of those numerous trips.  I've watched it evolve from one park, to a park and a hotel, to 2 parks, 2 more themed hotels and numerous other things.. like the Ikspiari shopping area. It is, and always has been, one of the cleanest, friendliest, and easiest Disney park to get around.  I've been to Disneyland in Anaheim lots of times, and to Walt Disney World in Florida too.  My absolutely favorite is still Tokyo.  The park layout is similar their American Cousins, but for some odd reason, seems to work better as far as guests trying to get around the park.  The attractions are definitely different from the ones in the U.S. In particular, Pooh's Hunny Hunt at Tokyo Disneyland is 100 times more fun than the ones in the U.S. Between the trackless system, to hunny pots that spin and whirl around each other, to bouncing up and down with tigger, it's fun for kids of all ages.. While the wait time can be long at times ( if you want a fast pass, go first thing in the morning), but it's definitely worth it.  It's one of the only rides that my older aunt will ride.  She loves it! Then you have the food, and the shopping.  Their food selections are more widely varied than at other disney parks. You still have your turkey legs, and pizza, but they have other items too... peanut butter and jelly sandwich meals and such.  Some of these you can purchase in a souvenir lunch box.. The character goods seem to be cuter, and have more variety in Tokyo than anywhere else.And of course.. I can't forget popcorn!  They have so many different flavors it's crazy.. So far we've come across curry, strawberry, capuccino, chocolate, sea salt, pepper, honey, etc.  All were good and the popcorn buckets are cute!! By far, Tokyo Disneyland is one of my favorite Disney parks.  If you have to see one park aside from Disneyland in Anaheim, I'd say this is it."
3163,5,10-Nov,Singapore,Best theme park anytime!,"This is one place where I went in 2 of the 4 trips I made to Japan last year. Really well organised and certainly the happiest place on earth! My advice for 1st timers is that you have to decide in which order you want to organise your programme once inside the theme park. That is deciding between parades, shows and rides. There is usually 2 parades, one in the daytime and one at night, both are very different and are must see events. Take note of the times for these which are clearly stated on the pamphlets. Then note the showtimes for the more classic shows like Minnie Oh Minnie! You can then use the time in between to do your favourite rides. Be sure to wait at the entrance at about 230pm, where alot of the Disney characters are actually near the main entrance posing for photos. Leave shopping to the very last - it's just not worth carrying all your shopping bags thru'out with you the whole day. There's a fireworks display at night as well but this may not happen if the weather is not favourable."
3164,5,N/A,Australia,Fantastic day out for the young at heart,"I arrived an hour before opening & there was already a line up. By the time it opened at 9 am the crowds were enormous. The crowd entered quickly & everyone ran to get their fast pass to their favorite, popular ride. The rides were great but you will have a big wait for the popular ones if you dont have a fast pass They have shops throughout the park selling Disney souvenirs. Plenty of food & drink outlets. Smoking is permitted only in designated areas. The parade of lights looks amazing in the evening. The day I went (which quickly turned to night) there were no fireworks due to unfavorable winds. A great day out for any age!"
3165,3,11-Sep,Thailand,Not set up for English speaking tourists,"We have been to four other Disney parks (USA x 2, Paris and HK) and although Tokyo Disney is huge and has everything you can possibly ask for in terms of rides, it is not really set up for foreigners. This is evident in the fact that all the shows (and we love the shows!) are in Japanese, all ride instructions in Japanese, ATM's don't accept foreign cards. Disappointing for such a huge set up like Disney. Incredibly long hot and exhausting wait times for rides with a phenomenal amount of people streaming through the gates. God Bless fast passes, only down side is that of course, you can only have one per person at any given time. And, merchandising in the myriad of stores, was very weird. No Tink stuff! She has been banished! Plenty to purchase of many of the other Disney characters but some significant absences which made my kids a bit sad! Pricey but worth going, we got a three day pass through our hotel (Hilton Tokyo Bay) which was much cheaper than the price quoted on the website. Overall, we still love Disney,  but don't think we would choose to go back to this one."
3166,4,11-Jun,Australia,Be Prepared,"We had a good time at Tokyo Disneyland but here are a few hints:1. If you are staying in Shinjuku, buy your entry passes at the  Takashimaya Times Square Disney Store and avoid the queues.2. Yes, yes, yes - get there early and use Fast Passes.3. Don't think it will be quiet just because it is a bit rainy and a weekday.4. Even if you are adult, do the Winnie-the-Pooh Hunny Hunt ride, it is unique to Tokyo Disneyland and well worth it.  5. If you are English speakers (like us) don't bother with the translator screens if you are doing the Tiki Room - it just distracts you from the the cool stuff going on.  6. On the day we went things were quiet crowded between about 10 and 4 but the crowds seemed to drop off significantly by late afternoon, so hang in there!"
3167,2,11-Aug,United Kingdom,Spend your money somewhere else,No fireworks -  what a disappointment.No hand driers in the lavatories (they say it is to save electricity! So why  not turn off some of the lights)No Cirque du SoleilNo Indiana Jones attractionBut no reduction in price - what a rip-off!I cannot understand why people are happy to pay huge prices for entry in to a resort where they are then expected to queue all day.
3168,5,10-Oct,Canada,Fantastic Time! I should have worn better shoes though!,"My Husband and I went to Disneyland in Tokyo. It was amazing. Three things to know before you go:-Wear proper shoes! I can't stress this enough.-Go as a ""Single Rider"" and you will wait 20 minutes instead of 2 hours!-Get your Fast Passes as soon as you can! I would suggest reading your Map as soon as you get in to see which rides don't allow single riders, and get the Fast Passes for those as soon as possible. If you don't care about sitting beside the person that you are with, you can go down the ""Single Rider"" lanes and save yourself an hour or two PER RIDE! Unfortunately we didn't know about this until the next day when we went to Disney Sea, but it made our day there a million times better.This park is amazing, and if you follow the three things mentioned above, it will be a perfect day! The food is of course really expensive, but fantastic quality.The rides are all in Japanese, but that just adds to the experience of being in Japan :) You can still catch what's going on.Get there early! and if you can afford it, stay in the Disney Hotel. We didn't and by the end of the day you are so tired, the last thing you want to do is make your way back to your hotel, although the trains are easy to get around.Enjoy!!!"
3169,5,10-Sep,N/A,Where dreams come true,"I don't know about other Disney Parks, but this one in Japan is really a place where all seems (and is) perfect: everything is nice, the services are above any expectations, and the prices are equilibrate.I've been visiting it almost every year since I am a kid, and I never get tired of it.I just recommend avoiding the summer because of the high temperatures in Japan."
3170,5,11-Aug,United States,Fun for any Disney fan,"The park was immaculate (as any Disney park is - but even more than usual).  They had a few different rides than in the U.S, and the entrance is different than the U.S. main streets, but other than that, it follows the same general layout as Disneyland/ the Magic Kingdom. The people were friendly - both the guests and workers.  A lot of rides are in Japanese, but of course, it didn't matter.  A must-see for any Disney fan!  If you go in the summer, bring sunscreen and an umbrella, some of the rides' lines were in the sun and the sun with the humidity are rather unbearable in the summer."
3171,5,10-Sep,Australia,best disney park by far,"disneyland and disneysea Tokyo were exceptional not only in service, but cleanliness, friendlliness and ease of access around the facilities.   My husband and i have done disney Paris, California and Hongkong too but Tokyo far exceeds the others.   A must have is the caramel popcorn which permeates the whole park - delicious and addictive.  Disneysea is ""out of this world""   with rides that you will not have experienced anywhere else in your life.   Wide and open spaces great train system and entry/exit to park _ i can honestly say 4 days were not enough"
3172,5,11-Feb,Singapore,Today is a fantasy,"3 chilling rides were closed on the day I visited disneyland. One thing to remember, get the fast pass once you enter. To note: many people will be rushing for it.The fast pass allows you to play a ride without queuing up in the specific timing stated on the ticket. It's free. So no worries that you have to pay additional charges for it. Once you get the fast pass of one ride, you will have to wait for about an hour or so to be eligible for another fast pass. Getting the fast pass helps in such a way that you need not queue for some rides however, it's impossible to get the fast pass for ALL rides. So eventually, there will be 1 or 2 rides that you would have to stand in the queue. Overall, some rides are thrilling and some are enjoyable except for one, Captain EO if I'm not wrong. It's this 4D screening about Michael Jackson and I see that most of the people fell asleep halfway through.Remember to try the turkey leg located between Westernland and Critter Country. Everyone will be holding it and eat while walking. Remember to note the afternoon parade and night parade timing so that you need not contemplate whether to give up queuing to watch the parade or to continue queuing. Watching of the parade is a must in Disneyland as that's the only time you see all the disney characters. The night and day parade has different concept so it's still worth it to stay till 8pm to catch the night parade. The pizza bar is rather popular and its taste is good. Do pray for less wind so that there will be fireworks display in the night. P.S.All rides are communicated through Japanese so do not feel sad/irritated that you don't understand them as what matters is what you see."
3173,4,11-Mar,N/A,Find Your Inner Mickey/Minnie,"Best to buy your ticket beforehand as there are long queues at the counter. Check the internet on where to buy them. Go in the morning when the gates open and obtain a map of the place. My advice is to pick the rides that you would really like to go on because seriously, you will not be able to go on all the rides due to hours and hours of waiting to get on. Many Japanese youngsters have unlimited-entries-in-a-year tickets which they really make full use of. And these are the ones who make up the bulk of the visitors milling around Disneyland. Be prepared to stand in line for up to two hours for a popular ride! The best thing to do is to go on those ones first like roller coasters or the Monsters Inc ride. If you leave them till later, your chances of getting on them are almost nil! This is due to the fact that there are early passes that one can obtain. Sorry I cannot remember the term for it but you can obtain a pass which will schedule you for a later time to go on a particular ride (the machine dispensing it is setup outside each ride). At least you know you won't really have to queue for that one! Leave the shopping till later since the shops will be there the whole time. Do look out for souvenirs like chopsticks and rice moulds that can only be bought in Tokyo Disneyland. No other Disneyland will have those items. And don't forget to buy your Mickey/Minnie ears EARLIER in the day and not when the day is almost over!"
3174,5,11-Jul,Singapore,"Throughly enjoy the attarction, one of the Best!","Well maintain and it still look like new. We spend a day at Disneyland and still not enough (even just 2 of us). Please go early! The park is very much family oriented. Rides is much more ""easy going"" and ""less excitement"" - if you are looking for interesting rides, this might not be the place. Overall, our objective is to be there and enjoy our holiday - and we do! Thank you Micky!"
3175,5,11-Jun,N/A,Just like the Magic Kingdom in Florida!,"I LOOOOVE Disney so I was very excited to go here! This park is nearly identical to the Magic Kingdom in Florida, with a few tweaks!  Main Street actually has a ""roof"" to protect you from the rain and sun, which is awesome! But the lands themselves are pretty similar, although the wait time was averaging 100 minutes for everything, even kiddie rides. ToonTown was bigger than the one in Florida and had some extra things, including Roger Rabbit's Toon Spin ride or something like that. I didn't get to go cuz of the wait time, but I'm sure it was fun. Space Mountain was closed, but I would have waited to go on that. I did go on Splash Mountain - one of my favorite rides of all time! As a side note, getting here from Tokyo is easy  - there is a train station right outside the park. The Tokyo Disneyland hotel is also right there and it is GORGEOUS! It's huge and so beautiful - if you can stay there, you should!"
3176,5,11-Jul,United States,"Amazing park, only overshadowed by sister park next door!","Take all of the Magic Kingdom's across the world, pull out the best stuff (rides, staff, food, etc.) and put it together.  Bam! You've got Tokyo Disneyland!  Seriously, great park a must visit even if you've been to other Disney's or not a huge Disney fan.Tip - Do the Winnie the Pooh ride.  Even if not a Winnie the Pooh fan the ride will blow you away!"
3177,4,11-May,Singapore,Wow!!!,"Actually, seems like all the Disneyland have the same rides. So this trip is more for the kids.Since I have mentioned that all the Disneylands have similar rides, so what make Tokyo Disneyland stands out?It is the Japanese culture and hospitality. I am not saying other Disneylands staff is rude or bad but Japan has brought Disney hospitality to a new level. Staff is polite and the park is very clean. I would even say that it is spotless.All rides are well maintained and staff is helpful. Disneyland is more suitable for small kids. If you have older kids and are adventurous enough, I heard Disney sea have more thrilling rides.Try to be there as early as possible so you will have more time to explore this huge park."
3178,5,10-Aug,Philippines,Disney Magic!,"I got all the things that I expected from Disneyland. Nice, fun, kid-safe rides and of course, really long lines. Although there are some rides that I liked, I still prefer the nearby Disneysea."
3179,4,11-Feb,Singapore,Unforgettable night parade!,"Very lovely place for families and kids. Be indulged in the lovely world in this disneyland! I felt that I'm in a fairy tale land when visiting this disneyland! All the rides are suitable for all ages. I just can't forget the night parade there, so beautiful and nice with their lights! The service there is so wonderful! Needless to say, the place is very clean and you can book your own seat on the floor while waiting for the night parade to start! People there were very co-operative and considerate when watching the night parade. Wonderful place to be at."
3180,4,11-Feb,United Kingdom,Good...not great. queuing could be improved,"The rides here are not good - think alton towers ten / fifteen years ago, and the queues are quite bad. The queues to get in are the worst though, as the system simply doesn't seem to make any sense and they move people to different queues for unknown reasons. we arrived at 8:50 and didn't enter the park until 9:40. a previous traveller said to make sure you get a map in english at the gates - good call! everywhere else the maps are japanese. the shows etc are also in Japanese, but still enjoyable, and dont require queueing for ages!They have a fast pass system, but often there is a 30 min queue just for that, but this is better than the 1 hour minimum queue for the smaller rides and a 2/3 hour wait for the larger ones. They have a lot of staff, and the place is spotless, perhaps more people could be used to entertain the queues! the Japanese seem to LOVE so sit to be entertained, and they spread out mats along the parade route an HOUR before it starts...i wouldn't worry, there are plenty of vantage points, and the parades are great - the highlight of the day. i would suggest taking food with you, as it is very pricey. overall a good day, but if you want to go on all the rides you will need more than 1 day and a LOT of patience. ( i went on a Thursday, off peak season no holidays etc and it was still busier and the queues were worse than a school holiday weekend at alton towers!)worth  a visit, but this is my first disney experience and i wont be planning another one for a good while!"
3181,5,10-Aug,Canada,awesome family experience,"We spent one day at Tokyo Disneyland last summer with two small children (3 and 5). We had a great time and will definitely visit again.It's important to buy tickets in advance and - if you want the most ouf of your day - arrive at least an hour before they open. You'll see a line-up already! Make a plan, check the rides and the map, once they open the door the crowd will be overwhelming, but if you run, you can get to your favourite ride with no need to wait. From that point, expect 1-2 hours wait for the popular rides.  We had an exact plan what we wanted to try, one of us lined-up and the other went around with the kids to meet the characters in the park. My kids got to meet all princesses and the crowd around them wasn't as bad as it was around Mickey and Minnie Mouse. To meet Mickey, we had to wait more than 2 hours.  If you want to watch shows, make sure to be there very early, all sitting and standing places fill up quick. Most people bring a mat to sit to watch shows and the parade."
3182,5,11-Feb,United Kingdom,Perfect day out for all ages,"This is definitely worth a visit if you are going to Tokyo. There are only a few big rides, but there is plenty to see and do. The Perfect day out."
3183,5,10-May,United Kingdom,Fantastic!,"There is Magic in every corner of Tokyo Disneyland!! Spend here a day or more, to get a bit away from the big city rush, and fell like a kid. The kids will love it. I did not mention big differences between tokyo disneyland and paris disneyland, to be honest. What impressed me in tokyo disneyland was how extremely clean was everywhere."
3184,5,10-Sep,United States,Plenty of Disney Magic - plus great people watching,"Visited Tokyo Disneyland and Disney Sea over 3 days in late September. Had a brilliant time. The rides have all the typical Disney magic you would find in Orlando and the people are fun to watch (people in matching Disney outfits, big groups with mouse ears and Mickey gloves - has to be seen to be beleived). The Disney Halloween celebrations (Parades, shows) had kicked off already and those were as good as the rides. Overall if you love Disney parks you'll love this one. Just be sure to go mid-week to avoid crowds. The only negative we found at all was that the food was a bit off our tastes. You either have Western junk food or it seems you get stuff smothered in Teriyaki sauce."
3185,1,10-Dec,Australia,Don't bother. A waste of money.,Crowds were appalling. On average a 2-3hour wait for each ride. No fastpasses available. Children only went on 4 rides all day. (9am - 10pm). Very expensive. Very little inside seating for dinner. Children also do not rate this as a highlight of their trip. (Ages 9 and 10).
3186,5,10-Dec,Australia,"Great day with kids, week day, not school holidays!!!!","Our family of 2 Adults and 3 children between 11-15yrs thoroughly enjoyed our day at Tokyo Disneyland.  We are not fanatical about Disney stuff but had thought it was worth it for our three kids.  We got there at about 9am after catching a JR train easily (ask your accomodation) which took us directly to Tokyo Disneyland.  We had pre-purchased tickets so didn't have to queue to buy.  (We purchased our tickets at Takashimaya in Shibuya)WEEKDAYS ONLY!Firstly I would say (and I think other reviews support this) do not go on a weekend or during Japan's school holidays and expect an easy day of this theme park.  We went on a week day during winter before school holidays and waited between 5min and 40mins for rides which we were very happy with.RIDESThundermountain and Spacemountain were the kids favorites, Poohbear's hunny hunt and Splash mountain were also good although the poohbear ride is obviously for younger children.  Get your brochure when you go in and look for the rides which have fast passes and plan your day.  We had a good hour out for lunch and still managed to get on Thundermountain and Spacemountain twice!  I wouldn't advise doing the evening pass, you need a day to do everything without stress. The haunted house was themed with Tim Burton's nightmare before Xmas which we enjoyed but apparently the attraction changes from time to time and is not always as good. I wouldn't bother with Star Wars or unless you have time, it's not a genuine ride and uses old technology but it was mildly entertaining.FAST PASSESCheck the website or your brochure for fast pass rides.  They are free of charge unlike Universal Studios.  The staff will show you how to use them by inserting your passport ticket into the fast pass machine to redeem the fast pass at the attraction of your choice.  Not a 100% sure but I think the fast passes are valid after 3pm but cannot be redeemed after 3pm.  Check with staff on these times, there are some english speakers who can advise you.FOODWe bought onigiri (rice balls) in a cooler bag for the morning which are very cheap to buy from the local stores.  For lunch we ate at the buffet restaurant which cost us about $20 a head. Not the cheapest I admit but we were unlikely to be back with the kids in the near future.  It wasn't a bad western style feed with a smattering of japanese, we left with full tummy's.  My husband loved the churros, which are available near spash mountain and other spots which were clearly marked on the brochure map.SOUVENIRSThere are a ton of souvenir shops, many with the same stuff as the previous one.  We bought lots of little gifts and even though it was coming up to Xmas, there were many items discounted, on special or on clearance - look out for these as there were some good bargains on quality items.PHOTOSThere are rules about tripods - you aren't allowed to take them.  This made taking family photos a bit hard.  I noticed some of the asian tourists (not sure which nationality) brought mini tripods which I probably would have risked if I had one.PARADESThe parades were fun and colourful, little kids would just love them.  Be aware that if you are trying to get to a ride the parades can divert you so check the times and plan ahead, so you don't miss out on a ride or miss a fast pass time.TOILETSClean western style, but busy even on a good day.  We didn't encounter Japanese style but had heard from others that some were Japanese style.Overall I would recommend Tokyo Disneyland to those who love Disney or have kids, just don't expect a great experience if you go during peak periods. Enjoy!"
3187,4,N/A,Australia,Like I Imagined In My Childhood & So Much More,"PROS*********The atmosphere is brilliant, it's everything I imagined and so much more. You can act like a child and get away with it!The merchandise you can purchase in different locations, makes great gifts.Food - There are many places that cater to your needsMonorail - Buy an all day pass!Go during a special occasion - I really felt the Christmas spirit when I was in D.L.Cirque De Soliel shows.CONS**********You have to wait a very long time for rides. Fast passes are a great option - if you persist in asking the staff about this.Japanese staff seem to sometimes misunderstand what is being asked by an English speaking tourist - bring a translation guide. It helps!Constantly crowded - Everything is a wait or a shove or push. Don't be afraid to shove back sometimes! Some Japanese people are just rude and selfish. (Not all)Walking distance - not good for someone who is unable to manage long distances. It was exhausting for me. They need a golf cart or something."
3188,4,N/A,Malaysia,Tips from a 3rd-time visitor,"1) Suggest buying the tickets in advanced as tickets can be sold-out (esp on weekends/holidays). If staying in central Tokyo, most convenient place to buy them is at the Disney stores (Shibuya, Shinjuku, etc). You dont have to exchange the ticket before entering the park. I am not sure it's the same with buying from the main train stations2)If possible, get into the park before 9.30am to obtain the FastPass + to explore as much as you can.This is especially if you have only have 1 day to explore 3)There will be bag-check before entering the park. They are fine if you bring food & drinks. If you're on a budget, this move can save a lot4)Get the English park guide from the ticket counter/ticket attendant at the entrance. Once you're in the park, only Japanese version is available5)Suggest to skip The 'Captain EO' attraction as it was the MOST DISSAPOINTING attraction we have ever encountered in ANY theme park. It is just an old 3D movie with Michael Jackson in it, and would have been impressive in the '80s. But for 2010, it's just awful. The Shrek 4D attraction in HK Disneyland should be the benchmark and this was way below it. NOT worth your time queing and watching AT ALL6)Basic thing to know about FastPass is that you can only take 1 FastPass every 2 hours. The FastPass tends to finish by about 3-4pm, hence the reason you should come early to the park to get hold as much passes as you can7)If you're thinking of getting on the Splash Mountain, just be prepared to get your upper body wet.You wont be badly drenched (as far as my encounter goes)8)They are several parades during the day and just 1 during night. Reccomend to watch 1 of the day parades and must watch the night one. If you're not so into parades, you can actually watch it while queing up for certain attractions (where the queue is outside)9) On that note, most of the rides' waiting time are dramatically reduced when the parades are in session. So if you dont want to wait long for the ride, just wait for the parade. But make sure you reach the ride abt 15mins before parade starts as they'll close the walkaways 10)If you're travelling with a child and a stroller, suggest to differentiate your stroller than others (tie up a scarf,etc.) because there are a LOT of strollers parked outside the rides. Even more so if you'll be renting the park's stroller11)If you're visiting only for 1 day, just expect that you wont be able to go on every attraction. So like others, attack the main rides firstThis has been my 3rd visit and hope others find these tips useful. Essentially, it is not a 'starter' Disneyland such as HK's, and most of the rides are well-worth your time queing. The place still has got its magic and is a must-visit."
3189,4,N/A,United States,Tokyo Disneyland Tips!,"Needless to say Tokyo Disneyland is wonderful.  Rather than bore you with what we did I'll provide some tips under ""If I returned to Tokyo Disneyland I would ...""1) Get all the best rides out of the way first.  Depending on your taste when entering (assuming you get there when they first open) RUN to your favorite ride.  We should have ran to Splash Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain first.  We waited about 1 hour in line for Big Thunder Mountain and didn't even get a chance to go on Splash Mountain.  This place gets CROWDED even during a chilly November day.  Obviously if you have little ones who want to see one of the Disney characters then this ain't goin happen!  Instead RUN to Mickey Mouse!2) Use the FastPass wisely.  We got lucky for a second ride on Big Thunder Mountain.  But chose poorly for Splash Mountain which ended up being a time slot right before we were going to leave.  You can only use FastPass during a given period of time.  Then after an hour or so you can get another FastPass ticket for another ride.  It gets confusing.  If you're not familiar with FastPass then read up on it.  It is a MUST for all rides that use it.3) Get a good idea of what restaurants serve.  We had a VERY fussy teenager looking for basic pasta and none of the restaurants served it with the exception of the pricey buffet restaurant.  While we were salivating over all the choices we came across we had to wander the land for plain spaghetti!  Boring. 4) Pay attention to when the parades take place.  When the parades started there were masses of people gathering around the street.  If we planned on this we could have avoided being stuck in an area we didn't want to be in.  Overall Tokyo Disneyland is a nice attraction to visit if your looking for something different from the usual Japanese shrine or park visits.  It's very clean and friendly.  If you don't understand Japanese that's fine.  It was great fun to hear the Japanese cultural interpretation of something that is quintessentially American.  They did a spectacular job!"
3190,5,N/A,United Kingdom,Super wonderful,"Spent a very magical day here in November. The weather was not great - bit drizzly and cold most of the day, but this kept the crowds away we think! The park had been transformed for Christmas and this really added a touch more magic. The magnificent Christmas tree in the World Bazarr upon entering the park is wonderful.Some of the lands and theming is similar to other Disneylands but there are some other big differences. The staff are so polite and professional and the park is kept absolutely immaculately clean and obviously well maintained. Everyone seems determined, in a good way, that you have a great day. Also, the food courts do pretty good value food and it is refreshing that it is not a total rip-off like some other theme parks.Many Japanese people that come to Disney (and we have lots of Japanese friends!) are very into Disney and their priorities are generally meeting a character, Pooh's Hunny Hunt and the parades, therefore the crowds for these are very large and sometimes the other rides are not actually too busy. We did not have to queue for more than 30 mins for anything, and mainly nothing was more that 15 mins.The newest attraction is Monsters Inc, hide and go Seek ride. This is a sort of variation on the Buzz Lightyear Astro Blaster ride, but is still well done and very cute for kids. We enjoyed it but you might not want to queue that long for it. It was very popular when we were there so we queued for that whilst grasping a fastpass for Captain EO, which has been rejuvinated following MJ's death. Incredibly cheesy and dated it was fab fun!Highlights for us were Splash Mountain - brilliant!, It's Small World themed for Christmas so all the little people were singing Jingle Bells too!, the Haunted Mansion also re-themed into A Nightmare for Christmas, and Star Tours, an oldie but a goodie!Overall it was a great day, very magical and well worth a visit. There are fireworks at 8.30pm if you can brave the cold!"
3191,5,N/A,Australia,Amazing fun for the whole family here!,"It was really cold when we went in late Autumn, but light on crowds so the longest wait time was less than one hour.  Hubby and I and the kids all had an awesome time here and stayed for the night lights parade.  Definitely worth the wait - even the Disney princess dresses were lit up!Most of the attractions were open and you can take a ticket and come back later on selected rides to save wait time.We were disappointed not to see the Fairytale castle open, but everything else was available.  Space Mtn, Pooh Bear rides and the classic tea-cup and It's a Small Wall rides were good.  Not as expensive as we'd expected either."
3192,3,N/A,Malaysia,"Very Well Done and Fun, but overcrowded...","Me and my wife is a VERY huge Disneyland fan. We'd visited 3 Disneylands in 3 years time (Paris, Hong Kong and the latest is Tokyo). Being a huge fan, we were looking very forward to our visit to Tokyo Disneyland! On the day when we were supposed to visit the park (we booked our tickets in advance), we were anxious and arrived an hour earlier (8am) before the park opens to make sure we will be the very 1st ones to enter the park. We were surprised when we arrived, that there's already a HUGE crowd lining up at the entrance (about 100m long queue on ALL gates!). We were like... ""are we already late?"". We wondered how early the person in the first queue arrived.Well, we thought the crowd were just as anxious as us and we lined up. Time passed and it was 9am! The gates opened, and we could see people running and rushing in the after entering the park. When its our turn to enter the park, we could feel the 'magical' feeling that we always have when we are in Disneyland. But soon and sadly, the feeling faded... we were seriously sickened by the crowd (95% japanese). EVERYTHING that we wanted to do, we had to queue for it! Even just taking a photo of a Christmas Tree!! I mean, its good that everyone lined up, but its just insane to be lining up just for a shot of a christmas tree! EVERYTHING involves queueing in the land! And what made us sick is that, the Japanese would open up plastic sheets and queue up for a performance THREE HOURS(thats 180 minutes) before the show starts! Not just one or two, but a WHOLE BUNCH of them! We tried arriving one hour earlier for a show, but guess what? it says FULL. WHAT?! So, does that mean we have to waste our precious time and queue for hours with those 'picknickers' to get ourselves a place in for the show? And the worst is, the Disney Staff would actually assist them in queueing!! It's just too insane Fastpasses would sold out in just an hour after the park opens and without fastpass, one have to queue for like 120 minutes for a ride! No Joke!We felt that Tokyo Disneyland had been over runned by the Japanese and they just had ripped off the magical feeling from it. No wonder we dun spot much tourist in the land. Very sad to say this but, we thought it has become more like a typical 'Japanese Theme Park'. Everything in the park is catered for the Japs. The shows, design, details and rides were up to the Disney standard though. It's just the crowd and the management s*cked big time.Overall, we enjoyed 'Disneyland and Disneysea', but not the crowd, people, management and the 'japanese disney culture'. If you were to spend just a day in the park, be prepared to miss a whole lot of attractions and shows. We got the 3 days ticket and saw all the shows and most of the rides in the nick of time. Most of time would be wasted lining and queueing up. The park itself is very well done though and we were really impressed with it, but again, the crowd and management is a disappointment and mood killer."
3193,2,N/A,Australia,Overcrowded,All the rides where there but the waiting times were unbelievable. 60-90 minutes wait for the main attractions. The Disney fast pass system seemed to make it worse as people flowed through as we waitedin the line. You can only get one fast pass at a time and even then you had to wait upt to 4 hours to use it. Not the happiest place on earth! Disney Sea was a little better but we waited 75 minutes for the Tower of Terror afterbeing told the wait was 50 minutes and the ride seemed to be over very quickly.
3194,4,N/A,New Zealand,Huge queues but still worth it,"I took my two boys age 8 and 6 on a very hot (37 degrees) Friday in August.  We arrived early - about an hour before the park opened and the queues were amazing so took about an hour and 15 mins to get into the park.  I had read previous reviews on TripAdvisor so came prepared with exactly which rides we didn't want to miss.  I smuggled heaps of snacks into the park and large bottles of Pocari Sweat (electrolyte drink) which we definitely needed to get through the day.  Headed straight for a Fast-pass to Space Mountain and got one in about ten minutes so the ride was booked for about an hour an half later, then queued for the Michael Jackson ride - for 80 minutes.  Boys complained that they hadn't seen anything and had been in the park for 2 hours but when they came out of the ride they said that the queueing was definetly worth it.  Whew.  Then we got straight through Space Mountain with our FastPass.  Between 10.15am and 4 pm we managed 6 rides - the others being Pirates of the Carribean, Haunted Mansion, Peter Pan and the Disney Show.  Ate Mickey Mouse shaped ice-blocks, and same shaped chocoalate waffles.  Didn't really see any characters up close except for the 7 dwarfs. The park staff were friendly and the place beautiful and clean - magic atmosphere.  Bought toys on the way out at 4pm so all ended up satisfied with our day."
3195,5,N/A,United States,The ABSOLUTE best!!,"Living in California, our home park of course is the ""original"" Disneyland.     We have been to Disney World and the Disney Cruise,     Tokyo Disney is my FAVORITE park out of them all so far.   The park was always SPOTLESS, the employees were BEYOND friendly and they were always smiling.    I fell in love with this park, the people,  and the country.   I cant wait to return."
3196,5,N/A,Australia,Fun for all ages! Simply amazing!,"Tokyo Disneyland was the main focus of our trip to Japan. From the Gold Coast, Australia, home of Sea World, Movie World and Dreamworld, we were keen to visit Disneyland and find out for ourselves what it's like to be in the 'happiest kingdom of them all'. From Narita airport, the express bus (air-conditioned and comfy) it took just about an hour to arrive at Disney main gates. The first thing you see is the amazing Disneyland Hotel, and a huge area for the entrance of the park, gardens, walkways, monorail lines above, and the bus terminal constantly busy. Stepping from the bus the cameras were out again to take in as much as we could before we even got to the ticket booths! After making our way to the ticket booth and paying 5100y each for a senior passport entry, another long walk up to Disney Main Street, as you approach it, you can see Cinderella Castle in the distance and just how wonderful this place is.We came across Winnie The Pooh greeting visitors and playing up to the crowd before getting to Main Street, which is fully covered, and gift and souvenir and food shops on both sides of the street. A very big crowd even in this area, and the gift shops were busy but we strolled in and out of them all without any trouble...TIP: best to do your souvenir shopping before the 'Jubilation' parade, we found after the parade it was almost impossible to get into the shops as the crowds from the parade are all assembled close to Main Street and directly go to the shops after the parade.You have everything you expect from Disney around the park: Fantasyland - Peter Pan's flight, Snow White's adventures, Pinocchios Daring Journey, the amazing Castle carousel and Haunted Mansion. Tomorrowland - Monsters Inc, Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyears AeroBlasters and Grand Circuit Raceway. Adventure Land - Pirates Of The Carribean, Jungle Cruise, Western River Railroad. Toontown - Roger Rabbit's Car Toon  Spin,Minnie's House, Chip 'n' Dale's Treehouse. Donald's Boat, Goofy's Bouncehouse and Toon Park. Westernland - Mark Twain Riverboat, Big Thunder Mountain, Country Bear Theatre. Critter Country - Splash Mountain, Beaver Brothers Explorer Canoes.My wife and I are 'mature'  and weren't looking to go on rides, so the long lines did not bother us. We enjoyed checking out the gift and souvenir shops.Very hot and humid, but found the cold drinks reasonable, and spending yen is not like spending 'dollars'!  There are also mobile carts with popcorn etc around various locations of the park. As soon as you see a long queue it's worth finding out what it's for, you really don't want to miss something special.Despite the hot conditions we managed to get around almost all of the park, Tomorrowland area we did not see much of, however, the summer splash musical ,'Cool The Heat' performed on the forecourt of Cinderella Castle with lots of water into crowds was fun and well done. Slightly damp, but felt good after the show, I wondered why people around me had their camera's wrapped in plastic and had towels over them!! I soon found out why! Didn't expect so much water! This is Disney's summer promotion and not an all year round show. Well suited to the hot conditions.The crowd started sitting in all sorts of place's along the pathways, we asked why? for the 'Jubilation' parade!...at 4pm...they were taking their seats at 3pm! It was good they sat on the ground, every one had good views, and those like us working three cameras!!at same time...did not get any heads, or distractions. Very well organised as is all of Disneyland, even the cleaners looked like they enjoyed their jobs, as they probably would. The parade came and went in about 20 minutes...and was amazing, the floats unbeleivable and the stars were all there, dancers, and great music. The park is open till late and has some night shows as well. After a busy and entertaining day it was time to head of towards the bus terminal to connect with our bus back to Narita (where we were staying at the International Garden Hotel) at 6.05pm, pay at the airport when you arrive 2400y pp...this is the last bus to go back to Narita each day...but there's always the trains that run continuously from Maihama station, depending where you need to go of course!Pros: the heat...nothing much you can do about that! 39d celsius in Tokyo is hot.Not being able to get Disney baseball caps for souvenirs or even T shirts with TDL, and to try and get envelopes with Disney on for sending postcards (which were all cartoon only and none with Disneyland itself on them)..was impossible, no one understood, and everything I thought was a pack of envelopes...was something else!We are already planning a return trip, we just loved it, loved Japan, the people, the cleanliness and our memories of Disneyland and Disney Sea, which is the other Disney park. Two seperate Disney parks, both very different in approach, Disney Sea offers a trip through different continents, has an amazing Chip 'n' Dale water show, cool service ""Deluxe' features Minnie and Goofy.  DisneySea sells the same souvenirs as Disneyland. Places to sit and relax and eat. Try the pastries store to your right just inside the main entrance...heaven! Take the monrail, thats a cool experience. Park guides are available in English and most signs are easy to read. Overall, fantastic Disney, fabulous parks, and maybe better than anything anywhere in the world. Compared to the Gold Coast theme parks, while they are very excellent in their own way, nothing compares to Disney."
3197,5,N/A,China,best experiance!!!,"we loved disneyland and disney sea!!! so we spending 5 days for both theme park while we are in japan. and we love it every minute of it. great food great ride and great overall experience. disneyland is more appealing to the younger children since a lot of the rides is very suitable for children. make sure when you come not the day when students come with their schools to avoid long wait. and take fast pass when ever you can. my fav  ride is indiana jones and my brother 8 years old  and my husband is the buzz light year my mom is the space mountain. and you must watch the parade when we come is Easter parade which is so fun!!! best food is on tommorowland i think they have great pizza and the chicken buns is really tasty. oh yeah there's special dinner show at night , we go to the goofy one and is really great show  even though the food is just so so , we got the best seats since we reserve 1 month ahead( you should reserve at least 1 day before). my suggestion is to stay at tokyo disneyland hotel or miracosta to get the best experience so you don't need to worried about subway time and if you are tired you can rest at the hotel and went back again at the same day. my suggestion is to take at least 2 days for both park. this is the place that i will definitely come back for more !!!"
3198,5,N/A,N/A,"Plan ahead, be organised and have an amazing day at the happiest place on earth","This was the first Disneyland I have been to. As we had heard good things about the night parade we decided to get there around noon and stay right until close. We went on a hot Thursday in mid-July and did not find it very busy. I think the heat kept some locals away but being from australia we are used to doing things outside in hot weather. My main advice for anyone is to PLAN AHEAD. Get a map either before you get there or as you are on the disney train and prioritise your day. Pick 3 or 4 popular rides you really, really want to go on and arrange your day around these. The most important thing about the fast passes is you want to get as many as you can (aim for 3 or 4) so make sure you collect your next fast pass the minute it is available and THEN go on a ride. For example, if your fast pass for a ride allows you to enter it between 2pm and 3pm, and your next fast pass will be available at 2.10pm, make sure at 2.10pm you are collecting your next fast pass and THEN go to your fast pass ride for your previous fast pass. Trust me, fast passes will save you loads of time.Space Mountain was by far the best ride I went on all day - absolutely terrifying. We used a fast pass for Space Mountain and then immediately lined up in the general queue to go on it again it was that good. The general queue mid afternoon was only a 30 minute wait.If it is hot weather and you plan on being there all day its important to stop and have a proper rest. We did this during the 4pm parade, sat in the shade and just waited then watched for an hour. A great way to build up some energy for the rest of the day.You are not going to be able to see and do everything hence planning and only picking the essential things. Mix your day up with popular big rides (by use of fast passes) and then going on smaller, quicker rides while you wait to use fast passes.Keep in mind that the entire park basically stops for the parades so if you are not interested in these its a good time to gop on a ride as there will be far less people.I guess we were lucky with the crowds - the Star Wars and Pirates of the Carribean ride did not have any queues at all.The highlight of the day was undoubtebly the night-time parade. I wont give too much away but as a 26 year old I thought it was incredible - MUCH better than the daytime parade. Again, the park stops for it so plan your fast passes around it. Splash Mountain was great fun to go on at night.It was a fantastic day out, yes there are thousands of people and its a fair distance from tokyo but plan your day, dont be foolish and go on a weekend and you will be able to do everything you want. The staff are fantastic and it really the happiest place in the world."
3199,5,N/A,China,Still the happiest place in the world,"I took my family to Tokyo Disneyland during the second week of July 2010. After reading the reviews here I noted the fact that most of the people who did not enjoy themselves at Tokyo Disneyland went on the wrong days when the park was packed with people and they had to queue for hours for the rides. Therefore I took all the necessary precautions to avoid the crowds - we went on weekdays (Tuesday and Wednesday), avoided the Japanese school holidays and went during the off peak season. The result was we were still met with some big crowds but the queues were manageable. In fact, we were surprised that some of the major rides like Pirates of the Carribean, the Haunted Mansion and Star Tours had no lines at all and we were able to go again and again. The longest we had to wait was about 30 minutes for Monsters Inc. We wanted to get the fastpass for this but they were gone by the time we got there at 1pm. Evidently this is a new attraction and all the Japanese wanted to see it. We decided to wait it out and it was worth it (a must do). We also waited about 20 minutes for the roller coaster at Big Thunder Mountain and then we used the fastpass twice to cut the queues.We also used the fastpass twice for Buzz Lightyear. All the other rides did not have much of a queue. I would say that if you go during a day with relatively low traffic and make judicious use of the fastpass then you can avoid the crowds and have a great time.We had originally planned to spend 2 days at Disneysea and one day at Disneyland. However, the kids loved Disneyland so much more than Disneysea that we had to spend a second days at Disneyland instead. There was just so much to do for the kids and it cannot all be done in one day.The only letdown was the shows at Disneyland do not have the same Broadway style quality as the ones at Hong Kong Disneyland, where we have been many times. However the entire park is so much bigger, more exciting and prettier than Hong Kong Disneyland.This was definitely the highlight of our trip to Tokyo."
3200,4,N/A,Australia,Fun Fun Fun,"We went to DisneySea on a Tuesday and Disneyland the following day using a two day pass.  Going mid-week, in summer and not during school holidays was fantastic as there were very few people there on the days we went.  When I say very few the longest wait we had on a line was 20 mins for the Tower of Terror.  For a park that caters for 2 hour plus waiting periods this is fantastic. The Fast Pass system is great and allows you to do other stuff while you are waiting for a ride, but we only used it once for Space Mountain (fantastic ride!). The locals really get into the spirit of Disney too and we found ourselves swept us in Disneymania with the ears, popcorn bucket, coin purse etc....Great fun.  Highly recommend Temple of Doom and Space Mountain."
3201,5,N/A,Canada,Great amusement park!,"Been to California's DisneyLand before, but I think I liked Tokyo's a lot better! Everyone got into the spirit of things wearing the various hats and ears and little coin purses. They also had an Easter/Spring theme going on whilst we were there, which was very cool as all the gardens, statues and archways were all ""prettied up"" with flowers and bright colours.It was very busy on the day that we went, even though it was a Tuesday I think, but we got some of the Fast Passes and still managed to do a few cool rides. I was very impressed with the animatronics on the likes of the Pirates of the Caribbean/Haunted Mansion, etc. rides. They are quite different to what we have back home and VERY realistic!Got there at about 11am though and there was no queue to purchase tickets at all. Big big lines and crowds at the end of the day to do your shopping, so it's perhaps a better idea to do your shopping earlier in the day. Sales assistants are constantly re-stocking items as you browse so keep an eye on them if there's something that you might want!"
3202,4,N/A,Australia,Great family fun,"Tokyo Disneyland is just fantastic.  Its great family fare and is every bit as cheesey and American as it should be.  If you've been to the US Disneyland, then its the same thing.  Weirdly the same in fact.  Except the parade has like, Asian Cinderella.  Don't miss the parade - its GREAT!  Everyone really gets into the spirit with heaps of guests wondering around with Minnie ears or Tigger hats.  it really adds to the atmosphere.  If you're looking for a Japanese cultural experience...well this is the American version of it.  There were virtually no foreigners when we went though so, perhaps it really is Japanese-y!  Its a fun day so relax and pretend you're 10.Food for Westerners isnt really that great though I have to say.  We went in January and had no idea how COLD it would be.  Rug up.  Babies are well catered for with heaps of baby facilities for feeding, heating bottles, changing bub.Its very easy to get to on the subway which takes you right to the gate."
3203,4,N/A,United States,A Great Visit for Disney Lovers,"For those who love all things Disney this is a great visit.  A lot of familiar attraction, but a surprisingly large amount of new stuff.  Rides seem toned down from the U.S. and Paris versions, but fun none the less.  We had a great time and our 1-year old granddaughter was the hit of Tokyo."
3204,5,N/A,United States,My Lucky Day,"After reading reviews, I had prepared myself for long lines and very little riding, but that is not at all what I found.  On a Saturday in late April, I was able to experience all the major attractions Tokyo Disneyland had to offer, including Pooh's Hunny Hunt, the most popular ride in the park.  And I did it all without the use of FastPasses.  There was quite a long line at the entrance, but I arrived prior to opening and waited.  Once inside, the magic began.  For those from the U.S., Tokyo Disneyland blends elements of the original Disneyland in California with those from the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Florida and adds its own magic to create a wonderful theme park.  Cast members are friendly and helpful in spite of the language barrier.  I don't know if I happened to choose the slowest day of the year to visit, but I had a wonderful time."
3205,5,N/A,United States,My favourite Disneyland,"I've been to Tokyo Disney Resort (TDR) for 3 times and love it everytime. True the queues can be very long so it's important to do a little research as to which attraction to go for first or avoid, which to use FP and which to leave till the evening. Sometimes the excellent atmosphere in this park makes me forget about the Fast Pass. However, if you do remember it is an important time saver (you can get 1 person to queue for the fast pass (together with all passes) while you queue for entrance to another attraction.I never really have to queue for entrance to the park as I always stay at the official hotels (which sells the passes too) and has a seperate entrance.I've been to California's and Paris' Disneyland but TDR wins hands down for almost everything. It's very well maintained, staff are fantastic, and very importantly the atmosphere is great here. I try to go on low season, weekdays but queues for very popular rides can still be 1 1/4hr. I'm kind of on leisure pace so 1 day is not quite enough for Disneyland. 1 day in DisneySea works fine for me."
3206,4,N/A,Australia,Disney Shopping,"I was told about the long queues that I would experience in Disneyland, but I didn‚Äôt experience that. We arrive at Tokyo Disneyland at around 11am no queues to get in. We did mostly shopping, there were lines to take photos with the characters but it was only about a 10 minute wait.In comparison to Hong Kong Disneyland, Tokyo Disneyland is so much better. However, the fire works show at night needs a bit of an improvement, it was very short."
3207,3,N/A,Australia,Could be renamed Disneyqueue,"I had read the other reviews for Disney and thought they had visited during holidays. Wrong, we went outside of school holidays and could hardly believe the queues. We arrived at 915 for 930 open and there  was10's of 000's of people already there. After a 40 minute wait to get in, the people were running past us to get into queues for rides and fast passes.You even have to queue to  get a photo with any mascots (stitch pook bear etc). The fast past idea seems good,get a ticket for a ride time later in the day and avoid queueing. Wrong the queue for fast pass was as long as the rides(I managed to skip the massive line to get a past) and by the time you get to the front they are booking time slots into the night. Even with fastpass the line was a 30 min wait.We were staying at the resort and planned 3 days at Disney, and although it was a nice day once was enough. There were simpoly too many people for the rides.We returned at night for the parade and I noticed the lines were shorter until 5 mins before the end when people were off running again.Don't go here for a day trip, it is too much. The hotels are excellent and it makes the queues tolerable when you can duck home for a rest. The ikspari (Ithink) mall was excellent for shopping and dining. Good luck, I hope you get a quiet day!!!(the bus carpark was empty the day we were there it looked bigger than the carpark at movieworld!!"
3208,3,N/A,Malaysia,TOO LONG QUEUE,"Visited both Disneyland and Disneysea during mid March and found the queues were just outrageous.  Being to Disney attractions in US and Europe, we were amazed by the long queues, Some needed above 200 minutes queing time.   The Japanese are such patient people, even their young people,  Other than attractions and rides, they also queued at the entrance way before openning,  popcorn kiosk, hotdog kiosk, restaurants table and etc..  There is no way to enjoy all the rides in one day.  Best bet is to reserve 3-4 days to visit both parks.  Even thought, we do not understand Japanese, the parks are highlights in our trip.  Both parks are well maintained, clean, have beautiful landscaping, and have friendly service personnel."
3209,1,N/A,United Kingdom,"3+ hour queues  - great if you really like queuing, rubbish otherwise","My family and myself visited Disney Tokyo today as part of a trip to Japan over the next two weeks from the UK. We were all very much looking forward to our first ever day at Disney and my three children were very excited. We arrived at 10.30am after a long journey across the city and paid our entrance fee which is not inconsiderable (~ 25,500 Yen ~¬£180!!) and went into the park. We were told two of the main rides were not in action but thought there would be plenty of other attractions and rides to entertain us otherwise. What we found however were very few rides and at those mammoth queues with waiting times up to 3 hours and fourty minutes according to the Disney staff. We were told all the fast track slots had all been taken before we arrived at the park. The park was heaving and even walking along the paths was difficult as people had to sit down on them as there was a shortage of seating (which became much worse at lunch time). We eventually only managed 2 rides (waiting nearly 5 hours in total) but couldn't face waiting up to three hours for another 10 minute ride even though the two we went on were great. We did watch the parades which were excellent but we went home early (the wind was high and we thought the fireworks were probably going to be cancelled) feeling very dissapointed and I feel that this was less than a satisfactory experience and none of us had the 'radiant smiles' your publicity enertains. The only other thing to do was spend even more money in the huge numbers of shops and snack bars.We really went wanting to have a good time but there were far too many people in the park with too few rides available and we came out less than impressed.We've been to all the big theme parks in the UK and they are all miles better than this. My advice is think very carefully before parting with your hard earned cash here."
3210,1,N/A,N/A,A nightmare unless you like to queue for 2 hours for everything,"We went there on a Thursday in end-Feb 2010. Not a special day at all, no reason to be crowded, but it was! Although we paid a small fortune (5800 yen each) we simply didn't get to do any of the main attractions either because they were closed (simply unacceptable!) or because you had to queue for minimum 2 hours in the cold!! We happened to have a baby, so we soon discovered that we couldn't do any of the ""red star"" attractions (ie 95%), not even the merry-go-round with horses! Even to eat a (very bad) sandwich, we had to queue for 30 minutes ouside, and seat... outside in the cold! Can't believe we paid for this crap. If we wanted to queue, we had to leave the stroller at the entrance, which means queuing for 2 hours carrying a 10 kg baby in our arms. Are they mad? This is supposed to be a place for kids!There were just so many people everywhere, it was awful. Nothing compared with US or Paris Disneyland. No-one could speak english either. Only Japanese!The worse of it was when I tried to find the customer center to give a feedback... took me ages to find a place called ""the House"", where no-one spoke english but they eventually gave me a ""Customer Comments"" form on which I wrote basically the same review and asked for a feedback from them to be semt to my home address. The guy said he needed to speak to his supervisor and finally came back saying his supervisor didn't want to give me any feedback or send any mail. And then he bowed and said ""sorry"". Where is the American Disney service? They couln't care less. We ended up paying for the worse day in our trip to Japan. The only attraction they offer is to shop in one of their (many) stores... Don't go."
3211,5,N/A,Japan,Exploring the new world,"One day is not enough to take it all. The atmosphere of happiness together with the Japanese level of service and quality make the Disney resort really fantastic. I cannot say I'm keen on the children entertainment, but this is really worth visiting.First, the park is really big and every attraction in it is really captivating. In every corner you find something unusual. Time from the very opening up to the darkness when the bright lights start sparkling everywhere - it all flies away as it happened in a minute.Then - sure this is the heaven for children of almost all ages (up to 100). The Japanese really know how to entertain:)Queues - yes they are. But escape weekends and be prepared: if the place is really cool, it might be overcrowded. Personally I hate crowds, but in Disneyland this is not the same. Everybody is so happy that the atmosphere overweighs the worldwidewait:)"
3212,5,N/A,United States,Fun Break From Tokyo Museums and Sights,"Tokyo DisneyLand and DisneySea are fun breaks from touring museums and seeing the sights in Tokyo. Visited DisneyLand at Christmastime, highly recommended. DisneySea is unique, found only in Tokyo, and worth a day while you're in Japan, particularly if you're a Disney parks fan or if you have children with you, but I'd recommend it even if you're a party of adults (we were parents traveling with out two twentysomething kids, and we all had a great time).  And if you like Cirque du Soleil, the Tokyo show, ZED, on the Disney campus, is unique in the world, and we all thought it one of the best, perhaps the best, of the Cirque shows we've seen."
3213,5,N/A,Singapore,Tokyo Disney Resort - monster queues,"I‚Äôve never queued so much before in my life‚Ä¶until I got to Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea. If queuing was an Olympic sport, I would have been a Gold medalist.3 hours 20 minute for the new Monster Inc ride. I thought I‚Äôd have to tell my son that he will be a deceased old man by the time he gets on the actual ride. The ride was not worth it. Not worth it at all. What gets me is, I waited in line for 200 minutes to do this.There are queues to buy popcorn. Queues for every ride and attractions. Queues to even get into the park. Seriously, I queued for 1 hour 20 minutes just to get into the park in the morning. Half the population of Tokyo must be here. I was told by a friend that we have to be smart to pick the best time to go to Disney resort in Tokyo. I think the best time is 1962.Not that I am complaining.  You can‚Äôt have a bad time at Disney resort.Everywhere, cheerful uniformed employees will offer you any information about the park, such as where the rides are, where the popcorn kiosks are and where the restrooms are. The food are actually pretty good, and we tried Captain Hook‚Äôs galley, Cape Cod Cook Off, Center Street Coffeehouse, Great American Waffle company and Restaurant Sakura. The Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull ride was awesome as was the night illumination parade.Disney is still truly The Magic Kingdom, even in this age of Playstation and WII"
3214,3,N/A,Philippines,Expect long queue lines for the rides.,"I went to Tokyo Disneyland with my family  on  a weekday, December 2009. Its winter time, the temperature is 7 degrees. The park was full of people and there were long lines to get to any of the rides. It took us 1 hour waiting for our turn for the Monsters Inc. attraction. It was the same, even longer,  for the other rides. It was really very populated when we visited and i wished we got the Express Ticket. This park is bigger than Hong Kong Disneyland. Since the park lay-out  for all Disneyland resorts is quite the same, if you are familiar with one Disneyland lay-out, you'll get through with any of the Disneyland parks in the world. We  didn't have any problem on our way to try the different attractions and shops this Disney resort has to offer. The last attraction was the Sparkling parade. I was surprised that it was common for the park visitors  to bring along blankets and picnic mats. All these people looked like having picnic on the sides of the main street while waiting for the parade. The parade was enjoyable, my son was so happy to see Sully and Boo, and the rest of the Disney characters  wrapped in colorful moving lights. The experience was fun, even though it rained few minutes before the parade is finished."
3215,5,N/A,Israel,This beautiful place is a dream come true...,"Believe it or not, but I have visited Tokyo DisneyLand and DisneySea for no less than FIVE days on the same vacation. And still, I would be happy to come back for more. The whole atmosphere is simply enchanting- the music, the scenery, the shops, the beautiful parades... I visited there a few days before Halloween 2009, so everything was Halloween themed and the decorations were great. This time of year they're preparing for Christmas, so it should be even better...Anyway, Tokyo Disneyland is a great attraction, with or without children. The parks and rides are designed for a variety of ages, and I'm sure nobody can stay there without a big happy smile on their face! =D"
3216,5,N/A,Australia,The happiest place in Tokyo,"We spent approx 12 hours at Tokyo Disneyland recently and tried most of the adult rides. Most rides had long queues (it was a Sunday), however the fast pass system worked well. In a couple of instances we queued for the Fast Pass rides and found that the wait time was well below the advertised time frame (eg. the new monsters Inc Ride was advertised at 100 mins, however only took us 30 mins to get through). Splash Mountain & the Pirates of the Carribean rides were great. The Haunted House was very average. Note that the queues for sit-down restaurants are long during lunchtime & at breakfast. Would reccomend you eat early, or eat later by trying the many flavours of popcorn on offer throughout the park. If you ar eplanning on a good seat for the parades, note that most of hte good spots are taken over 90 mins before the start of the parade. Keep an eye on staff who will show you to the right spots. Only downers were that its a small world was closed & we only saw about 3 disney characters all day. Note also that a lot of the gift items available throughout the part are not available at the shop at the front door. If you are arriving by Metro from Tokyo Station- the platform is a significant distance away from other main platforms. You will need to allow at least 10 mins walk time through the station."
3217,5,N/A,United States,Better than Disneyland in California,"We only had one day to visit Disneyland, but what a day! It's laid out in a similar fashion to the one in Anaheim but with some changes (like the Haunted Mansion isn't in the New Orleans Square area). The park is newer and everything seems better, brighter, etc. Snow White's Castle, in the center of the park, is way cooler looking than the California one, too.Even though we spoke very, very little Japanese and most of the people working in the park speak very little English, it was very easy to get around, buy food and gifts, etc. My whole family really enjoyed the day. Just wish we could've stayed another day to go to Disney Sea.Also, it was very easy to get to by train. They practically have their own stop at Maihama on the Keiyo Line."
3218,1,N/A,Australia,dont bother unless you like queuing for 2 or 3 hours,After spending $500 on tickets for both Disneyland and Disneysea we could not get on even one single ride.  An absolute rip-off.  At 10.30 on a Monday morning all rides were already 100 minutes plus waiting time - some fast passes were already finished and all others were not available until around 3.30 pm - we were only there for morning as we were flying out to Australia that afternoon.We left after one hour as there was no point in staying.I had 2 very disappointed boys (aged 9 & 14) and I was just totally incensed that they sell tickets for something you cant use.  Coming from Australia we didn't know any of this and would rather have stayed in Tokyo city looking at the beautiful sights.  NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!Even the popcorn had a queue of around 50 people.
3219,5,N/A,United States,What a fun Park!!,"We have now been to all the disney parks except in China.  We would rate the parks in Japan as outstanding.The Disneyland park was similar to all of the other Disneyland parks, but had it's own unique rides as well.  We went on a Thursday in July.  The crowd was not too bad.  We arrived right when they opened and followed the Japanese to get a fast pass for the mosters inc. ride and then headed to the Pooh ride.  A note about the rides in Tokyo that make them a little extra special:  Some of the queues were so amazing (like Pooh) that you didn't even mind waiting in line.Some of our favorite things:Winnie the Pooh rideJungle Cruise, even though we could not understand a single word,  the cast members were so funny at the loading area and on the boat.  It was the best jungle cruise ride ever!Big Thunder mountain. (Space mountain was being refurbished)Eating the very unique food.  We had fantastic desserts and even a chicken sandwich that came on a bun that looked like mickeys white glove.The characters were everywhere and the Japanese people just loved them.  It was very fun to watch.shopping.  The best and most unique gifts ever if you love all things disney!!!What a great time we had.  One day was not enough even though the crowds were low."
3220,5,N/A,United States,Magical Experience,"Went during Feb 09 with hubby for our honeymoon was amazing! We have been to the one in Orlando many times and they have same things this one had Tower of Terror and the one in Orlando had it at the Hollywood Studios. When we arrived they asked us if we needed English brochure and made sure we were taken care of. The food here was great, had their pizza and some kind of chocolate twist.We also ate at the buffet it was fabulous! I think it was around $27 per adult. It had noodles, rice but also chicken tenders and kids entrees, soup, salad, and desserts like cheesecake. Everyone in japan is unbelieveably FRIENDLY!!!! When u go into the 3D show they ask 'ARE U AMERICAN"" if u r then they have u go into another line. Don't worry its not them singling u out u just need a translator for the show. They are very helpful and I found that the characters there make more appearances through the park than even the one in Orlando.  Overall it was very busy at the park but things just seemed to run smoother there than the one in Orlando, the Japanese definately make your day, with how nice they are. The park is right next to Disneysea(other theme park), & there is the Disney hotel there and some kind of shopping mall with restaurants and a movie theatre. Make sure you have yen on you!"
3221,4,N/A,Spain,the best Disney,"i went with my wife in april, i really enjoyed too much, i am thinking to go back again"
3222,3,N/A,United Kingdom,Nice if you can get on a ride,"To visit here you need to be there when the gates open so that you can get on some of the popular rides. After 2pm it seemed that children from all over Tokyo came over and used their yearly passes and then they clogged up the system for the rides, making for example Splash Mountain a 2 hour wait!I was happy to have just visited this Disneyland as it is way bigger than the others I have visted, but disappointed because of the queues and feeling of being at a kindergarten.However, i think one fo the reasons for the long queues are that the ride operators unlike other parks, do not rush you onto and off the ride, plus there is also a lot of safety talk before you proceed. The fast past ticket machines were occupying space because hardly any of them worked. Their newest ride was Monsters Inc and that after 90 minutes of waiting was a let down. It is exactly like the Buzz Lightyear ride. They imagineers could have come up with something better.The one thing that i did like was the Main Parade and everyone was sitting down, so wherever you were, you had a good view. I find that the Japanese are very polite and sometimes reserved but definately not when it comes to having their picture taken with the characters. Those poor guys inside the costumes must be bruised all over the way people pull them to have their photo taken with them. As much as i liked the park, i prefer the one in California as this one seems more magical to me. Not tried Orlando yet."
3223,3,N/A,United Kingdom,What an experience,"We are glad that we visited Disneyland and Disneysea. We were however overwhelmed by the length of the queues and the queueing ettiquette or lack of it. It is not unusual to be physically pushed out of the way or have entire families push in infront of you. The queues were  a minimum of 1.5 hours per ride and it was not unusual for rides to go with empty seats so if you are only 2 people then make the staff aware incase you are able to queue jump.At Disneyland the queues for food were also very long, but at Disneysea this was not the case. Whilst the signs say that seats can not be reserved too far in advance for the Parade fom 5.30 onwards people were reserving places. The parade was impressive and you do not need to be on the front row to appreciate it."
3224,5,N/A,Australia,The 2nd happiest place on earth!,"Before arriving in tokyo, we decided to visit Tokyo disneyland at least once during our visit. as it turns out, we visited the park twice as one day in the park was just not enough! the metro ride to the park took approximately 30 minutes from Onmarion station (near the Tokyo Price Hotel, Minato area). the walk from the train station to the main gates of the park is a little long but was certainly worth the walk! On arrival, we were greeted at the gates by the Disney characters once we had made our way through the queues. You would be better off ariving at the park as early as possible and try and go in winter as the waiting lines are not as long. On day one we saw many attractions, went on several rides but mainly spent the day in awe of how great the park was! We had no issues with english speakers and all signage was in english. some of the rides however (Lilo & Stitch plus the Jungle Cruise) were all in Japanese but they were fun anyway. We did not get to see everything on the first day so went back for a second visit a few days later. Remember to wear good walking shoes and have a little patience as your visit to the park may be as ,long as hours (11 hours both times!). our second visit was grand and we managed to see loads of other attractions and go on some more rides on this day. the majority of the eating outlets are American based (hot dogs, soda and fries) and there is a great (and affordable) waffle shop on the left hand side of the main gates. overall, Tokyo Disneyland is a must see when visiting Tokyo and is certainly the 2nd happiest place on earth and worth the money!"
3225,5,N/A,India,Awesome Disney!,I have visited this Disneyland twice and both times it was an awesome experience..It's happy happy world with no frowns or sad faces :)Some lines are very long so it is advisable you plan your rides and take the fast passes in advance.. saves a lot on the waiting time..Must visit:1. Space Mountain2. Haunted house3. Cinderella Castle4. Pooh honey hunt5. 3D movie
3226,3,N/A,United States,Japanese language skills will make for a better visit,"As in most of Japan, English is not widely spoken, nor understood, at Tokyo Disneyland. MicroAdventure (in US parks known as Honey, I shrunk the Audience) was the only attraction that had the original English soundtrack available, but you must sit in the next to the last row for a headphone set. Chinese translation is also available in the same row. Pirates of the Caribbean has voiceover in Japanese at the start of the ride, but the animatronic characters audio is in English. Audio for most other rides is in Japanese only, including the Haunted Mansion and Star Tours. Many children visit the park after school, while still dressed in their school uniforms, but tend to leave by 9:00 PM or so. This park is best enjoyed if you have some Japanese language skills. Don't expect an American experience, but you can expect many of the same attractions as you find in the US parks and Euro Disney."
3227,2,N/A,Australia,Disappointed,"Just returned from Japan. Went to Disneyland Tokyo and was a little disappointed. The queues were sooooo looong (90 min wait for all of them). The fast track was closed for some reason. Unless you understood Japanese the bus tour was no help at all. The popcorn line was also very long and there were no decent adult souvenior t shirts or magnets to purchase. Maybe it was the day we went but there was so many people the shops were chaotic. The workers however were very pleasant, the parade was excellent and it really was a childrens paradise. (I felt like I needed to borrow a child for the day). It was a once in a lifetime experience for me, however I would only go to an english speaking disneyland again and with kids."
3228,5,N/A,United States,Happiest place on earth,"I went with my sister and 4-year-old niece.  We saw the Minnie Mouse Revue.  I wasn't expecting it to be all that entertaining for adults, but it was a very good production, spectacular costumes, good singing and dancing and drum corps, attractive ladies.  On the downside, there was no shade, and we strained to see over people's heads.The Winnie the Pooh Honey Hunt was also very good.  The cars you ride in are on rubber wheels, and they move in different paths from the other cars, with quick acceleration and braking, and they rotate to face the various scenes along the way.  Very cool!  My niece was a little scared in the dark part of the ride, though.All the staff and customers are happy and cheerful.  Lots of young ladies wearing their crazy outfits and all manner of Disney headwear - red ribbons, Minnie Mouse ears, etc.  Great people-watching.The parade was excellent.  And I liked the Halloween decorations."
3229,5,N/A,Australia,Best Disneyland in the World!,"This Disneyland contains all of the high end Disneyland attractions from all over the world. They have fastpasses for all the major rides.I suggest riding Splash Mountain, Space Mountain, BTM, Buzz Lightyear, Pooh's Hunny Hunt, Haunted Mansion, POTC etc.The really nice thing about the themepark is the guests themselves. Everyone is very polite, no queue jumpers here! I DESPISE QUEUE JUMPERS! All the staff members speak enough English to understand what you are saying, and will point you in the right direction for any attraction or restaurant in the park.For dining, I highly suggest that you visit both the Blue Bayou restaurant and Restaurant Hofusai. During the 25th Anniversary they are having special set menus at reasonable prices.I also highly suggest the Queen's Banquet Hall for a reasonably priced and fun lunch/dinner.Please message me if you would like more information on the themepark."
3230,5,N/A,Singapore,"Fantastic,fun. Back to my younger days :)","Love the feel and excitement when I reach the entrance to Tokyo Disneyland. Everyone is so excited and happy once they are inside the Disneyland.Many shops selling cute things, push cart trolley selling finger food and also restaurant. You can really spend the whole day without getting bored.Highly recommended to first timers who intend to visit Tokyo not to miss this fun place.From Ling, dew168"
3231,5,N/A,Malaysia,I Love Disneyland,"I have been both to disneyland paris and tokyo. I must say that both are different but disnyeland tokyo is better than the one in paris.I have been to disneyland tokyo twice. once in 1998 and again in 2007. i had a wonderful time. however, one day is not enough to see all the shows and go on rides. One would  need at least two days especially if you want to shop. The 2 day and 3 day passport are cheap ie 10,000-00 yen. Also try to buy your tickets earlier otherwise the queue is so so long in the morning and the waiting can be an agony. I got my tickets at the Shinagawa Station and it saved me a lot of time. basically it was a fun place not only for the kids but for the adults as well. the only snag is that the restraurants are  crowded and the popcorns stands are extremely long... all in all you need at least 2 days to have a good time....do not miss the private of caribeans ride and space mountain... its a must.... i had fun fun and more fun.... loved it"
3232,4,N/A,United States,"good fun, not as good as the original though","Lots of fun, and a great place to go if you're homesick for the USA.  Definitely not as good as Disneyland in Anaheim... not as many mountains, but for sure worth the trip"
3233,4,N/A,N/A,"Busy, but enjoyable enough","Lobbed here at the height of the Japanese (northern) summer, when the littlies are all on school holidays. Probably not the best time to try to get it all in, but, the park catered well for the gazillions of visitors, with water inspired parades/entertainment etc. and plenty of air conditioned venues. These aspects made it all the more enjoyable, and it was vaguely reminiscent of some of the wet t-shirt competitions I had witnessed in my youth. Layout of the park is the same basic international plan and everything is easy to find. My missus and our daughter insisted on the obligatory cup & saucer ride, and for some reason this one appeared to a little more frenzied than the other parks. I was half expecting to see a major stack on the ride, it was going that furiously, and some dads were clutching at their mid-sections upon exiting the cups...but that may have been from an excess of Kirin the night before. The kids all seemed to love it. Most dialogue with all the rides (even the Tiki room, which is identical to the one at Anaheim) is in Japanese, and Buzz Lightyear doesn't sound quite right in Japanese...but everyone gets the gist..and I still bested my 8 YO on the ride. (I now have a 4 out of 4 parks-score beating her at putting Zurg in his place). She is a big fat loser..and just won't admit it. Western style food can be a bit daunting to find, in the park, but as they say...when in Tokyo..whatever."
3234,5,N/A,United States,Great Trip,Took my family to see this newest of the Disney parks and I thoight it was fantastic. What an experience.
3235,1,N/A,Japan,The Disney Nightmare,"This was my first visit to any Disneyland, so I set out with high expectations. Firstly getting there is not too difficult,its a short train journey from Tokyo station, however to get there at opening time of 8am , means struggling through the commuter crowds of Tokyo station in the morning rush, this with young children is no fun.Anyway we arrived in one piece, to be greeted by HUGE crowds of people queing to get in to the park. Luckily we had pre purchased and breezed straight in.To be perfectly blunt, Disneyland sucked, the crowds were absolutely horrendous, it is physically impossible to do more than 3 rides a day, when you consider the cost of the ticket at 5ooo yen, just to get into the place its a total waste of money, as most of the day is spent queuing, or been insincerly smiled at by the Gestapo like ""cast members"" or staff of the park ( think rictus grinning) wearing grey German macs.Let me share some other examples of the Disney land dreamI had to queue for 1 hour just to buy a small tub of popcorn , 1 HOUR!!! , and the popcorn cost me 1000 yen ( about 10USD) .A group of elderly Korean folks were sitting in a designated area for about 1 hour before the parade begun, to pass the time they shared some food and then shared a small bottle of what was probably Korean shoju, as soon as the Gestapo saw this , gasp, small bottle of liquor ( about 200ml) been shared amoung 5 elderly koreans after eating, they went on full alert to the enoromous threat this posed, talk about over reaction, the Koreans ( all well over 60 yo) were asked to leave the area, good knows what happened to them after that.All that was available for food was really expensive poor quality fast food , that of course had to queue for ages just to order, all the ""nice"" restaurants were booked out 5 mins after the park opened.The amount of money generated by Disney at this Park must be pretty amazing , however it is obvious that the desire for profit supercedes the comfort of the park guests, Even when the park is totally full, with all the rides booked out for the entire day, they still allow people to enter the park and charge tem for entering.To anybody even considering this trip to Disney in Tokyo , forget it , dont go , the place is an expensive nightmare , I will never repeat the experience"
3236,5,N/A,United States,"A Day at Tokyo Disneyland - October, 1997","October 26, 1997Hi All:My good buddy, Brice was back in Tokyo to attend a radio class that well all must take.  I obtained Discount tickets to Tokyo Disneyland for Sunday (today).  Regular price is Y5800 or $48.75.  The discount tickets were $32.00.  You can also buy an entrance ticket, without going on any rides, however I don‚Äôt know how much that ticket costs.  Believe it or not, if you do go that route, you can buy tickets for each ride, with the ‚ÄúA, B, C, D, and E ticket rides!‚ÄùWe started out from Sinagawa train station to catch the ‚ÄúJR‚Äù line to the Tokyo Disneyland station with a train transfer at Tokyo station.  It is amazing how big Tokyo station is.  It is like LAX!  It took a 10 minute walk between platforms for the train change.  Total travel time with the change was 40 minutes.Once at the Tokyo station, it was a short walk to the main entrance.  Here is a picture of Brice and Myself just after getting off of the train.  Photo 1You know, I almost didn‚Äôt go because we have an annual pass to Disneyland back home, however, I am very glad I did.  Because of the culture differences, Disneyland Tokyo is a fascinating place!  First of all, they all have black hair!  Second of all, they all speak Japanese, and the rides are all in Japanese too!We cracked up on Pirates of the Carribean, because the pirate who says ‚ÄúDEAD MEN TELL NO TALES!‚Äù was saying it in Japanese!  In Splash Mountain, the fox and the alligator were talking and the singing was in Japanese!  C3P0 was talking in Japanese too in Start Tours!  The ‚ÄúGhost Host‚Äù in the Haunted Mansion was probably my personal favorite.  I have been on the ride so many times in my life, I knew what he was saying as we were going down the elevator, but I was cracking up because it was almost like we were going on these rides for the very first time!Here is a picture of me with one of the balloon girls on Main Street. The Main Street area is all enclosed with a giant glass roof structure in case of rain.  One of the first things you notice is that there is much more open space than Disneyland.  Photo 2Here is a picture of Brice in the middle of a crowd of Asians in Tokyo Disneyland.  Take note of all the dark hair!  (Now take note of how little hair Brice has!) Photo 3Actually, even though the park holds many more people than at Disneyland, the longest wait for a ride was only 60 minutes.  There were a couple attractions that they had here that they didn‚Äôt have at home.  One of them was kind of a Carousel of Progress based on the History of Japan.  It too was in Japanese, however they had speakers in the back of the theater that were in English (you hold them up to your ear).  The most interesting part in this attraction was how they handled the part about the war.  There was some visuals of war (basic, no A-bomb blast or anything, and very brief), and the children said ‚Äúwhy is it so dark?‚Äù  Then the main character said, ‚ÄúThat was a dark period......but that is over now....‚Äù  Brice and I looked at each other with big open eyes!Lunch time, again!Do they have hamburgers????  NO, but I found this Chinese restaurant that had pretty good food!  We had the chow mein with beef and broccoli, and lemon chicken.  Actually, It was probably one of the better Disney meals I have had!Here is a picture of Brice and I eating our lunch.  I kind of felt sorry for Brice because of that last comment I made about his hair, so I kind of fixed his problem for him. Photo 4The ‚Äúlands‚Äù in Disneyland Tokyo were basically the same with one exception: ‚ÄúFrontier Land‚Äù is called ‚ÄúWestern Land.‚Äù  We get a big kick out of this because in Japan they have toilets that are basically ground level, so one would have to ‚Äúsquat‚Äù if they had to use it.  However, in some places, like our JAL training center, they have installed toilets like we do back home.  They label the stalls ‚ÄúWESTERN STYLE.‚Äù  When was the last time you had a ‚ÄúWestern Style?‚ÄùSpeaking of JAL, I was able to ‚ÄúBUZZ‚Äù Cinderella Castle...here, I will show you the picture......Photo 5Well, what did you think?  Did you get a good laugh?  Good!Actually, that was part of the Rocket Jets ride in Tomorrow Land.  The ride is sponsored by JAL, and they have their logo on the side of the jets!  Pretty cool, huh?Here is a shot of the ride up close.......Photo 6The Haunted Mansion looks a little different.Here is a picture of it.....Photo 7You are almost done....remember, the best is always last!Of course, Brice and I got many good photo opportunities.  We had an idea to get our instructors each a ‚ÄúMickey Mouse-ears‚Äù Hat with their names on it, but we were too cheap!!So we opted for the photo opportunity instead....Here are the ‚ÄúGoof Brothers!‚Äù  Photo 8One of my goals was to go on the attractions that we didn‚Äôt have at our Disneyland at home.  Here in Tokyo Disneyland, they have an awesome Cinderella  Castle, as you saw in a previous picture.  They also have an attraction called Cinderella Castle Mystery Tour.The map said that the tour was in Japanese only, but we didn‚Äôt care.  So we started out on this tour with this nice looking Japanese girl as our guide.  The tour lasted a good 15 minutes as we walked all throughout the immense castle.  They had great visual effects, including the ‚Äúevil mirror‚Äù on the wall, again speaking his evil tongue in his native Japanese language!  Our tour guide was trying to get the people involved, however the Japanese are not very outward people, so I decided to take it upon myself to help her out...When she seemed frightened, I gasped!  When we saw a fire eating dragon, I made panicky noises as we all shuffled into the elevator.  Then she went on to explain something about how dangerous this is going to get, and I said, ‚ÄúHUH?‚Äù in a loud voice, and everyone broke up laughing!Well, she liked my attitude so when it appeared that we were all going to die, she called on me to save the entire tour!  She called ‚ÄúBob-san!‚Äù  ‚ÄúDozo!‚Äù  (Please), and motioned me to the front.  I then grabbed the mighty sword, and pointed it (much in the same fashion that Mickey did in Fantasia) to the Giant ugly, evil spirit, and thrust it in his direction!  Then a powerful beam of light came from my sword and Zapped the lowly spirit DEAD!With that, our guide swiftly took me to the sacred pedestal, where she made some speech (that I could not understand).  She then placed a bronze medallion over my head proclaiming ‚ÄúOUR HERO!‚Äù  During her speech, I was making funny eye movements and hand gestures to get the crowd laughing.  I even tried to get a little ‚Äúpeck‚Äù on the cheek for my extreme bravery, but to no avail.  When it was all said and done, the audience was on their feet (because there was no place to sit down) applauding their new H-E-R-O!  ‚ÄúBOB-SAN!,‚Äù ‚ÄúBOB-SAN!‚Äù they cheered, as our pretty guide opened the door and said, ‚ÄúSayonara‚Äù, and some other more popular Japanese words to indicate to us that the Cinderella Castle Mystery Tour was indeed, over!  Now this was one tour that I never wanted to end!For the final picture, I give you the picture of our lovely tour guide, and tour ‚ÄúHero!‚Äù Photo 9If you ever get the chance to visit Tokyo, don‚Äôt pass up the opportunity to see Tokyo Disneyland.  It really put Walt Disney‚Äôs dream in perspective.I hope you enjoyed this special Japan update!"
3237,5,N/A,N/A,Great experience,"I have not been to the US ones but compared to Paris, Tokyo beats it hands down! It is clean & beautifully maintained. The food quality was a lot better and queue system a lot more efficient. Disney cast members were a lot more smiley & genuinely helpful & friendly. It made for a great experience for our family!If you go during the weekdays, the queues are very manageable. Avoid Sat, Sun & public or school holidays! We were there on Thu & Fri and saw a significant build-up in the number of people on Fri compared to Thu. Fast Passes were very quick to run out on the more popular rides (Pooh's Hunny Hunt, Buzz Lightyear's Astroblasters) by early afternoon -- and the park closes at 10pm! We stayed outside the Disney resort area in a Disney Partner hotel called Palm & Fountain Terrace Hotel (has English website). It is a family hotel tailored to the Japanese market but has English speaking staff. Plus points are that it has 4 twin beds in a spacious room (by Japanese standards) - great for a family of 4, a 24-hour grocery store for breakfast/snack supplies & complimentary shuttle to & from the resort."
3238,5,N/A,N/A,"Spacious, manageable if you plan accordingly","Very similar to Disneyland in Anaheim except it's a lot more spacious and much cleaner, with more shops.  You'll really like the extra square footage because there will be tons of people when you arrive.If you've been to other disney parks then you know you have to do some major strategic planning beforehand, that is, when to visit the park.  If you plan on visiting ANY disney park during the middle of summer on a weekday then expect a rough time!  I totally avoided this by going in early June (Japanese schoolkids don't get out till July) weekday evening.  Yes, evening. I was able to get one of those evening passes that are heavily discounted.  All in all, i was able to ride just about everything that was worthwhile (at least 6-7 rides, plus space mountain twice) all in the several hoours until the park closed at 11pm.  Quite unreal.  I didn't expect to do this.  But was able to later analyze why this was so.When I arrived, the park was PACKED.  I mean every square foot had a person on it.  Majority were schoolkids in uniform!  I was shocked as I never seen any school in the US take a joyride trip to disney or any other amusement park for that matter.. But anyways, all these schoolkids depart around 6-7pm.  And I do mean ALL.  The park then becomes home mainly to repeat Tokyo adult customers, many of whom I learned come every week or so!  Anyhow, shopping for Disney stuff is incredible here.  Say goodbye to that trash you find in Disney stores; you're going to find some really good stuff here and the prices are in line too.  Overall, well worth the visit."
3239,1,N/A,Australia,Only 3 rides a day here and huge crowds,"We arrived with our 3 kids at about 9:30 after a short train ride from Tokyo on the JR line. Disney must be making billions here, the crowds were beyond belief! Far busier than Shinjuku station!! Wait times for all major rides were almost 2 hours, the minor ride waits were 10-40 minutes. We only managed 3 major rides all day, and that's with a 'fastpass' The Fast pass is for Disney's benefit, not visitors. We got a fast pass for The Thunder Mountain ride at about 12:30, we could only ride at 17:40 more than 5 hours later!!! This was quick though, some rides had a 6-7 hour wait or were sold out completely.Wait times for the ladies toilet was 30 minutes, even the mens toilet had a long line, something I've never seen before.There are no vending machines here, so expect a 10-40 minute wait to buy even a bottle of water which was grossly overpriced. Better still bring your own food and water, otherwise you'll spend hours waiting to buy them.There was hardly any space even to sit anywhere, we had to stand all day with our young children, amongst the crowds and heat.None of the staff speak much English, so if you need help with anything you'll struggle. For information wait in the long line (30 mins wait) at ""Guest relations"" near the main entrance.This would rate as one of the worst tourist experiences in my life, and we were well and truly 'ripped off'. Much better to visit the Australian theme parks which are great value for money. We spent about $650 for entrance and food/drinks and only had 3 major rides all day with huge waits. Never again!"
3240,5,N/A,United States,"A lot like Disneyland in America, only cleaner and even prettier!","A lot of people were surprised when I told them that one of my primary destinations during my trip to Japan would be Tokyo Disneyland.  My sister and I booked four nights at an official Disneyland hotel and bought 3-day park passes just to be sure that we'd be able to see everything the Disneyland resort had to offer.  Sure, we'd been to Disney World a number of times and knew that this would be similar, but we'd heard that the Tokyo Park was really something special.  And we weren't disappointed!Arriving at the Park:The Disney run hotels were too pricey for us, but we were quite pleased with our room at the Sheraton Grande Tokyo Bay.  We could get to the parks in a matter of minutes on the gorgeous and impeccably run Disney monorail.  It isn't free like the one in Orlando, but it's even nicer and runs more frequently.  Our first morning at Disneyland, we were immediate struck by how clean and orderly everything was.  The Japanese arrive at the parks early, forming long queues and patiently waiting for the turnstiles to open.  Be sure to buy your tickets in advance, so that you can get immediately in to the entrance line, instead of having to wait in the ticket line as well.  They cost about $50 for one day, $130 for my three-day pass.  After the park opened, most Japanese folks skipped briskly over to Pooh's Hunny Hunt, the most popular ride at the park by far.  It is indeed a cool ride, but you have to be a very early-rising pooh bear to get on it without a long wait.  In general, long wait times were typical.  The Japanese have a tremendous capacity for quietly waiting in line.  Certain foods and rides are actually made more desirable because one gains the pride and prestige of having waiting through a long queue in order to get to the attraction.  But don't be discouraged--if you use your head, the lines are easily avoidable.  Make use of fast pass whenever possible and go on the popular stuff first thing in the morning and later in the evening.The Rides:Most of the rides are the same as in Orlando, only newer and in Japanese.  A few rides were even a bit better than their Orlando equivalent.  Splash Mountain was even more exciting, with more drops and turns, plus a carefully controlled splash at the end (I suspect that the Japanese are not so thrilled at the thought of getting soaked on a ride).  Also, some of the attractions that have been retired from the Orlando park have been relocated to Tokyo.  For me, having so many fond nostalgic memories of the Disney World of my childhood, running into these attractions again was like finding a long lost friend.  The Mickey Mouse Revue is here in Tokyo and going strong.  Tokyo Disneyland also has the Main Street Electrical parade, Frontierland canoes, the Penny Arcade, many old costumed characters like Joe Carioca and Clarabell Cow, and all that white, kitschy architecture from the original Tomorrowland.The Food:The themed dining options at Tokyo Disneyland put Orlando's Magic Kingdom's dining to shame.  Tokyo Disneyland has a large number of impeccably themed and interesting restaurants covering all range of budgets and tastes.  Our favorite restaurant was the Queen of Hearts Banquet Hall.  The decor was eye-boggling -- like walking straight into Alice in Wonderland, complete with flowers for lamps, clouds on the ceiling, paying card guards lining the halls, and of course, smiley costumed waitresses lurking around every corner waiting to help you.  We also enjoyed the Blue Bayou restaurant at Pirates of the Caribbean.  Though rather expensive, the food was outstanding, and the atmosphere was the most romantic I'd ever seen in a restaurant.  Even the small eateries where we stopped for just a snack were also fully decked out with cute, careful decor covering every inch.  Of course, this is still Japan, so don't expect to find all of the usual American snack foods.  At one restaurant I ordered sweet potatoes, and much to my surprise they came out in fried slabs covered with sugar syrup and shaped like Mickey's head.  Strange, but still good!  Every restaurant we ate at had menus in English and Japanese, but don't expect your server to know more than a few words in English.Overall, I would highly recommend Tokyo Disneyland to anyone with children or with a childlike sense of fun.  Together with its sister park, DisneySea, the Tokyo Disney resort is a truly impressive park experience that I would happily do again if I'm ever able to return to Japan."
3241,4,N/A,United States,Different Yet the Same,"Tokyo Disneyland has a lot of the same rides and a similar layout to Disneyland in California. I think there are fewer rides here, and this one is definitely more crowded! I've been several times and really enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend the Pooh's Honey Hunt ride which is great! More imaginitive and nicely done than any ride at Disneyland in California! Otherwise most of the rides are the same. Overall a great place, but if you're familiar with Disneyland California and DisneyWorld, then I probably wouldn't go out of my way to get here. Go to DisneySea instead!"
